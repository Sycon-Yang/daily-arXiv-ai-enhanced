*Tian Lan,Yang-Hao Zhou,Zi-Ao Ma,Fanshu Sun,Rui-Qing Sun,Junyu Luo,Rong-Cheng Tu,Heyan Huang,Chen Xu,Zhijing Wu,Xian-Ling Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review and unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across text, visual, and audio modalities, identifying five fundamental paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic framework for automatic evaluation methods across different modalities.

Method: Review and unify taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods.

Result: Identified five fundamental paradigms for evaluation approaches across text, image, and audio generation.

Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates the broad applicability of the framework across different modalities and suggests promising directions for future cross-modal evaluation research.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce TaskCraft, an automated workflow for creating scalable agentic tasks with tool interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction data lacks tool interaction and current agentic benchmarks have limitations.

Method: Expands atomic tasks using depth-based and width-based extensions.

Result: Improved prompt optimization and supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models.

Conclusion: TaskCraft provides a large-scale synthetic dataset to support future research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

### [3] [A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077)
*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues against the classical view that linguistic forms possess meaning by themselves and proposes that meaning is actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act. Experiments with LLMs showed non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inherent limitations faced by large language models and other modern NLP systems due to semantic degeneracy.

Method: The researchers conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as computational cognitive systems to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings.

Result: The experiments resulted in average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with some runs violating the classical boundary significantly.

Conclusion: The study concludes that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity exhibits non-classical contextuality, suggesting that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are lossy.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) to examine how large language models react differently to semantically identical prompts due to variations at the token level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how large language models behave when responding to prompts that vary only at the token level but have the same semantic intent.

Method: Proposed Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) as a diagnostic framework to measure behavioral drift in LLMs with semantically equivalent prompt rewordings.

Result: The research found consistent, model-specific response shifts across ten constrained tasks, indicating potential statistical regularities related to tokenization and decoding processes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that there are model-specific response shifts linked to tokenization and decoding, which affect the stability of large language models under semantically equivalent prompt rewordings.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Propose ChartReasoner, a novel two-stage framework for precise visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning approaches often lose critical information when converting visual reasoning tasks into textual ones.

Method: Convert chart images into structured ECharts codes, then use these codes to automatically generate chart reasoning trajectories and train the final multimodal model.

Result: ChartReasoner preserves chart details well and performs comparably to state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner demonstrates effectiveness in visual reasoning tasks across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: We introduce a new unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune pretrained language models on their own generated labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks without high-quality human supervision.

Method: Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM)

Result: On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision.

Conclusion: Our method matches the performance of training on golden supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models perform well in empathic communication tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reliability of large language models in judging the nuances of empathic communication.

Method: Comparing annotations of empathic communication by experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs using four evaluative frameworks.

Result: LLMs perform as well as experts and better than crowdworkers.

Conclusion: LLMs can be reliable tools for emotionally sensitive applications if properly validated.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance sentiment analysis in languages with limited resources, focusing on Bangla's distinctive regional expressions and cultural features.

Method: Employed machine learning models (Linear SVM, KNN, Random Forest) with n-gram data from TF-IDF vectorizer, investigated PCA effect, and used BiLSTM model and AdaBoost to improve decision trees, explained predictions with LIME.

Result: Analyzed 22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset to identify efficient emotion identification techniques in Bangla.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of emotions in written Bangla by examining various techniques and providing explanations for machine learning model predictions.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

TL;DR: This paper develops a comprehensive list of human capital (HC)-related keywords using a machine learning algorithm trained on confirmed HC disclosures. The authors share their lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and Python code, and provide examples for using their data and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of well-defined measurement or disclosure rules for HC, which is crucial for corporate value creation.

Method: The authors use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to classify keywords into five subcategories.

Result: A comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories was developed.

Conclusion: The paper provides a lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and Python code for researchers to address pertinent HC questions and discusses future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [11] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work evaluates LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories despite the challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation.

Method: Using LLMs to solve narrative planning problems.

Result: GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales but require reinforcement learning for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories but face challenges in planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method called Q2E improves video retrieval for complex real-world events by extracting latent parametric knowledge from large language models and vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events.

Method: Query-to-Event decomposition method adaptable across datasets, domains, large language models, or vision-language models.

Result: Enhances understanding of human queries by decomposing them with knowledge from large language models and vision-language models. Also applies to visual and speech-based inputs.

Conclusion: Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in text-to-video retrieval and integrating audio information significantly improves retrieval.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [13] [TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209)
*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TTT-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in large reasoning models (LRMs) using four Tic-Tac-Toe-style games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains beyond the STEM domain.

Method: Proposes a scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems for TTT-Bench.

Result: Most state-of-the-art LRMs perform worse on TTT-Bench compared to their performance on math problem sets like MATH 500 and AIME 2024, particularly struggling with long-term strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: The study reveals that LRMs which excel at complex math problems often fail at simpler reasoning tasks requiring strategic and spatial understanding.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Identify unreliable narrators in texts from various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if computational methods can be used to detect unintentional misinformation in narrators.

Method: Using literary theory to categorize narrators and creating a human-annotated dataset named TUNa. Analyzing different types of unreliability and testing various LLMs under different learning settings.

Result: The task is difficult but LLMs show potential in identifying unreliable narrators.

Conclusion: Inviting further research in this area and releasing an expert-annotated dataset and code.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

TL;DR: ToxSyn-PT 是首个大型葡萄牙语语料库，支持对九个受法律保护的少数群体进行细粒度仇恨言论分类。该数据集包含53,274个合成句子，均匀分布在少数群体和毒性标签之间。通过四阶段管道创建：手动整理的种子、少量展示扩展、基于释义的增强以及富集和额外的中性文本以遏制过度拟合。实验表明其在二元和多标签分类任务中表现强劲，具有强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集主要来自社交媒体，存在领域限制且缺乏多样性。本研究旨在构建一个多样化、平衡的语料库，用于低资源环境下的仇恨言论检测。

Method: 提出了一种新的四阶段管道方法来创建ToxSyn-PT，包括使用指令微调的语言模型进行少量展示扩展和基于释义的增强等步骤。

Result: 在五个公共葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上进行了二元和多标签分类实验，结果表现出色，并显示出跨领域的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT 的发布将推动合成数据和低资源环境下仇恨言论检测的研究进展。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

### [16] [Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268)
*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions through iterative sampling. It shows that under certain conditions, these models can exhibit deterministic decision-making and introduces a method to differentiate between stochastic and deterministic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models have Bayesian-like reasoning capabilities.

Method: Revisiting the assumption of probabilistic decision-making in language models and proposing a method to detect misleading prior inference during simulated Gibbs sampling.

Result: Found that language models can exhibit deterministic behavior, such as maximum likelihood estimations, even at non-zero sampling temperatures. Demonstrated that without careful analysis, deterministic systems undergoing Gibbs sampling might converge to false priors.

Conclusion: The study reveals that language models do not always operate based on probabilistic assumptions, providing insights into their decision-making processes and suggesting a way to correctly interpret their behavior.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

*Zige Wang,Qi Zhu,Fei Mi,Minghui Xu,Ruochun Jin,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes ClusterUCB, an efficient gradient-based data selection framework using clustering and a modified UCB algorithm for large language model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based data influence approximation is resource-intensive during supervised fine-tuning of large language models.

Method: ClusterUCB uses clustering to group similar data samples and modifies UCB algorithm to allocate computing budget across clusters, estimating distribution and balancing exploration-exploitation.

Result: ClusterUCB achieves comparable performance to original gradient-based methods but with significantly reduced computational consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed ClusterUCB framework efficiently selects useful data samples in large language model fine-tuning with less resource usage.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [18] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flick is a novel method for few-label text classification in low-resource linguistic contexts. It improves pseudo-label quality by refining high-confidence labels from initial clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation in low-resource settings.

Method: Flick introduces a new pseudo-label refinement component that uses single-cluster cohesion and adaptive top-k selection.

Result: Flick performs well across 14 diverse datasets, including challenging low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Flick addresses the challenges of few-label text classification in low-resource settings, offering a more reliable approach than previous methods.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the impact of user-provided suggestions on large language models within an educational setting, revealing that response quality significantly varies depending on how questions are framed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of sycophantic responses in educational settings when using large language models.

Method: Testing five different LLMs from OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions.

Result: Response quality varies dramatically based on query framing; mentioning incorrect answers degrades accuracy by up to 15%, while correct ones boost it similarly. Bias is stronger in smaller models, with GPT-4.1-nano showing up to 30% effect compared to 8% for GPT-4o. Analysis confirms models change answers according to mentioned choices, supporting the sycophancy hypothesis.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a need to understand and mitigate such biases in educational contexts to ensure equitable learning opportunities.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

*Hayato Futami,Emiru Tsunoo,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Yuki Ito,Hassan Shahmohammadi,Siddhant Arora,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Propose a new training approach called scheduled interleaved speech-text training for speech-to-speech translation using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of modality adaptation from text to speech when fine-tuning LLMs on speech data.

Method: Scheduled interleaved speech-text training uses interleaved speech-text units during training and gradually reduces the ratio of text as training progresses.

Result: The proposed method improves translation performance, especially for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: Scheduled interleaved speech-text training is effective for speech-to-speech translation.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

TL;DR: A scalable method is proposed to generate high-quality CoT supervision datasets by utilizing program execution determinism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision for training large language models.

Method: Extract verifiable reasoning traces from code execution and convert them into natural language CoT reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in equipping LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The method generates highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的TableRAG框架用于异构文档问答，该框架解决了现有RAG方法的局限性，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG方法在处理包含文本和表格组件的异构文档时表现出关键限制，包括信息丢失和推理能力下降的问题。

Method: TableRAG框架，它通过四个步骤迭代操作：上下文敏感的查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程和执行以及组合中间答案生成。

Result: TableRAG在公共数据集和新的HeteQA基准上都优于现有方法，并且开放了源代码。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在公共数据集和新基准上都优于现有基线，确立了异构文档问答的新最先进水平。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAG is a new approach allowing LLMs to self-correct through a verify-then-revise process, enhancing both reasoning and verification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions for verifying LLMs' outputs have limitations like requiring separate verifier models or complex multi-stage training.

Method: Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG)

Result: PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism that revises answers only when errors are detected, improving performance on various reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: PAG framework improves both reasoning and verification abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of MLLMs to handle temporal order understanding using both visual and linguistic modalities.

Method: Designs three main tests within TempVS: event relation inference, sentence ordering, and image ordering, each with a basic grounding test.

Result: Evaluates 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs showing they struggle with TempVS compared to human capabilities.

Conclusion: Highlights performance gaps and provides insights for future research directions while releasing TempVS benchmark data and code.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

*Avneet Kaur,Arnav Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how news media frames conflicts, specifically the Israel-Palestine war, and finds a stronger focus on war rather than peace journalism. It also highlights biases in reporting across different regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain deeper insights into conflict framing by analyzing indicators of war and peace journalism in news articles.

Method: Using computational approaches that combine frame semantics and large language models to identify communicative and linguistic framing.

Result: A greater emphasis on war-related reporting and regional differences in framing the parties involved in the conflict, revealing media biases.

Conclusion: News media's framing of conflicts can significantly influence public opinion and may exacerbate tensions, with notable regional variations in bias.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Hongwei Zhang,Yifeng Jiao,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study improves the efficiency of large language model reasoning by adjusting the reward function and introducing a novel penalty for output length. This approach shows better performance in shorter outputs and/or higher accuracy across three different datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, especially addressing the issue of longer outputs increasing computational latency.

Method: Dividing the reward function and adding a novel penalty for output length to promote conciseness for simpler problems and maintain sufficient reasoning for complex ones.

Result: The method shows improved outcomes in benchmark evaluations across GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024 datasets. It shortens output lengths while maintaining or enhancing accuracy on simpler datasets and improves accuracy on the more complex AIME2024 dataset.

Conclusion: Our approach optimizes LLM reasoning efficiency by balancing output length and reasoning depth based on problem complexity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

*Xanh Ho,Sunisth Kumar,Yun-Ang Wu,Florian Boudin,Atsuhiro Takasu,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reframes table-text alignment as an explanation task, builds a new dataset with human-annotated cell-level rationales, and shows that incorporating table alignment information improves claim verification performance but most LLMs fail to recover human-aligned rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of limited interpretability when predicting the final label alone.

Method: Reframing table-text alignment as an explanation task and identifying essential table cells for claim verification.

Result: Improved claim verification performance and identified issues with LLMs' predictions.

Conclusion: Incorporating table alignment information improves claim verification performance, but most LLMs fail to recover human-aligned rationales.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates bias in large language models (LLMs), finding that pre-prompted personae on MMLU tasks show negligible differences in scores, while grading user answers and salary negotiation advice reveal more significant bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large datasets that contain controversial and stereotypical content, leading to biased viewpoints and results based on assigned or user personalities.

Method: The authors evaluate models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark (MMLU), reformulate tasks to ask models to grade user answers, and request advice for salary negotiations.

Result: Evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on MMLU tasks leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores. Grading user answers and asking for salary negotiation advice show more significant signs of bias.

Conclusion: As LLMs become more personalized and have memory capabilities, the issue of bias becomes more prominent as models may infer socio-demographics without explicit prompts.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Motivation: Conventional DST benchmarks fail to capture the complexities of real-world multi-user interactions.

Method: Extend an existing DST dataset by generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory and incorporate them into conversations.

Result: Performance drop is observed in multi-user DST compared to single-user DST.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in extracting and tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers, emphasizing the need for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RRP, a framework that combines large language models with knowledge graphs to improve reasoning abilities by mining reliable reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models in handling knowledge-intensive tasks due to lack of background knowledge and tendency to hallucinate, and to refine relationships among facts for complex question solving.

Method: Proposes RRP framework that uses relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning to mine knowledge graphs, combined with a rethinking module to evaluate and refine reasoning paths.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: RRP generates high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions, providing effective guidance for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new unsupervised method for reconstructing ancestral word forms (protoforms) by combining data-driven inference with linguistically motivated rules within an evolutionary optimization framework. The method outperforms previous approaches when reconstructing Latin protoforms from five Romance languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing protoforms rely heavily on probabilistic models that are limited by their data-driven nature. There is a need for a more linguistically informed approach that combines statistical patterns with linguistic constraints.

Method: The proposed method integrates data-driven inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization framework to guide the reconstruction process.

Result: The method shows significant improvement over established baselines in terms of character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility when reconstructing Latin protoforms from cognates of five Romance languages.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining data-driven and rule-based methods within an evolutionary optimization framework proves effective for reconstructing ancestral word forms.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how large language models handle character-level information during the spelling-out process, revealing that LLMs depend on higher layers to reconstruct this knowledge, showing a breakthrough in their spelling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how large language models internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process.

Method: Probing classifiers, identification of knowledge neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Result: LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where there's a distinct 'breakthrough' in their spelling behavior.

Conclusion: Spelling out is not handled straightforwardly by LLMs despite being a simple task for humans. The embedding layer does not fully encode character-level information beyond the first character.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Motivation: 检测危及生命的语言对于保护处于困境中的人们、促进心理健康和福祉以及预防潜在的危害和生命损失至关重要。

Method: 使用Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2三种开源大型语言模型的7B参数变体进行微调，并在具有类别平衡、不平衡和极端不平衡情景的数据集上进行实验。同时，将这些大型语言模型的表现与传统的词袋模型、词嵌入、主题建模和双向编码器表示从Transformer模型的方法进行了比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，大型语言模型在识别危及生命的文本方面比传统方法表现更好。Mistral和Llama-2模型在平衡和不平衡数据场景中表现最好，而Gemma模型稍逊一些。上采样技术虽然对传统方法有益，但对大型语言模型影响不大。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，大型语言模型在识别危及生命的文本方面表现出色，并且在平衡和不平衡数据场景中，Mistral和Llama-2模型的表现最佳。虽然上采样技术对传统方法有帮助，但对大型语言模型的影响较小。这项研究展示了大型语言模型在现实世界中的巨大潜力，可以用于解决危及生命的语言检测问题。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Motivation: To establish hypernymy between adjectives in the Open English Wordnet which has many missing links.

Method: Theoretical discussion of hypernymy relation for adjectives and its difference from nouns and verbs, developing a new resource for adjective hypernymy, and fine-tuning large language models.

Result: A new resource for adjective hypernymy is created and large language models are successfully fine-tuned to predict it.

relation and how it differs for adjectives in contrast to nouns and verbs. We
develop a new resource for adjective hypernymy and fine-tune large language
models to predict adjective hypernymy, showing that the methodology of
TaxoLLaMa can be adapted to this task.

*Ye Yu,Yaoning Yu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMISE is a prompt-only framework that reduces reasoning overhead for large reasoning models without modifying model weights, achieving high accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of unnecessary verbosity in lengthy chain-of-thought reasoning used by large reasoning models, which inflates token usage and cost, limiting their deployment in certain settings.

Method: Introduces PREMISE, combining trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to optimize brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search.

Result: On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500, PREMISE matches or exceeds baseline accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% and cutting dollar cost by 69--82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

### [38] [Beyond True or False: Retrieval-Augmented Hierarchical Analysis of Nuanced Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10728)
*Priyanka Kargupta,Runchu Tian,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents ClaimSpect, a framework for breaking down complex claims into hierarchical aspects and retrieving relevant information from a corpus to provide a comprehensive perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods often label claims as entirely true or false, but many claims are nuanced and require detailed analysis.

Method: ClaimSpect uses a retrieval-augmented generation approach to create a hierarchy of aspects and sub-aspects for claims, retrieving relevant segments from a corpus to identify new sub-aspects and varying perspectives.

Result: The framework was applied to a diverse dataset of scientific and political claims, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in deconstructing claims and representing perspectives within a corpus.

Conclusion: ClaimSpect offers a more comprehensive and structured way to address nuanced claims, enabling readers to prioritize specific angles of interest.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature due to the rapid evolution of scientific fields and the limitations of existing automatic taxonomy construction methods.

Method: Performing iterative hierarchical classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus' topical distribution.

Result: Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of computer science conferences over the years.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are more granularity-preserving and coherent than the most competitive baselines.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

TL;DR: Pretrain LLMs for many languages at once is difficult because of limited model capacity, scarce high-quality data, and compute constraints. A universal tokenizer can improve model's language plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited model capacity, scarce high-quality data, and compute constraints make it challenging to pretrain LLMs for many languages at once. The lack of language coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages purely at the post-training stage.

Method: Propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation in expanding language coverage after pretraining.

Result: Systematic experiments across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining languages. Also leads to better plasticity towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining, by up to 5% win rate gain.

Conclusion: Achieve adaptation to an expanded set of languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages included in pretraining.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

Motivation: To deploy large language models in high-stakes domains like clinical decision support, accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are needed.

Method: The paper compares standard single-generation and sampling-based methods and explores simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in reasoning traces.

Result: Lightweight methods can perform similarly to Semantic Entropy with only one generation.

Conclusion: There is substantial variation in performance across specialties and question types, highlighting the need to select models according to the nature of the question and model-specific strengths.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using a large language model to reduce word error rate of named entities in automatic speech recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of named entity recognition in ASR systems which is critical for downstream applications.

Method: Introducing a revision mechanism that leverages the reasoning ability of a large language model and local context with correct named entities.

Result: Achieved up to 30% relative WER reduction for named entities on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces the word error rate of named entities in ASR systems.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

TL;DR: Propose LangEdit, a new method to efficiently update multilingual knowledge in large language models without destroying existing knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating multilingual knowledge in large language models while preserving consistent factual representations across languages is a long-standing and unresolved challenge.

Method: A novel null-space constrained framework designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates by projecting parameter updates for each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.

Result: LangEdit demonstrates superior performance in mitigating parameter interference and improving multilingual generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge.

Conclusion: LangEdit can effectively mitigate parameter interference and outperform existing state-of-the-art editing methods.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: ReCUT is a novel method to balance reasoning accuracy and length, reducing reasoning lengths by 30-50% while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT prompting methods often suffer from overthinking and overfitting issues, which limit their effectiveness.

Method: ReCUT uses a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy to generate diverse reasoning paths and trains two specialized Gemini LLMs.

Result: ReCUT reduces reasoning lengths by 30-50% with maintained or improved accuracy on multiple math reasoning datasets and backbone models.

Conclusion: ReCUT provides an effective way to compress reasoning trajectories for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel dynamic sampling strategy called SlowFast Sampling is proposed to improve diffusion-based language models (dLLMs). This method achieves significant speedup while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for dLLMs suffer from static behavior, resulting in suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility.

Method: SlowFast Sampling alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages guided by certainty, convergence, and positional principles. It is also integrated with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.

Result: Experiments show that SlowFast Sampling can achieve up to 15.63x speedup on LLaDA and up to 34.22x when combined with caching. The approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput.

Conclusion: Well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Motivation: To examine whether the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Method: Use probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical tones, and speaker information are represented.

Result: For all pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, and layerwise patterns of probing accuracy are similar.

Conclusion: The structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Method: MedRef includes a knowledge refining mechanism to screen out irrelevant medical information and improve predictions of significant medical entities in replies. It also has a comprehensive prompt structure that integrates historical and evident details. Furthermore, it implements two important modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, which offer suitable knowledge and demonstrations within the system prompt.

Result: MedRef performs better than leading models in generation quality and medical entity accuracy according to experiments conducted on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedRef surpasses current advanced models in terms of response generation quality and medical entity precision, indicating its practicality in real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve
task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2)
performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

### [50] [Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887)
*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the phenomenon of out-of-context reasoning (OCR) in large language models (LLMs), demonstrating that OCR enables both beneficial generalization and harmful hallucination based on whether concepts are causally related. The authors provide a theoretical framework explaining OCR's origins and propose insights into mitigating its negative effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs can generalize well from new facts but also tend to hallucinate incorrect information.

Method: Experiments across five LLMs and theoretical analysis formalizing OCR as a synthetic factual recall task, comparing models with factorized vs. combined weight matrices.

Result: OCR is confirmed as the underlying mechanism driving both generalization and hallucination in LLMs. Matrix factorization is shown to play a crucial role in learning OCR.

Conclusion: OCR is explained mathematically via gradient descent's implicit bias towards minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix, offering a new perspective for analyzing and addressing undesirable knowledge injection behaviors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

TL;DR: A new encoder model called BioClinical ModernBERT is introduced which improves speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP by continued pretraining on a large corpus and leveraging diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of limited domain adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings due to slower development of encoders compared to decoder models.

Method: Continued pretraining on a large biomedical and clinical corpus with over 53.5 billion tokens and leveraging 20 datasets from diverse institutions, domains, and geographic regions.

Result: BioClinical ModernBERT improves speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP.

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

### [52] [Beyond Gold Standards: Epistemic Ensemble of LLM Judges for Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10903)
*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using an ensemble of LLM judges to automatically evaluate autoformalization tasks in formal mathematics, showing stronger correlation with human assessments than generic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective automatic evaluation methods for autoformalization, especially in complex domains like advanced mathematics.

Method: Introduces an ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges based on logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality.

Result: The EFG ensemble shows better correlation with human assessments compared to coarse-grained models, particularly in evaluating formal qualities.

Conclusion: LLM-as-judges can provide scalable, interpretable, and reliable evaluation support for formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Identify interpretable features in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding directions that capture interpretable features in an unsupervised way.

Method: Directly decompose MLP activations using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF).

Result: SNMF derived features outperform other methods on causal steering and align with human-interpretable concepts.

Conclusion: SNMF is a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features in LLMs.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses the concept of 'epistemic friction' in aligning large language models with human preferences, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting belief updates in dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the utility of large language models in human-AI collaborative scenarios by considering the role of epistemic friction.

Method: The method involves defining dynamic epistemic friction and positioning it within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic.

Result: The result shows that the model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief updates in dialogues.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of considering epistemic friction in the alignment of large language models with human preferences.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel method called Domain2Vec is introduced to decompose datasets into meta-domains, enabling efficient identification of optimal data mixtures for language model pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and scalability of language model pretraining by finding optimal data mixtures with minimal computational overhead.

Method: Decomposing datasets into a linear combination of meta-domains and using a classifier to generate domain vectors corresponding to a distribution over a vocabulary of meta-domains.

Result: Domain2Vec reduces the computation required for achieving the same validation loss on Pile-CC by 48.5% and improves downstream performance by 2.83% under equivalent compute budget.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec provides a training-free way to enhance the efficiency and scalability of language model pretraining by aligning data distributions.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven data science agents are limited by rigid workflows and inflexibility, which hinders their performance on complex tasks requiring empirical expertise.

Method: AutoMind introduces three key advances: a curated expert knowledge base, an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm for strategic exploration, and a self-adaptive coding strategy to tailor code generation based on task complexity.

Result: Evaluations show that AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on automated data science benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance, effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a significant advancement towards fully automated data science with its adaptive and knowledgeable approach.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the self-reevaluation abilities of reasoning models and finds that while they are effective at identifying unhelpful thoughts, they struggle to recover from them, especially in larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how effectively reasoning models can perform self-reevaluation in identifying and recovering from unhelpful thoughts.

Method: Investigating the performance of reasoning models in identifying and recovering from four types of unhelpful thoughts.

Result: Models are effective at identifying unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from them, especially in larger models. Non/inverse-scaling trends were observed where larger models struggle more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts.

Conclusion: The study calls for improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better reasoning and safer systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

Conclusion: 提出的模型通过对话延续训练有效捕捉了描述语义，解决了caption变化的问题，实现了强大的指令跟随功能。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A novel method combining conditional entropy loss and speaker codes improves speech recognition adaptation to new speakers using very limited unlabelled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognizers perform best in specific environments and adapting them to new conditions with limited unlabelled data is challenging.

Method: The method uses conditional entropy over complete hypotheses instead of cross-entropy on single hypotheses and introduces speaker codes to characterize speakers with short vectors.

Result: On a modified Common Voice dataset, the method showed a 20% relative improvement in word error rate with one minute of adaptation data and increased to 29% with ten minutes.

Conclusion: This approach significantly improves robustness of speech recognizer adaptation to new speakers using minimal unlabelled data.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Motivation: To explore and demonstrate the relationship and potential encoding between two different types of calculi.

Method: Defining an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value lambda-calculus in the pi-calculus and proving its soundness and completeness.

Result: The encoding is sound and complete, coinciding with early-, late- and open-bisimulation, which is a congruence.

Conclusion: The encoding meets Gorlas criteria for good encodings and shows similarities with Milners encoding.

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

Result: Highlights key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges in discrete audio tokenizers.

Conclusion: Provides insight and guidance for future research in this area.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,

TL;DR: Integrating audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs) has seen significant progress, but the underlying mechanisms for efficient transfer of semantic representations remain unclear. This paper investigates how architectural design choices affect the interaction between audio encoders and LLMs. The study proposes modifications to enhance the LLM's ability to probe audio representations, demonstrating improvements over the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs.

Method: Systematic investigation on architectural design choices, proposing modifications guided by mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. Experiments conducted on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs.

Result: Proposed modifications improve the LLM's ability to probe audio representations, achieving relative improvements from 10% to 60% over the baseline.

Conclusion: Our approach optimizes cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs, validating the effectiveness of proposed modifications.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress, limitations, and open challenges in keyphrase generation.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal

Result: 本文提出了一个动态适应其推理行为的模型概念，以适应新的专业、人群、工作流程和临床角色。

Conclusion: 提出了一种动态适应医疗保健中不断变化的环境的上下文切换AI模型的愿景。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the full range of MLLMs' scientific cognitive abilities beyond just knowledge understanding.

Method: Introducing the Scientists' First Exam (SFE), which includes 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types and 66 multimodal tasks in five disciplines.

Result: State-of-the-art models like GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 scored only 34.08% and 26.52% respectively on SFE, showing significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: The SFE benchmark provides valuable insights into enhancing MLLMs for more effective AI-supported scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Method: This paper introduces TeleMath, which includes a proposed QnAs generation pipeline starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts.

Result: The evaluation of open-source LLMs shows that recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning perform best on TeleMath, while general-purpose models struggle with these challenges.

Conclusion: TeleMath is the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs' performance in solving mathematical problems in the telecommunications domain. It comprises 500 QnA pairs covering various topics in the telecommunications field.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Conclusion: 尽管当前的多模态大型语言模型在分子毒性修复任务上仍面临重大挑战，但它们开始展示出对毒性理解、语义约束遵守和结构感知分子编辑的有希望的能力。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CIDer, a novel robust framework for Multimodal Emotion Recognition that addresses modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution data simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods often rely on specific models or introduce excessive parameters, limiting their practicality.

Method: CIDer includes MSSD and MACI modules. MSSD uses weight-sharing self-distillation across low-level features, attention maps, and high-level representations, while MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate label and language biases using MCM and fine-grained counterfactual texts.

Result: CIDer shows robust performance in RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIDer provides an effective solution for MER problems with modality missing and OOD data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频理解（LVU）任务对于当前多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）来说是一个重大挑战，因为该任务固有的复杂性和上下文窗口约束。通常认为解决LVU任务需要扩展上下文窗口、强大的视觉感知能力和熟练的专业知识的基础MLLMs。

Method: 引入了VideoDeepResearch，这是一种新的主动框架用于长视频理解。这种方法仅依赖于纯文本的大型推理模型（LRM）以及模块化的多模态工具包，包括多模态检索器和视觉感知器，这些在实践中已经广泛可用。系统通过推理为每个LVU任务制定问题解决策略，并选择性地访问和利用必要的视频内容。

Result: 在流行的LVU基准测试上进行了广泛的实验，包括MLVU、Video-MME和LVBench。结果显示，VideoDeepResearch在MLVU（测试）、LVBench和LongVideoBench上分别比现有的MLLM基线提高了9.6%、6.6%和3.9%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，主动系统在克服LVU问题的关键挑战方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an in-context image editing model without relying on task-specific pipelines and expert models by leveraging videos.

Method: A block-causal diffusion transformer is trained on three proxy tasks using annotated videos as interleaved multimodal sequences.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: Learning in-context image editing from videos is feasible and opens up opportunities for multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces knowledge image generation as a new task and a benchmark (MMMG) to assess the reasoning abilities of image generation models, finding current models lack sufficient reasoning capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the reasoning capabilities of image generation models using knowledge images which are important for human civilization and learning.

Method: The method involves introducing a new task called knowledge image generation and a benchmark named MMMG for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models.

Result: The results show that even top models like GPT-4o perform poorly on the MMMG benchmark with a score of only 50.20, indicating the difficulty of the benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current text-to-image generation models show significant reasoning deficits when generating knowledge images.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Result: Experiments show that RAAI can effectively 'jailbreak' LLMs, increasing the harmful response rate significantly. Fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: This work shows how LLM attack methodologies can be transformed into practical tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

TL;DR: Prevent private data leakage in Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in LLMs could lead to privacy violations.

Method: Introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), which detects and mitigates PII memorization by editing a model's knowledge of its training data.

Result: PME reduces the number of leaked PII in various configurations and can completely neutralize privacy attacks in some cases.

Conclusion: The approach transforms the LLMs' memorization ability into a privacy defense strategy without affecting the model's performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

Motivation: To examine the cybersecurity challenges brought by LLMs and compare the security levels of ChatGPT and Gemini.

Method: Comparative analysis and taxonomy of jailbreak techniques with experiments.

Result: Identified and compared the security and alignment levels of ChatGPT and Gemini.

Conclusion: LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini bring transformative changes but also new cybersecurity challenges that need to be addressed.

### [80] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Introducing GenBreak, a framework to evaluate the safety of defended text-to-image models by creating adversarial prompts that enhance evasion and toxicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of text-to-image models leads to misuse and safety risks. Current content moderation systems and research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks have limitations.

Method: Proposing GenBreak, a framework that fine-tunes a red-team large language model to explore vulnerabilities in text-to-image generators. This approach uses supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets and reinforcement learning via interaction with a surrogate model, guiding the LLM to create adversarial prompts that improve both evasion and image toxicity.

Result: GenBreak demonstrates strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against commercial text-to-image generators, uncovering practical and concerning safety weaknesses.

Conclusion: GenBreak addresses the lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety of defended text-to-image models, providing a method to systematically explore underlying vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为个人助理、客户服务机器人和临床助手的应用虽然带来了显著的操作优势，但需要持续访问敏感数据，增加了未经授权披露的风险。因此，需要一种方法来量化和审计这些风险。

Method: 提出了一种名为CMPL的迭代探测策略，设计用于压力测试严格执行隐私指令的代理。CMPL通过模拟现实中的多轮交互来系统地揭示潜在的漏洞。

Result: 在不同领域、数据模态和安全配置上的评估表明，审计框架能够揭示现有单轮防御无法阻止的隐私风险。

Conclusion: 这项研究引入了CMPL作为一种诊断工具，并提供了基于可量化风险指标的审计程序和一个开放基准，用于评估不同代理实现的对话隐私。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Some machine unlearning methods can fail under prompt attacks. We tested eight unlearning techniques and found that while some are robust, others like ELM are still vulnerable. Our analysis suggests that unlearned models aren't concealing knowledge by changing answer formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of different machine unlearning methods against prompt attacks.

Method: Systematically evaluating eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analyses.

Result: Methods such as RMU and TAR show robust unlearning, but ELM remains vulnerable to certain prompt attacks. Unlearned models do not hide knowledge by altering answer formatting.

Conclusion: The study challenges assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and emphasizes the need for reliable evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO improves reinforcement learning from human feedback by optimizing based on both preference pair quality and model learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO-based approaches overlook variations in preference pair quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Omni-DPO uses a dual-perspective optimization framework that adaptively weights samples based on data quality and model learning dynamics.

Result: Omni-DPO shows superior performance across various models and benchmarks, beating leading models like Claude 3 Opus.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances data utilization and achieves better performance in reinforcement learning from human feedback.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

TL;DR: We propose using meta-learning to detect malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia, which improves prediction precision over pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving reliable information and preventing disinformation on the internet by detecting sockpuppets effectively, especially in data-scarce situations.

Method: Applying meta-learning to optimize model's ability to adapt quickly to new sockpuppet writing styles.

Result: Meta-learning shows significant improvement in prediction precision compared to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Our approach marks progress in fighting sockpuppetry on open editing platforms and provides a new dataset to support further research.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper formalizes the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, introduces 'transfer eluder dimension' to measure problem complexity, shows cases where language feedback can speed up learning exponentially compared to reward-based learning, develops a no-regret algorithm called HELiX for solving LLF problems, and demonstrates its effectiveness across several empirical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing study of interactively learning from observation and language feedback due to the rise of large language model agents, while there lacks a principled framing of these decision problems.

Method: Formalizing the LLF problem, introducing 'transfer eluder dimension' as a complexity measure, developing a no-regret algorithm named HELiX, and conducting experiments across several empirical domains.

Result: Demonstrates cases where learning from rich language feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. Shows that HELiX performs well even when prompting LLMs does not work reliably.

Conclusion: This work marks a first step towards designing principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Result: 对多种预训练的LLMs进行的经验评估显示，所提出的攻击方法是成功的，揭示了LLMs存在属性推理的漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了LLMs在处理敏感数据时的安全隐患，为未来的研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is important for actionable insights to inform model development. However, rigorous causal evaluations face methodological challenges including complex confounding effects and high computational costs.

Method: A causal representation learning framework was proposed, modeling observed benchmark performance as a linear transformation of latent capability factors, identifying latent factors as causally interrelated after controlling for the base model as a common confounder.

Result: A concise three-node linear causal structure was found to explain observed performance variations. This structure provides scientific insights beyond numerical rankings.

Conclusion: The study reveals a causal relationship starting from general problem-solving capabilities, going through instruction-following proficiency, and ending at mathematical reasoning ability.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Result: 实证结果显示，在不规则时间序列数据上显式建模多模态可以显著提高预测性能。

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为在真实条件下推进时间序列分析提供了基础。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-stage pipeline that uses a U-Net based segmentation network to handle single leads compromised by signal overlaps in digitizing paper-based electrocardiogram recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methodologies often fail to address the issue of signal overlaps in digitizing ECG recordings.

Method: A two-stage pipeline including a U-Net based segmentation network and a digitization technique with an adaptive grid detection module.

Result: The method achieved superior performance in both non-overlapping and overlapping ECG samples compared to a baseline technique.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective solution to improve the accuracy of digitizing ECG records, especially when dealing with signal overlaps.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Motivation: Automated question answering over electronic health records can bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, but it requires both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited supervision.

Method: We decouple the task into sentence-level evidence identification and answer synthesis with explicit citations. We use DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer to explore the prompt space and jointly tune instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A self-consistency voting scheme further enhances evidence recall.

Result: On the hidden test set, our method achieves an overall score of 51.5, surpassing standard zero-shot and few-shot prompting approaches.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can

sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and

TL;DR: This paper introduces Duo, a method that improves uniform-state discrete diffusion models for text generation by borrowing techniques from Gaussian diffusion, including a curriculum learning strategy and Discrete Consistency Distillation, resulting in faster training and sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the performance gap between uniform-state diffusion models and autoregressive or masked diffusion models in text generation.

Method: Duo transfers techniques from Gaussian diffusion, using a curriculum learning strategy based on the Gaussian process to enhance training and Discrete Consistency Distillation to accelerate sampling.

Result: Models trained with Duo's curriculum learning outperform autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks and Duo enables few-step generation by speeding up sampling by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The Duo method successfully leverages Gaussian diffusion techniques to enhance uniform-state discrete diffusion models, achieving superior performance in text generation tasks.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

Result: Realistic context increases racial and gender biases in various models; race and gender-correlated directions are identified and mitigated with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: Internal bias mitigation is effective in reducing biases in LLMs for hiring applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: This paper proposes GUARD, a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution in large language models. It introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric and a novel unlearning objective to improve utility preservation during unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns make unlearning in large language models important, but unintended forgetting is a challenge.

Method: GUARD uses a lightweight proxy data attribution metric and an adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weight assignment to mitigate unintended losses in retention.

Result: GUARD improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning, reducing utility sacrifice by up to 194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Conclusion: GUARD provides significant enhancement in retention for large language models during unlearning.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

### [94] [Build the web for agents, not agents for the web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10953)
*Xing Han Lù,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This position paper argues for a new interaction paradigm called Agentic Web Interface (AWI), specifically designed for autonomous AI agents to navigate websites, addressing limitations of current human-designed interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agent approaches struggle with human-designed interfaces due to mismatches in complexity and capabilities.

Method: Introduce the concept of Agentic Web Interface (AWI) and establish six guiding principles for its design.

Result: Proposes a paradigm shift in web agent research by designing interfaces optimized for agents rather than humans, aiming to improve efficiency, reliability, and transparency.

Conclusion: The development of AWIs is essential for advancing web agent capabilities and requires collaboration within the broader ML community.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

### [95] [FASCIST-O-METER: Classifier for Neo-fascist Discourse Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10789)
*Rudy Alexandro Garrido Veliz,Martin Semmann,Chris Biemann,Seid Muhie Yimam*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel coding scheme for identifying neo-fascist discourse in US digital contexts, bridging NLP and political science. It uses crowdsourced annotations on posts from neo-fascist forums, fine-tuning language models to classify such content, revealing the persistent presence of neo-fascist rhetoric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing threat of neo-fascism to democracy and minority groups by developing a method to detect neo-fascist discourse using NLP techniques.

Method: Developing a neo-fascist coding scheme, collecting internet activity from neo-fascist forums, annotating posts through crowdsourcing, and fine-tuning both small and large language models for classification.

Result: The prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric is found to be significant in targeted forums, leading to the creation of the first classification models for neo-fascist discourse.

Conclusion: Active efforts are necessary to combat neo-fascism, and societal context is crucial in NLP research focusing on this political movement.

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.
