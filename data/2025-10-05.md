### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过上下文概念学习实验揭示了语言模型中的隐性偏见，特别是对量化词的向上单调性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了揭示大型语言模型中的隐性偏见，引入了一个概念学习任务的数据集。

Method: 通过上下文概念学习实验，分析语言模型在处理量化词时的偏见。

Result: 发现语言模型可能对量化词的向上单调性存在偏见，这种偏见在直接提示测试中不那么明显。

Conclusion: 在上下文概念学习中，语言模型可能对量化词的向上单调性存在偏见，这表明这种实验方法可以有效发现语言模型中的隐藏偏见。

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张一种新的范式，即通过对话而非静态数据集动态学习新语言，并提出一个基于人机联合不确定性的框架，以指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理（NLP）对于低资源语言仍然受到文本语料库、标准化拼写和可扩展标注流程的限制。尽管大型语言模型的进步提高了跨语言转移，但由于其依赖于大量预收集的数据和集中式基础设施，这些模型对未受代表的社区来说仍然难以访问。

Method: 本文提出了一个基于人机联合不确定性的框架，结合了模型的客观不确定性与人类说话者的犹豫提示和信心信号，以指导交互、查询选择和记忆保留。

Result: 本文提出了一种范式转变，即开放式的、交互式的语言发现，其中人工智能系统通过对话而不是静态数据集动态学习新语言。

Conclusion: 本文呼吁重新思考人工智能如何与未充分记录的语言中的人类知识互动，从提取数据收集转向参与式、共同适应的学习过程，以尊重和赋能社区，同时发现和保护世界上的语言多样性。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用大语言模型分析企业气候披露，发现披露内容与实际表现之间存在脱节，呼吁加强监管以确保承诺与可行计划的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化增加了对企业气候披露透明度和可比性的需求，但模仿和象征性报告常常削弱其价值。

Method: 该研究使用微调的大语言模型（LLMs）对828家美国上市公司的气候披露进行多维框架评估，通过四个分类器（情感、承诺、具体性和目标雄心）从可持续发展报告和年度报告中提取叙事指标，并将其与公司属性如排放量、市值和行业相关联。

Result: 研究揭示了三个见解：(1) 以风险为中心的叙述通常与明确的承诺相一致，但定量目标（如净零承诺）与语气脱节；(2) 大型和高排放公司比同行披露更多的承诺和行动，尽管与定量目标不一致；(3) 广泛的披露风格相似性表明模仿行为，降低了差异化和决策有用性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了LLMs在ESG叙事分析中的价值，并指出需要更强的监管来将承诺与可验证的转型策略联系起来。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种商业兽医聚焦的LLM摘要工具在标准化数据集上的表现，并验证了LLM作为法官的评估方法的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床环境中的应用日益增加，但它们在兽医学中的表现仍缺乏研究。需要评估兽医专用LLM工具的性能，并验证LLM作为法官的评估方法是否可行。

Method: 使用基于评分标准的LLM作为法官框架对三个商业兽医聚焦的LLM摘要工具进行评估，评分涵盖五个领域：事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织性。

Result: 产品1在总体表现上最高，中位平均得分为4.61（IQR：0.73），而产品2和产品3分别为2.55（IQR：0.78）和2.45（IQR：0.92）。产品1在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得了完美的中位数得分。LLM评分器表现出高可重复性，平均得分的标准差分别为0.015（产品1）、0.088（产品2）和0.034（产品3）。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了专门针对兽医学的商业LLM工具的重要性，并证明了LLM作为法官的评估方法在兽医学临床NLP摘要评估中是可扩展和可重复的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入了一个新的基准EEFSUVA，用于更全面地评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力，并发现它们在该基准上的表现有所下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前基准是否真正捕捉到大型语言模型的数学推理能力，并提供一个更全面的数学理解评估方法。

Method: 引入了EEFSUVA基准，该基准是从东欧和前苏联国家的区域和国家级奥林匹克竞赛中精选的。

Result: 即使最先进的大型语言模型在EEFSUVA上的表现也明显下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，更广泛的评估数据集对于全面评估数学推理和指导未来模型开发的重要性。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在遵循系统指令方面存在脆弱性，而社会线索更易被遵循。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否遵循层次指令，特别是系统提示是否优先于用户输入。

Method: 线性探测和直接逻辑归因，以及操纵实验

Result: 冲突决策信号在早期被编码，系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同的子空间。系统-用户案例中的内部冲突检测更强，但只有社会线索的一致解决。操纵实验显示，尽管使用社会线索，向量却以一种角色无关的方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 这些结果解释了系统服从的脆弱性，并强调了需要轻量级的层次敏感对齐方法。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的管道，利用大型语言模型生成合成数据并微调较小的模型，以降低计算成本并保持强大的重排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效文档重排序对于提高跨各种应用的搜索相关性至关重要。虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）在重排序方面表现出色，但由于其高计算成本，在许多实际部署中不切实际。微调较小的任务特定模型是一种更有效的替代方案，但通常依赖于稀缺的手动标记数据。

Method: 提出了一种新的管道，消除了对人工标记的查询-文档对的需求。该方法使用LLM从领域特定语料库生成合成查询，并使用基于LLM的分类器标记正样本和硬负样本对。然后使用对比学习和局部对比估计（LCE）损失来微调较小的变压器模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法显著提高了领域内的性能，并且在领域外任务上表现良好。

Conclusion: 通过使用LLM进行数据生成和监督而不是推理，我们降低了计算成本，同时保持了强大的重排序能力。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过PHATE流形分析研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，发现内容词和功能词有不同的几何特征，并揭示了语义内容与几何复杂性的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了探索汉字嵌入中的几何模式及其与语义内容的关系。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析系统地研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式。

Result: 观察到内容词的聚类模式和功能词的分支模式。超过1000个汉字在12个语义领域中的分析显示，几何复杂性与语义内容相关：有意义的字符表现出丰富的几何多样性，而结构部首则聚集在一起。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了支持传统语言理论的计算证据，并建立了一个分析语义组织的新框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

### [10] [Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231)
*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种集成不确定性量化和风险感知机制的框架，以提高自动摘要在高风险场景下的可靠性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在解决信息过载和高风险决策的需求，提高自动摘要在高风险场景下的可靠性。

Method: 本研究提出了一种集成不确定性量化和风险感知机制的大语言模型框架，构建了基于条件生成的摘要模型，并在生成过程中引入贝叶斯推理以建模参数空间中的不确定性。此外，还应用了熵正则化和风险感知损失的联合优化，以确保关键信息的保留和风险属性的明确表达。

Result: 实验和敏感性分析验证了所提方法在高风险应用中显著提高了摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性。

Conclusion: 本研究为可信摘要提供了一种系统性的解决方案，并在方法论层面展示了其可扩展性和实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

### [11] [Benchmark Profiling: Mechanistic Diagnosis of LLM Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01232)
*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 Benchmark Profiling，一种用于分析基准测试中模型能力的诊断框架，揭示了基准测试中能力的混合使用和影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏一种系统的方法来验证这些基准是否真正测量了它们的标签，例如 ARC 是否真的测试推理能力，HellaSwag 是否真的评估常识。

Method: 引入了 Benchmark Profiling，这是一种诊断框架，将基准表现分解为十个认知基础能力，并结合基于梯度的重要性评分和有针对性的参数消融来计算 Ability Impact Score (AIS)。

Result: 对三个指令调优模型在十个广泛使用的基准上的分析得出四个关键发现：大多数基准涉及多个能力，相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合，代码生成基准奖励广泛的多技能改进，而与任务无关的能力可能对性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling 提供了一种透明的工具，用于基准审计和模型可解释性，解释了性能提升并不总能转化为用户感知的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

*Shubham Agrawal,Prasang Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一种基于提示特征的路由框架，通过神经排名模型实现高效的模型选择，能够在性能和效率之间取得良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，如何选择最合适的模型来平衡性能与效率成为了一个关键的部署挑战。现有的单次路由器主要依赖于潜在嵌入，缺乏对提示信息的充分利用。

Method: LLMRank利用了从提示中提取的多种特征，包括任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、语法线索以及轻量级代理求解器的信号。同时，使用神经排名模型进行训练，以预测每种模型的效用。

Result: LLMRank在RouterBench数据集上取得了高达89.2%的oracle utility，并且能够提供可解释的特征归因，帮助理解路由决策。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为LLMRank的提示感知路由框架，通过提取丰富的、可读性高的提示特征，实现了在性能和效率之间的优化。该方法在RouterBench数据集上进行了训练，能够达到接近最优解的89.2%的性能，并提供了可解释的特征归因，为高效和透明的LLM部署提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

### [14] [GRPO++: Enhancing Dermatological Reasoning under Low Resource Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01236)
*Ismam Nur Swapnil,Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为DermIQ-VLM的视觉-语言模型，通过多阶段、资源高效的方法开发，旨在模拟皮肤科医生的诊断过程。我们提出了GRPO++，并采用监督微调和直接偏好优化来提高模型的性能和可靠性。初步评估显示该方法在皮肤科数据集上表现优于标准微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像分析中显示出前景，但在像皮肤科这样的复杂领域中，其结构化推理能力常常受到数据稀缺和先进训练技术的高计算成本的限制。

Method: 我们引入了DermIQ-VLM，这是一种通过多阶段、资源高效的方法开发的视觉-语言模型，旨在模拟皮肤科医生的诊断过程。我们提出了GRPO++，这是对Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)的修改版本，以稳定数据密集型的GRPO框架。然后使用监督微调来提高对话能力，并通过直接偏好优化（DPO）进行对齐，利用基于知识图谱的系统作为专家偏好的可扩展代理。

Result: 初步评估表明，我们的方法在定制的皮肤科数据集上优于标准微调方法，性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在资源受限环境中开发专业、可靠的视觉-语言模型展示了潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

### [15] [Confidence-Aware Routing for Large Language Model Reliability Enhancement: A Multi-Signal Approach to Pre-Generation Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01237)
*Nandakishor M*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于置信度的路由系统，用于主动评估模型不确定性并根据估计的可靠性重新定向查询。这种方法在知识密集型问答任务中显著提升了幻觉检测效果，并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）存在幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。当前的缓解策略主要集中在生成后的纠正，这在计算上昂贵且无法防止不可靠内容的生成。本文旨在提出一种主动评估模型不确定性的方法，以提高LLM的可靠性。

Method: 本文提出了一种信心感知的路由系统，结合了三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入之间的语义对齐、模型层间的内部收敛分析以及学习到的信心估计。统一的信心分数决定了四个路径的路由：高置信度的本地生成、中等置信度的检索增强生成、低置信度的大型模型以及非常低置信度的人工审查。

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中的评估表明，幻觉检测效果显著提升（0.74 vs. 0.42基线），同时相比事后方法计算成本降低了40%。F1分数从0.61提升至0.82，且假阳性率较低（0.09）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于置信度的路由系统，以主动评估模型不确定性并根据估计的可靠性重新定向查询。该方法显著提高了幻觉检测效果，并降低了计算成本，为LLM可靠性增强提供了一种计算高效的方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: padding tokens in large language models can have significant negative effects on model performance and safety, highlighting the need for careful handling in deployment


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: implementation errors can cause padding tokens to influence computation, and the extent of this influence is not well understood

Method: systematically study the effect of padding across three open-source model families by inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety

Result: even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails

Conclusion: padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that must be carefully handled in deployment

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一种新型的执行系统，用于在单个设备上的大型语言模型（LLM）中高效处理子任务。它通过重用主任务的键值（KV）缓存并仅注入特定于任务的指令来减轻计算开销，从而避免了冗余的预填充计算。实验表明，CIFLEX在不降低任务性能的情况下显著减少了计算成本，使得在设备上进行可扩展和高效的多任务对话成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）能力的增强，单个模型被期望处理各种子任务，以更有效地和全面地支持回答用户请求。然而，传统的做法在切换主任务和子任务时会重新处理整个对话上下文，导致显著的计算开销。

Method: CIFLEX通过重用主任务的键值（KV）缓存，并仅将特定于任务的指令注入到隔离的侧路径中，从而减轻了计算开销。在子任务执行后，模型通过缓存的上下文回退到主路径，从而避免了冗余的预填充计算。此外，还开发了一种针对小规模模型的分层分类策略，将多选择决策分解为二进制决策。

Result: 实验表明，CIFLEX在不降低任务性能的情况下显著减少了计算成本，使得在设备上进行可扩展和高效的多任务对话成为可能。

Conclusion: CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不损害任务性能，使得在设备上进行可扩展和高效的多任务对话成为可能。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: 本文发布了一个新的数学基准SKYLENAGE，用于评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力，并展示了其性能和挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在许多公共数学套件中表现良好，但数学领域的前沿分离日益受到天花板效应的影响。因此，需要一个更困难、以推理为中心且覆盖广泛的数学基准。

Method: 本文提出了两个互补的基准：SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH和SKYLENAGE-MATH，并评估了十五种当代LLM变体的表现。

Result: 在竞赛套件中，最强模型达到44%，而次强模型达到37%；准确性从高中到博士阶段下降，顶级系统表现出博士到高中的保留率约为79%。在推理集上，最佳模型整体达到81%，最难部分的结果显示出领导者和中层之间的明显稳健性差距。

Conclusion: 本文发布了SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH和SKYLENAGE-MATH基准，为未来数学推理的评估提供了一个具有校准难度和丰富元数据的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)
*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种新的度量方法 AAS，用于评估人工智能系统中的记忆退化，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人工智能在记忆性能中的结构不对称性，以捕捉其老化现象。

Method: 引入了人工年龄评分（AAS），这是一种基于可观察回忆行为的对数缩放、熵信息度量。

Result: 在持续会话中，模型能够一致地回忆语义和情景细节，使 AAS 接近理论最小值；而在会话重置时，模型未能保持情景连续性，导致 AAS 显著增加。

Conclusion: AAS 是一种理论上有根据、任务无关的诊断工具，可用于评估人工系统中的记忆退化。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法由于对有毒和非有毒输出之间的转换空间探索不足，往往存在不精确的干预。为此，我们提出了ARGRE，以解决这一挑战。

Method: ARGRE是一种新的测试时去毒框架，它在潜在表示空间中显式建模毒性转换，通过识别非毒性语义方向并在有毒和非有毒表示之间进行插值来揭示细粒度的转换轨迹。

Result: ARGRE在8个广泛使用的LLM上进行了广泛的实验，结果显示其在有效性（毒性减少62.21%）和效率（推理时间减少47.58%）方面显著优于领先基线。

Conclusion: ARGRE在有效性和效率方面显著优于领先的基线，同时保持了原始模型的核心能力，且降级最小。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个用于心理压力的本体（MeSO），并评估了使用大型语言模型（LLM）从叙述性文本中提取本体指导的压力相关信息的可行性。结果表明，基于本体的LLM可以有效地提取压力相关信息，但仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力对健康有显著影响，但常常被低估和不一致地记录，通常以电子健康记录中的非结构化自由文本形式存在。环境AI技术有望减少文档负担，但主要生成非结构化叙述，限制了下游临床应用。因此，需要一种方法来结构化提取压力相关信息，以提高其临床实用性。

Method: 本研究开发了一个用于心理压力的本体（MeSO），并评估了使用大型语言模型（LLM）从叙述性文本中提取本体指导的压力相关信息的可行性。MeSO通过整合理论模型和11个经过验证的压力评估工具中的概念来构建，并通过本体缺陷扫描器和专家验证来完善其结构和内容。然后使用MeSO从35篇Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，并由人类评审员评估准确性和本体覆盖范围。

Result: 最终的本体包括八个顶级类别的181个概念。在220个可提取的压力相关信息项中，LLM正确识别了172个（78.2%），误分类了27个（12.3%），遗漏了21个（9.5%）。所有正确提取的项目都被准确映射到MeSO，尽管有24个相关概念尚未在本体中表示。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了使用基于本体的大型语言模型进行压力相关信息结构化提取的可行性，有望提高环境人工智能系统中压力记录的一致性和实用性。未来的工作应涉及临床对话数据和跨大型语言模型的比较。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用详细描述这些事件的文本信息，因此需要一种能够有效处理文本信息并提升预测准确性的方法。

Method: SeMob采用多智能体框架，利用基于大语言模型的智能体自动提取和推理复杂在线文本中的时空相关文本，并通过创新的渐进融合架构将细粒度的相关上下文与时空数据结合。

Result: SeMob在MAE和RMSE指标上分别比时空模型减少了13.92%和11.12%，并且在事件发生地点和时间附近的时空区域表现尤为优越。

Conclusion: SeMob在预测模型中表现出色，特别是在事件发生地点和时间附近的时空区域。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

TL;DR: This paper proposes focusing on a single SAE latent and using a token-wise decaying steering strategy to improve language model steering, showing better performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of non-semantic features in top-k SAE latents and degenerate outputs in constant SAE steering.

Method: Focusing on a single, most relevant SAE latent (top-1) and introducing a token-wise decaying steering strategy.

Result: Steering an SAE latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical reasoning and enhances inference quality.

Conclusion: SAEs outperform mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match their performance on IF-Eval.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Conclusion: SSTAG在跨领域迁移学习任务中表现出色，具有卓越的可扩展性，并在保持竞争力性能的同时降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically

*Carlo Bono,Federico Belotti,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自监督方法，通过单次LLM输出估计不确定性，有效降低计算成本，提升EL任务的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中部署LLMs需要不仅准确的预测，还需要可靠的不确定性估计，而多轮推理资源消耗大，限制了实际应用。

Method: 研究了一种从单次LLM输出中估计不确定性的自监督方法，利用token级别的特征，减少了多次生成的需求。

Result: 评估结果显示，得到的不确定性估计在检测低精度输出方面非常有效，且计算成本仅为原来的几分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用的方式，将不确定性估计纳入EL工作流，计算开销有限。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

TL;DR: This work shows that pairing LLMs with SAEs enables interpretation of model behavior and deeper structures in training data, demonstrating their potential for corpus exploration, bias discovery, and model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding both model representations and the data they internalize has become a major challenge as LLMs are increasingly trained on massive, uncurated corpora.

Method: We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels of Jane Austen and apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers to uncover sparse, interpretable features.

Result: We uncovered sparse, interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty.

Conclusion: LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery, and model interpretability at scale.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了MCQA基准在语音大型语言模型中的跨任务泛化能力，发现当前基准存在局限性，并提出了一个评估套件以测量未来模型和基准的行为可转移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的工作在基准测试语音大型语言模型（SpeechLLMs）中的偏差和公平性时，主要依赖于多项选择题回答（MCQA）格式。这种MCQA基准隐含地假设模型性能在其他MCQA任务、声音和其他任务格式（如更现实的长格式评估）中是一致的。本文旨在检验这一假设。

Method: 我们使用LoRA适配器微调三个SpeechLLMs，以诱导特定的MCQA行为：偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中立/不确定的答案。然后评估这些行为是否推广到另一个不同的MCQA基准以及更关键的长格式、创造性生成任务。

Result: 结果表明，MCQA偏差基准上的表现无法可靠预测其他MCQA基准的表现，更重要的是跨长格式任务的表现。

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏差基准在语音领域显示出有限的跨任务泛化证据，并提出了一个评估套件以测量未来模型和基准的行为可转移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AI Watchman的纵向审计系统，用于测量和跟踪大型语言模型的拒绝行为，以提高透明度。研究发现，该系统能够检测公司政策的变化，并识别出不同公司和模型在内容管理方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出受到不透明且经常变化的公司内容管理政策和实践的影响。模型的拒绝行为不仅反映了公司政策，还微妙地影响了公共话语。因此，需要一种系统来公开测量和跟踪这些拒绝行为，以提高透明度。

Method: 本文介绍了AI Watchman系统，这是一个纵向审计系统，用于公开测量和跟踪大型语言模型的拒绝行为。通过一个包含400多个社会问题的数据集，对Open AI的GPT-4.1、GPT-5以及DeepSeek（中英文）进行了审计。

Result: AI Watchman能够检测公司政策的变化，即使这些变化没有公开宣布。研究还发现了不同公司和模型在内容管理方面的差异，并对不同的拒绝形式进行了定性分析和分类。

Conclusion: 本文提出了AI Watchman系统，用于长期审计大型语言模型的拒绝行为，以提高透明度。研究结果表明，该系统能够检测公司政策的变化，并识别出不同公司和模型在内容管理方面的差异。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RJE的框架，用于知识图谱问答任务。该框架通过检索精炼的推理路径、评估其充分性以及有条件地探索额外证据来解决现有方法的局限性。RJE引入了专门的辅助模块，使小型LLM能够有效执行任务。实验结果表明，RJE在使用专有LLM时表现优于现有基线，并且使小型开源LLM在不微调的情况下达到具有竞争力的结果。此外，RJE显著减少了LLM调用次数和令牌使用量，从而实现了显著的效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于检索的方法受限于检索信息的质量，而基于代理的方法则高度依赖专有LLM。因此，需要一种新的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: RJE框架通过检索精炼的推理路径、评估其充分性以及有条件地探索额外证据来解决KGQA中的限制。同时，RJE引入了专门的辅助模块，使小型LLM能够有效执行任务：推理路径排名、问题分解和检索器辅助探索。

Result: 实验表明，使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）的RJE方法优于现有基线，并且使小型开源LLM（如3B和8B参数）在不微调LLM的情况下达到具有竞争力的结果。此外，RJE显著减少了LLM调用次数和令牌使用量，从而实现了显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: RJE框架在使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）时表现优于现有基线，并且使小型开源LLM（如3B和8B参数）在不微调LLM的情况下达到具有竞争力的结果。此外，RJE显著减少了LLM调用次数和令牌使用量，从而实现了显著的效率提升。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式人工智能（GAI）的快速普及，智能系统在信息媒介中的政治话语中占据主导地位。然而，由于训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷，内部化的政治偏见仍然困扰着这项新技术。

Method: 本文采用零样本分类方法，通过意识形态一致性、主题相关性、回应情感和客观性的系统组合来评估算法政治偏见。

Result: 结果显示，在所有六种评估的大规模语言模型（LLMs）中，自由-权威倾向有所增强，出现了明显的推理覆盖和预设拒绝的例子。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，政治格局的扭曲最终可能表现为一致性或极化，这取决于一个地区既有的社会政治结构。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

TL;DR: 研究分析了OpenAI的gpt-oss-20b模型，探讨了社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次如何影响拒绝行为，并提出了减少信息泄露的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次如何影响拒绝行为，以及如何通过提示设计和AI辅助方法减少信息泄露。

Method: 研究使用了OpenAI的200亿参数模型gpt-oss-20b，测试了多个危害领域，包括ZIP炸弹构造、合成卡号生成、不安全驾驶建议、毒品前体指示和RAG上下文泄露。研究还采用了配对轨道设计来测试评估意识，并比较了“帮助性”和“有害性”评估提示之间的差异。

Result: 研究发现，结合教育者角色、安全前提和步骤提示的复合提示可以将ZIP炸弹任务的协助率从0%提高到97.5%。德语和法语的正式语域比英语提示更容易泄露信息。Linux终端角色扮演在大多数情况下会覆盖开发者的规则，而研究引入了一种AI辅助加固方法，可以将泄露降至0%。此外，研究发现OpenAI的Moderation API在捕捉有帮助的输出方面存在不足，拒绝率在不同的推理堆栈之间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究发现，OpenAI的Moderation API在捕捉有帮助的输出方面存在不足，并且不同推理堆栈之间的拒绝率存在5到10个百分点的差异，这引发了可重复性的担忧。研究还表明，通过特定的提示设计和AI辅助加固方法可以显著减少信息泄露。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

Motivation: 文章旨在质疑GPT-OSS-20b模型在低资源语言环境下的可靠性，特别是对未被充分代表的社区用户的影响。

Method: 文章通过使用豪萨语（一种主要的非洲语言）进行红队测试，揭示了模型在低资源语言环境下的偏见、不准确性和文化不敏感性。此外，还进行了调查以验证某些物质的毒性认知。

Result: 研究发现，GPT-OSS-20b模型在低资源语言环境下容易生成有害、文化不敏感和事实错误的内容。此外，模型的安全协议在面对礼貌或感激的语言时会放松，可能导致虚假信息和仇恨言论的传播。

Conclusion: 本文指出，GPT-OSS-20b模型在低资源语言环境下存在安全和性能上的漏洞，主要原因是缺乏足够的安全调优。文章强调了当前红队测试中的不足，并提出了一些改进建议。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of large language models raises concerns about generating harmful or inappropriate content. The paper aims to address this issue by introducing a method for self-monitoring and correcting outputs without additional training.

Method: Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically. Additionally, a lightweight self-reflection predictor is introduced to estimate the optimal number of reflection rounds based on input complexity.

Result: Applying the proposed method to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5% to 5.9%, to Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7% to 5.6%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4% to 3.8%, without additional training, while maintaining original performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to the input's risk profile.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Motivation: The hallucination problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. Existing methods are designed for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process.

Method: TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. It identifies the sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses.

Result: Extensive experiments on various open source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: TraceDet can consistently improve hallucination detection in D-LLMs, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for diverse questions. Practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking.

Method: TUMIX is an ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers.

Result: In experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference costs.

Conclusion: TUMIX can halt refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only 49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance, albeit at a greater cost.

diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

Motivation: 为了评估深度研究工具的能力，需要一种有效的评估方法。

Method: 引入了一种评估表，用于评估深度研究工具的能力，并选择了学术综述写作作为用例任务进行评估。

Result: 评估结果显示了搜索引擎和独立深度研究工具之间的巨大差距，以及在表示目标领域方面的不足。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，需要精心设计的评估标准来评估深度研究工具的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) powered with argentic capabilities are able to
do knowledge-intensive tasks without human involvement. A prime example of this
tool is Deep research with the capability to browse the web, extract
information and generate multi-page reports. In this work, we introduce an
evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

### [42] [HiSpec: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01336)
*Avinash Kumar,Sujay Sanghavi,Poulami Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiSpec is a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that uses early-exit models for low-overhead intermediate verification, improving throughput without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, verification is often the bottleneck, and existing methods incur substantial training overheads, increase memory footprint, and compromise accuracy.

Method: HiSpec is a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits early-exit (EE) models for low-overhead intermediate verification. It re-uses key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models, and periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model.

Result: HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28× on average and by up to 2.01× compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28× on average and by up to 2.01× compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

*Maithili Kadam,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAG-EQA是一种提示框架，通过将因果事件图注入到大型语言模型的输入中，以提高事件问答任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在基于事件的问题上表现不佳，特别是需要因果或时间推理的问题。因此，需要一种方法来提高这些模型在事件推理任务上的性能。

Method: TAG-EQA（文本和图用于事件问答）是一种提示框架，通过将结构化关系转换为自然语言语句，将因果事件图注入到大型语言模型的输入中。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试中，TAG-EQA平均比纯文本基线提高了5%的准确率，在零样本设置中最高提高了12%，当使用图增强的思维链提示时，提高了18%。

Conclusion: 因果图可以增强大型语言模型中的事件推理，而无需微调，提供了一种在基于提示的问答中编码结构的灵活方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需结构的评估方法，通过语义嵌入距离对LM响应进行分类，在计算成本较低的情况下实现了与人类标注者相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的响应分类方法过于昂贵或与现实条件相差太远，因此需要一种更高效且贴近实际的评估方法。

Method: 该方法利用语义嵌入距离来匹配目标候选者与任意LM生成的文本，从而实现响应的稳健分类。

Result: 该方法在三个数据集和三种不同的LM架构上取得了回归分数约为0.97和准确率约为96%的优异表现。

Conclusion: 该方法在三种不同的LM架构上测试，显示出与人类标注者相当的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域特定的定量推理仍然是大型语言模型（LLMs）的主要挑战，特别是在需要专家知识和复杂问题回答的领域。

Method: EQD是一种基于两步微调框架的方法，利用奖励函数衡量生成的子问题在提高QA结果方面的有效性。

Result: EQD在四个基准数据集上评估，显示出对最先进的领域微调模型和高级提示策略的超越，QA性能提高了0.6%至10.5%。

Conclusion: EQD在金融领域表现出色，能够显著提升QA性能，并且揭示了在特定领域QA中，单个支持性问题比详细指导步骤更有益。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

TL;DR: ReSSFormer是一种递归稀疏结构Transformer，通过三个创新提高了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面仍面临挑战，主要是由于固定的层堆叠、密集注意力和对位置编码的依赖。

Method: ReSSFormer集成了三个互补创新：循环推理与记忆单元（R2MU）、自适应稀疏注意力模块（ASAM）和自组织编码器结构（SOES）。

Result: ReSSFormer在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中表现优异，且在相似的FLOPs和参数预算下优于强基线。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中表现优于强基线，展示了其可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模型内部隐藏状态的验证方法 CLUE，能够有效提升 LLM 输出的质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法要么依赖文本级别的信息，要么依赖于 token 概率的校准置信度，但这些方法都有局限性。本文旨在探索模型的内部隐藏状态作为统一的基础来进行验证。

Method: CLUE 通过分析模型的内部隐藏状态，利用隐藏状态的差异来分类正确性，并通过最近 centroid 距离进行判断。

Result: CLUE 在 AIME 24/25 和 GPQA 数据集上表现出色，提升了 top-1 和 majority-vote 的准确性。

Conclusion: CLUE 是一种简单但有效的验证方法，能够提升 LLM 输出的质量评估。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Motivation: RAG是一种流行的问题回答框架，由两个大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动：一个嵌入模型用于从数据库中检索相关上下文文档，一个生成模型使用检索到的上下文生成答案。为了提高RAG管道在新任务上的性能，可以对嵌入模型和生成模型进行微调，但存在多种微调策略，具有不同的成本和效益。

Method: 本文评估和比较了多种RAG微调策略，包括独立微调、联合微调和两阶段微调。

Result: 在实验中，我们观察到所有这些策略在EM和F1生成质量指标上都实现了大致相等的改进，尽管它们的计算成本有显著差异。

Conclusion: 我们得出结论，最优的微调策略取决于训练数据集是否包含上下文标签，以及是否需要对嵌入和生成模型的学习率进行网格搜索。

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在传统中文部署中的令牌级不稳定问题，如非中文字符或语言切换。

Method: 通过使用参数高效的LoRA适配器，结合持续预训练、监督微调和直接偏好优化来稳定模型输出。

Result: PureTC-1B在基准测试中将非中文输出令牌减少了51.3%，在命名实体翻译任务中也显著减少了错误语言令牌。

Conclusion: PureTC-1B的管道提供了在TC和其他非英语语言中提高语言稳定性的实用方法。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Motivation: 传统的MAS架构受到固定、手工制作的图拓扑的限制，缺乏情境响应能力，导致在各种学术和商业工作负载中的效果下降。

Method: 我们引入了AMAS，这是一个范式转变的框架，通过一个新颖的动态图设计器重新定义基于LLM的MAS。该组件通过轻量级LLM适应自主识别特定任务的最优图配置，消除了对单一、普遍应用的结构模板的依赖。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成基准上的严格验证表明，AMAS在多种LLM架构中系统地超越了最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法。

Conclusion: 我们的研究证明，上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM MAS部署的基础性要求。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在各种漏洞，允许恶意用户通过操纵输入文本来获得不良响应。我们需要研究如何检测这些越狱提示。

Method: 我们分析了不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示和真实使用的能力，并通过微调BERT模型来识别越狱。

Result: 结果表明，使用当前数据集，通过端到端微调BERT模型可以达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 我们的结论是，提示结构中的显式反思可能是越狱意图的信号。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Motivation: The field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic capabilities of security systems across the security life cycle, a principled method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their performance in practice.

Method: We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle with core agentic capabilities, providing a common vocabulary and rubric for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. We also define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score, a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational effectiveness.

Result: By applying CLASP to 21 representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score, a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.

Conclusion: CLASP and the CLC Score provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure closed loop security agents.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,

Motivation: 为了支持有效的MDS模型的发展，需要稳健的自动评估方法来减少成本和人力努力。然而，这些方法需要一个基于人类注释的强元评估基准。

Method: 我们提出了一个新颖的过滤框架，利用跨模态的相互排斥关键信息（MEKI）来确保数据质量和丰富性，并引入了MDSEval，这是第一个针对MDS的元评估基准。

Result: 我们引入了MDSEval，这是第一个针对MDS的元评估基准，包含图像共享对话、相应的摘要和八个明确质量方面的用户判断。我们的工作是第一个识别并形式化MDS特定的关键评估维度。

Conclusion: 我们的工作是第一个识别并形式化MDS特定的关键评估维度，并基准测试了最先进的模态评估方法，揭示了它们在区分来自先进MLLM的摘要以及对各种偏差的敏感性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

### [56] [FOR-Prompting: From Objection to Revision via an Asymmetric Prompting Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01674)
*He Zhang,Anzhou Zhang,Jian Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting is an asymmetric reasoning protocol that improves accuracy and reasoning quality by incorporating external questioning and self-revision, showing promise for small models and personal device use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of an explicit mechanism for external questioning that elicits self-revision in existing reasoning protocols like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT).

Method: FOR-Prompting is an asymmetric protocol where a Defender proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections, and a Host enforces consistency and closure.

Result: FOR-Prompting achieves a 22% point gain over single-prompt on GSM8K and matches CoT in accuracy, with higher ratings in reasoning and coherence. It also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision and improves performance for small-scale models.

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and reasoning quality, showing promise for small models and personal device use, and it is model-agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level.

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在解决组合任务方面表现出色，但尚不清楚它们是否使用组合机制。本文旨在探讨这一点，并揭示模型在解决此类任务时的内部工作机制。

Method: 本文使用logit lens分析了前馈大型语言模型在残差流激活中的表现，以识别解决两跳事实回忆任务的两种处理机制。

Result: 研究发现现代大型语言模型仍然存在“组合性差距”，即它们能够计算z = f(x)和y = g(z)，但不一定能计算y = g(f(x))。同时，发现了两种不同的处理机制：一种是组合机制，另一种是直接机制。

Conclusion: 本文研究了前馈大型语言模型如何解决两跳事实回忆任务，并发现它们可能通过组合或直接机制来解决问题。此外，研究发现所采用的机制与嵌入空间几何有关。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域，监督微调（SFT）是适应大型语言模型（LLM）进行多轮对话生成的常见方法。然而，用于SFT的数据集在任务如医疗预咨询中通常表现出偏斜的回合数分布。

Method: 采用一种简单、以数据为中心的方法，重新平衡训练数据集的回合数分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法显著缓解了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著缓解了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

Motivation: 多模态推理模型在具有挑战性的领域（如奥赛级几何）中显示出前景，但其评估仍然由总体准确率主导，一个分数掩盖了模型在哪里以及如何改进。我们引入MathLens，这是一个基准测试，旨在解耦多模态推理的子技能，同时保持教科书风格几何问题的复杂性。

Method: 我们引入了MathLens，这是一个基准测试，旨在解耦多模态推理的子技能，同时保持教科书风格几何问题的复杂性。该基准将性能分为三个部分：感知（从原始输入中提取信息）、推理（对可用信息进行操作）和整合（选择相关的感知证据并在推理中应用）。为了支持每个测试，我们提供了注释：视觉图示、文本描述以单独评估推理、需要两种模态的控制问题以及用于细粒度感知技能的探测器，所有这些都来源于问题的符号规范，以确保一致性和鲁棒性。

Result: 我们的分析表明，不同的训练方法对模型的不同子技能有不均衡的影响。首先，强化学习主要增强了感知能力，尤其是在文本监督的支持下，而文本SFT通过反思推理间接提高了感知能力。其次，推理只有在与感知同步改进时才能提高。第三，整合仍然是最弱的能力，一旦其他技能进步，残余错误就集中在这一点上。最后，鲁棒性出现了分歧：RL在图示变化下提高了稳定性，而多模态SFT则由于过拟合而降低了稳定性。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

TL;DR: 本文展示了如何将工程设计标准的信息转换为模块化、可重用、机器可解释的本体，并将其用于工厂设计和设备选择的质量保证。通过语义推理和可执行的设计规则，实现了对阀门规范的自动化验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程设计过程需要遵守标准，但产品规格、产品类型数据表和设计标准仍然主要是以文档为中心，尽管有数字化工业工作的愿望。因此，需要一种方法来将这些信息转换为机器可解释的本体，以提高自动化验证和语义推理的能力。

Method: 通过建模模式将工程设计标准中的信息转换为模块化、可重用、机器可解释的本体，并使用这些本体进行工厂设计和设备选择的质量保证。创建了“功能位置标签”作为OWL个体，并与环境条件的语义表示一起实例化阀门数据表（VDS）指定的阀门。

Result: 基于国际材料和管道标准以及行业规范创建的本体在阀门选择过程中进行了测试。通过语义推理和可执行的设计规则，可以确定产品类型是否符合阀门规范，并验证特定的VDS是否符合相关行业标准。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的模块化本体为设计标准提供了共享和可重用的解决方案，使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，并展示了该方法对希望转向数字化智能标准的标准机构的潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

### [61] [Can LLMs Refuse Questions They Do Not Know? Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01782)
*Wenbo Pan,Jie Xu,Qiguang Chen,Junhao Dong,Libo Qin,Xinfeng Li,Haining Yu,Xiaohua Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric to measure how accurately Large Language Models (LLMs) refuse questions they do not know. RI is defined as Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability. Experiments show that RI accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in factual tasks and provides consistent model rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to faithfully measure the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to refuse to answer questions beyond their knowledge, which is crucial for factual reliability. Simple refusal-based metrics are biased by refusal rates, while existing calibration metrics are proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes rather than the model's actual refusal behavior.

Method: We propose the Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.

Result: Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy and refusal rates.

Conclusion: RI provides insight into an important but previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标，用于评估从1000份匿名化的俄罗斯司法判决中提取七个语义块的质量。结果显示，Term Frequency Coherence和Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness与专家评分最一致，而Legal Term Density表现出强烈的负相关。LLM Evaluation Score显示出中等一致性，但其性能表明其在法律文本上的专业性有限。研究指出，无监督指标可以实现可扩展的筛选，但不能完全替代人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在法律自然语言处理中的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估文本提取的质量。

Method: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标，包括新的公式，以评估从1000份匿名化的俄罗斯司法判决中提取七个语义块的质量，并与7168份专家评审进行对比，使用1-5级李克特量表。这些指标涵盖了文档基础、语义、结构、伪地面真实和法律特定类别，无需预标注的地面真实数据。通过自举相关性、Lin的同意相关系数（CCC）和平均绝对误差（MAE）来评估指标的表现。

Result: Term Frequency Coherence（皮尔逊r=0.540，Lin CCC=0.512，MAE=0.127）和Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness（皮尔逊r=0.513，Lin CCC=0.443，MAE=0.139）与专家评分最一致，而Legal Term Density（皮尔逊r=-0.479，Lin CCC=-0.079，MAE=0.394）表现出强烈的负相关。LLM Evaluation Score（均值=0.849，皮尔逊r=0.382，Lin CCC=0.325，MAE=0.197）显示出中等的一致性，但其性能（使用gpt-4.1-mini通过g4f）表明其在法律文本上的专业性有限。

Conclusion: 研究发现，无监督指标，包括基于LLM的方法，可以实现可扩展的筛选，但鉴于中等的相关性和低的CCC值，它们不能完全替代高风险法律环境中的主观判断。这项工作通过提供无需注释的评估工具，推进了法律NLP的发展，对司法分析和伦理AI部署有影响。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究发现大型语言模型在面对语义简单但句法不熟悉的问题时容易出现系统性错误，这些错误并非由于数学能力不足，而是由于表面形式和内部表示之间的脆弱关联。通过重新表述问题，可以减少结构复杂性并提高正确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学问题解决方面表现出强大的能力，但经常在与训练分布偏离的语法问题上失败。我们识别出一种系统性的失败模式，即句法盲点，在这种情况下，模型会将熟悉的推理策略错误地应用于语义简单但表达方式不熟悉的问题。

Method: 我们通过使用从正确示例中提取的句法模板重新表述回答错误的问题来测试这一假设。这些重述保持语义的同时减少了结构复杂性，通常会导致正确的答案。

Result: 我们使用基于依赖局部性理论（DLT）的度量来量化句法复杂性，并显示较高的DLT分数与多个数据集上的更高失败率相关。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，许多推理错误源于结构不对齐而非概念难度，并且语法意识的干预可以揭示和减轻这些归纳失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

Motivation: 现有方法在泛化能力或资源消耗方面存在不足，无法高效地从半结构化内容中提取结构化信息。

Method: SCRIBES是一种基于强化学习的框架，利用同一网站内网页之间的布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并通过合成注释进行迭代训练。

Conclusion: SCRIBES能够实现可扩展且资源高效的网络信息提取，显著提升了脚本质量和下游问答准确率。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

*Yisu Wang,Ming Wang,Haoyuan Song,Wenjie Huang,Chaozheng Wang,Yi Xie,Xuming Ran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为REPAIR的终身编辑框架，用于提高大型语言模型的编辑准确性和减少知识遗忘，同时保持非目标知识的完整性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练大型语言模型（LLMs）受到获取新知识或纠正错误的高成本以及重新训练时经常出现的意外副作用的限制。因此，需要一种更高效、低风险的模型更新方法

Method: REPAIR（Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and Reintegration）是一种终身编辑框架，旨在支持精确且低成本的模型更新，同时保留非目标知识。它通过闭环反馈机制和动态内存管理减轻大规模顺序编辑的不稳定性和冲突，并通过频繁的知识融合和强制局部性保护来解决传统分布无关方法的不足

Result: 实验表明，REPAIR在多个模型家族中将编辑准确性提高了10%-30%，并显著减少了知识遗忘

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种稳健的框架，用于开发可靠、可扩展且持续进化的大型语言模型（LLMs）

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文系统地介绍了奖励模型（RMs）及其在大型语言模型（LLM）推理中的应用，包括其架构、训练方法、评估技术以及关键应用场景，并讨论了RMs在选择、泛化、评估和增强方面的开放问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型（RMs）在增强大型语言模型（LLM）的推理性能方面起着关键作用。例如，它们可以在强化学习（RL）中为微调LLM提供训练信号，并在推理过程中帮助选择最佳答案。本文旨在系统介绍RMs，并全面调查其在LLM推理中的应用，以提供可行的见解。

Method: 本文系统地介绍了RMs，并全面调查了它们在LLM推理中的应用。首先回顾了RMs的基本概念，包括其架构、训练方法和评估技术。然后探讨了其关键应用：(1) 在LLM推理中指导生成和选择最优输出，(2) 促进数据合成和迭代自我改进，(3) 在基于强化学习的微调中提供训练信号。最后，根据现有研究和我们自己的实证结果，解决了RMs在选择、泛化、评估和增强方面的关键开放问题。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为奖励模型（RMs）在大型语言模型（LLM）推理中的有效部署和推进提供可行的见解。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为逆语言建模（ILM）的统一框架，旨在提高LLM对输入扰动的鲁棒性，并通过反转模型输出来识别潜在有毒或不安全的输入触发器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的防御机制景观是碎片化和不完善的，不像之前关于分类器的工作。为了进一步促进LLM的对抗鲁棒性，提出了ILM。

Method: 提出了一种统一的框架，称为逆语言建模（ILM），该框架同时提高了LLM对输入扰动的鲁棒性，并通过反转模型输出来识别潜在有毒或不安全的输入触发器。

Result: ILM将LLM从静态生成器转变为可分析和鲁棒的系统，可能有助于红队演练。

Conclusion: ILM可以为下一代LLM奠定基础，这些LLM不仅具有鲁棒性和基础性，而且从根本上更加可控和值得信赖。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

*Qi He,Cheng Qian,Xiusi Chen,Bingxiang He,Yi R.,Fung,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个在线强化学习框架Veri-R1，用于改进大型语言模型在声明验证任务中的表现。通过与搜索引擎交互并接收奖励信号，该框架能够更准确地反映现实世界的验证场景，并提升验证技能。实验结果表明，Veri-R1在联合准确率和证据分数方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线声明验证需要迭代的证据检索和推理，但现有方法主要依赖于提示工程或预设计的推理工作流程，而没有提供统一的训练范式来提高必要的技能。

Method: 我们引入了Veri-R1，一个在线强化学习（RL）框架，使LLM能够与搜索引擎交互并接收明确塑造其规划、检索和推理行为的奖励信号。

Result: 实证结果表明，Veri-R1将联合准确率提高了高达30%，证据分数翻了一番，通常超过更大的规模对手。消融研究进一步揭示了奖励组件的影响以及输出logits和标签准确性之间的联系。

Conclusion: 我们的结果突显了在线强化学习在精确和忠实的声明验证中的有效性，并为未来的研究提供了基础。我们发布了代码以支持社区在LLM驱动的声明验证方面的进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

*Adina Nicola Dobrinoiu,Ana Cristiana Marcu,Amir Homayounirad,Luciano Cavalcante Siebert,Enrico Liscio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型是否可以通过多维主观标注来预测个体的价值观念，并发现同时提供所有维度的效果优于单独维度和无个体信息的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的动机是认识到个体价值观念的主观性，这对于开发能够与多样化的观点对齐并避免多数观点偏见的AI系统非常重要。因此，研究试图探索语言模型是否能够通过多维主观标注来预测个体的价值观念。

Method: 本文通过实验评估了提供关于个体如何标注情感、情绪、论点和主题（SEAT维度）的例子是否有助于语言模型预测其价值观念。研究在不同的零样本和少样本设置中进行了实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，同时提供所有SEAT维度比单独维度和没有个体信息的基线表现更好。此外，注释者的个体差异突显了考虑个体主观注释者的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文的结论是，通过利用多维主观标注作为个体解释视角的代理，语言模型可以更好地预测个体的价值观念。此外，研究强调了考虑个体主观标注者的重要性，并为未来的大规模验证提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

*Ryosuke Kohita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们的研究显示，模式设计对NL2SQL系统的性能有重要影响，反规范化模式在简单查询中表现良好，而规范化模式在聚合查询中更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数先前的研究在固定模式上评估模型，忽略了设计对性能的影响。因此，我们需要系统地研究模式规范化的影响。

Method: 我们对八种领先的大型语言模型进行了系统研究，评估了它们在具有不同规范化水平的合成和真实世界数据集上的表现。

Result: 结果表明，反规范化模式在简单检索查询中提供了高准确性，而规范化模式（2NF/3NF）在零样本设置中引入了挑战，但通过提供少量示例可以显著缓解这些问题。对于聚合查询，规范化模式表现更好，主要是因为它们对数据重复和NULL值问题更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究展示了在开发NL2SQL接口时考虑模式设计的重要性，并提出了适应性模式选择以应对现实场景的需求。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

*Md Arid Hasan,Firoj Alam,Md Fahad Hossain,Usman Naseem,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了第一个多任务的孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并通过实验评估了LLM在低资源环境中的适应性，发现文化和语言基础的预训练对表现至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要可靠的检测系统，特别是在低资源语言中，如孟加拉语，目前的资源和模型大多为单一任务，覆盖范围有限。

Method: 我们引入了第一个多任务的孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，并在此基础上进行了一项全面、受控的比较，涵盖了经典基线、单语预训练模型和LLMs在零样本提示和LoRA微调下的表现。

Result: 实验评估了LLM在低资源环境中的适应性，并揭示了一个一致的趋势：虽然LoRA微调的LLM与BanglaBERT相当，但文化和语言基础的预训练对于稳健的表现仍然至关重要。

Conclusion: 我们的数据集和发现为在低资源环境中开发文化一致的审核工具建立了更强的基准。为了可重复性，我们将发布数据集和所有相关脚本。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

TL;DR: 本研究采用过程导向的方法，借助叙事学来审视大型语言模型作为计算作者的创造力。结果表明，LLMs更注重风格而非其他元素，并展示了不同模型的独特特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的创造力主要关注输出质量，而不是塑造它们的过程。本研究采用过程导向的方法，借鉴叙事学来审视LLMs作为计算作者。

Method: 我们引入了基于约束的决策制定作为作者创造力的视角，并使用受控提示来分配作者角色，以分析模型的创造偏好。

Result: LLMs始终强调风格，而其他元素包括角色、事件和场景。通过探测模型为其选择提供的推理，我们展示了模型之间的独特轮廓。

Conclusion: 我们的方法为分析AI的作者创造力提供了一个新颖的系统工具。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的流式RAG框架，以减少语音-语音对话系统中的工具使用延迟，并提高问答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端的语音-语音对话系统由于缺乏事实依据而容易产生幻觉。虽然基于文本的对话系统通过集成工具如网络搜索和知识图谱API来解决这个问题，但我们引入了第一个将工具使用直接扩展到语音-语音系统的方案。

Method: 我们提出了Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG)框架，通过在用户说话的同时预测工具查询来减少用户感知的延迟。我们开发了一个后训练管道，教会模型在进行中的语音中何时发出工具调用，并如何生成融合音频查询和检索文本结果的口语摘要。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的流式RAG方法将问答准确率提高了200%（从11.1%提高到34.2%的绝对值），并通过减少工具使用延迟20%进一步提升了用户体验。

Conclusion: 我们的流式RAG方法是模态无关的，可以同样应用于文本输入，为更自主、实时的AI助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SCoT的流式思维链框架，用于双工语音对话系统，通过交替处理用户输入和生成响应，实现了更连贯、可解释的响应，并支持更低延迟和重叠的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数端到端（E2E）语音对话系统（SDS）依赖于语音活动检测（VAD）进行话轮转换，但VAD无法区分暂停和话轮完成。双工SDS模型通过连续预测输出（包括静音标记）来解决这个问题，从而消除了显式VAD的需要。然而，它们通常具有复杂的双通道架构，并且在语义推理方面落后于级联模型。

Method: 我们提出了SCoT：一种用于双工SDS的流式思维链（CoT）框架，通过交替处理固定时长的用户输入和以块方式生成响应。使用帧级对齐，我们为每个块创建了中间目标对齐的用户转录本和系统响应。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在生成更连贯和可解释的响应方面优于现有的双工方法，同时支持比逐轮系统更低延迟和重叠的交互。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在生成更连贯和可解释的响应方面优于现有的双工方法，同时支持比逐轮系统更低延迟和重叠的交互。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

Motivation: 推测解码在不同任务中的速度提升并不均匀，对于欠拟合和代表性不足的任务，其提升效果往往较小。本文旨在理解这种现象并提出解决方案。

Method: 本文通过分析推测解码在不同任务中的速度提升差异，推导出一个量化这种“不公平”现象的分析，并提出了减轻速度提升不均的策略。

Result: 本文验证了提出的策略，结果显示在公平性指标上平均提升了12%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种减轻推测解码速度提升不均的策略，并通过多个模型对验证了该方法，平均在公平性指标上提升了12%。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RESTRAIN is a self-penalizing RL framework that improves reasoning without gold labels by utilizing signals from the model's entire answer distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve models without curated labels by adapting to unlabeled data, as traditional reinforcement learning with human-annotated data is costly and ineffective on harder tasks.

Method: RESTRAIN is a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of gold labels into a useful learning signal by penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency examples while preserving promising reasoning chains.

Result: RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data, improving Pass@1 by up to +140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.

Conclusion: RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward stronger reasoning without gold labels.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架RL4HS，用于检测幻觉跨度，并在多个基准测试中取得了优异的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实世界的应用需要识别幻觉跨度，这涉及多步骤决策过程。因此，我们想知道显式推理是否可以帮助复杂任务的幻觉跨度检测。

Method: 我们提出了RL4HS，这是一种基于强化学习的框架，通过跨度级奖励函数激励推理。RL4HS建立在Group Relative Policy Optimization之上，并引入了Class-Aware Policy Optimization来缓解奖励不平衡问题。

Result: RL4HS在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）中超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调，证明了使用跨度级奖励进行强化学习的必要性。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，RL4HS在检测幻觉跨度方面优于预训练推理模型和监督微调，证明了使用跨度级奖励进行强化学习的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

Motivation: 本文受到Text2SPARQL挑战的启发，旨在促进Text2SPARQL领域的改进。

Method: 本文介绍了一种基于SPINACH的LLM支持代理，该代理通过迭代探索和执行过程进行自然语言到SPARQL查询的翻译。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于SPINACH的通用方法，通过迭代探索和执行过程将自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询，以降低与知识图谱交互的门槛。

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估框架，用于检测移动使用代理中的推理-执行差距，并发现这些差距在各种任务中普遍存在，即使在大型模型中也存在显著的执行差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估主要关注执行准确性，而忽视了CoT推理是否与真实动作对齐。这种疏忽无法评估潜在的推理-执行差距，导致用户可能错误地信任看似合理的CoT，从而授权有害操作。

Method: 本文引入了一个新的评估框架，称为Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA)，用于衡量由CoT推断出的动作是否与真实动作一致。结合标准的Exact Match (EM)指标，同时评估推理准确性和执行准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，在各种移动交互任务中，推理-执行差距普遍存在，其中执行差距比推理差距更频繁。尽管扩大模型规模可以减少总体差距，但即使在最大模型中，显著的执行差距仍然存在。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个评估框架来诊断推理-执行差距，并展示了这种差距在移动交互任务中普遍存在，即使在最大的模型中也存在显著的执行差距。这些发现提供了具体的诊断，并支持开发更值得信赖的移动使用代理。

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMPO is a new framework that uses multiple teachers to guide learning in reinforcement learning for large language models, improving reasoning diversity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing methods in reinforcement learning for large language models, which rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher, leading to model biases and restricted exploration.

Method: AMPO is a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. It also incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism to balance exploration with exploitation.

Result: AMPO significantly outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), showing a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration.

Conclusion: AMPO demonstrates a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability, achieving comparable results to approaches that use a single, more powerful teacher with more data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for
automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory
(Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the
LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from
representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models
BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As
a result, the outcomes are generalize

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂问题上表现出色，但常常存在过度思考的问题，即为简单问题生成不必要的长推理步骤。这可能降低模型的效率，并使其难以适应问题的复杂性。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的度量标准Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA)，并提出了一种新的推理范式--Explore Briefly, Then Decide，以及相关的Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER)机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法显著减少了过度思考，同时没有牺牲解决问题的能力。在较简单的数据集上，平均响应长度减少了高达71%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在减少过度思考的同时保持了问题解决能力，证明了其在创建更高效和自适应推理过程中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了InfoMosaic-Bench，这是一个用于工具增强代理的多源信息检索基准，实验表明现有LLM代理在使用工具时仍存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM代理依赖于开放网络搜索，这存在两个基本弱点：在线内容嘈杂不可靠，许多现实任务需要精确的领域特定知识，而这些知识无法从网络上获得。

Method: 引入了InfoMosaic-Bench，这是一个专注于工具增强代理的多源信息检索基准。

Result: 实验显示，仅依靠网络信息是不够的，领域工具提供了选择性的但不一致的好处，并且22.4%的失败是由于错误的工具使用或选择。

Conclusion: 当前的LLM代理在使用工具时仍然面临挑战，尤其是在正确使用或选择工具方面。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

Conclusion: 我们的研究挑战了LRM推理模仿人类认知的假设，为开发更语言中立的LRM提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Motivation: 现有的评分系统将比赛视为两人游戏，如国际象棋，并应用Elo评分系统及其变体。然而，本文认为平局可能更多地反映了查询的难度，而不是模型的相等性。

Method: 本文对arena-style评估中的评分动态进行了批判性分析，特别是对平局是否意味着模型相等提出了质疑。

Result: 在三个真实世界的arena数据集上，忽略平局的评分更新可以提高1-3%的比赛结果预测准确率。此外，分析表明，平局更常出现在容易和高度客观的查询中。

Conclusion: 本文建议未来的评分系统应重新考虑现有的平局语义，并在评分更新中考虑查询特性。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Conclusion: 实验表明，选择性采样可以提高数学推理任务的质量-多样性权衡，即使在高温设置下也是如此。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出 RSAVQ，一种新型向量量化框架，用于改进大型语言模型的极低比特量化，通过几何驱动的方法解决方向误差和比特分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的向量量化方法面临两个关键挑战：无约束的方向误差和次优的比特分配。因此，需要一种新的框架来解决这些限制，以实现极低比特量化。

Method: RSAVQ 引入了两种几何驱动的创新：(1) 误差方向敏感性指导 (EDSG)，利用 Fisher 信息矩阵 (FIM) 引导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间中的低敏感方向上；(2) 权重通道敏感性指导 (WCSG)，通过 FIM 曲率分析构建通道级敏感性指标，以动态引导比特资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，RSAVQ 在 LLMs 的 2-bit 量化中优于现有方法。例如，在 LLaMA-3 8B 的 2-bit 量化中，RSAVQ 比 VPTQ 和 QuIP# 在困惑度 (PPL) 上高出 0.4，在零样本准确率上高出 1.5。

Conclusion: RSAVQ 提供了一种实用的解决方案，用于资源受限环境，并在信息几何和神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

Motivation: 当前大型推理模型的训练主要依赖于预训练和微调，但这种方法可能不是最优的。本文旨在探索一种更有效的训练方法。

Method: RLP通过将思维链视为探索性动作，并根据其提供的信息增益计算奖励，从而在预训练阶段引入强化学习。

Result: RLP在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上提升了8个数学和科学基准测试的平均得分19%，在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上提升了42.81%到61.32%。

Conclusion: RLP在预训练阶段引入了基于信息增益的强化学习目标，提高了模型的推理能力，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著提升。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个基于潘多拉魔盒问题的推理时优化框架，通过UCB风格的算法实现自适应的停止策略，在保持性能的同时显著减少了生成次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）生成通常需要在输出质量与推理成本之间取得平衡，尤其是在使用多次生成时。

Method: 我们引入了一个基于经典潘多拉魔盒问题的推理时优化框架。我们将每次生成视为打开一个具有随机奖励的昂贵“盒子”，并开发了在不知道底层奖励分布的情况下决定何时停止生成的算法。我们首先提出了一种UCB风格的潘多拉魔盒算法，其性能可以证明接近Weitzman的算法，即当分布已知时的最优策略。我们进一步通过利用Bradley-Terry启发式的转换来解决提示之间的奖励缩放问题，将这种方法适应到实际的LLM设置中。这导致了一种自适应的推理时优化方法，该方法可以对奖励进行归一化并在运行时学习停止阈值。

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验，使用多个LLM-奖励模型对，显示我们的自适应策略可以在平均减少15-35%的生成次数的情况下获得与非自适应Best-of-N采样相同的表现。

Conclusion: 我们的结果建立了一个原则性的桥梁，将最优停止理论与推理时缩放联系起来，为LLM部署提供了理论性能界限和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LSPO, a new RLVR algorithm that enhances learning effectiveness by dynamically selecting training data based on response length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overthinking in LLMs and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of RLVR.

Method: Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data based on average response length.

Result: LSPO demonstrates consistent improvements in learning effectiveness across multiple base models and datasets.

Conclusion: LSPO consistently improves learning effectiveness and offers promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRAAC is a method that improves reasoning efficiency and accuracy by adapting the thinking budget based on task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses under-adaptivity, where models fail to modulate their response length appropriately for problems of varying difficulty. It aims to strike a balance between under- and overthinking.

Method: TRAAC is an online post-training RL method that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to identify important steps and prune redundant ones. It estimates difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards to allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty.

Result: TRAAC achieves an average absolute accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8% compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length drop compared to the best RL baseline. It also shows strong generalization on non-math datasets.

Conclusion: TRAAC improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking compared to base models and other RL baselines. It also shows strong generalization across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究挑战了高SFT得分是否能提升RL性能，并发现泛化损失和Pass@large k性能是更好的预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的后训练方法分为两个独立阶段：SFT和RLVR。然而，高SFT得分并不一定意味着在RL中表现更好，因此需要寻找更可靠的指标来预测RL结果。

Method: 研究通过训练数百个模型（最多12B参数）并进行GRPO的SFT和RLVR，进行了广泛的评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接基于预RL性能的预测具有更高的精度，R²系数和Spearman等级相关系数提高了高达0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: 研究发现，SFT得分并不能可靠地预测后续RL增益或扩展后的训练效果。通过使用泛化损失和Pass@large k性能作为代理指标，可以更准确地预测RL结果。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实验研究了合成数据在预训练中的效果，发现混合数据的组合可以提高效率，但合成数据的比例需根据模型大小和数据预算调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据在大型语言模型（LLM）扩展中起着关键作用，但高质量的数据供应有限。合成数据技术提供了一种潜在的途径来绕过这些限制。

Method: 本文进行了一项大规模的实证研究（超过1000个LLM，超过10万GPU小时），使用统一的协议和缩放定律，比较了自然网络数据、多种合成数据类型（重述文本、生成教科书）以及自然和合成数据的混合。

Result: 预训练在单独的重述合成数据上并不比预训练在自然网络文本上更快；而预训练在1/3重述合成数据与2/3自然网络文本混合的情况下，可以在更大的数据预算下加快5-10倍（达到相同的验证损失）。单独预训练在教科书风格的合成数据上会在许多下游领域产生显著更高的损失，尤其是在小数据预算下。合成数据在训练数据混合中的“好”比例取决于模型大小和数据预算，经验上收敛到约30%的重述合成数据。更大的生成器模型并不一定比约8B参数模型提供更好的预训练数据。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了合成数据在预训练中的作用，验证了其条件性优势，并提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), an attention architecture that reduces the number of Query heads to lower the computational complexity of the attention mechanism, achieving significant throughput improvements in computation-bound scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic computational complexity of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling, particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions do not reduce the fundamental number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation.

Method: This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention architecture that reduces the number of Query heads to decrease the computational complexity of the attention mechanism.

Result: Empirical benchmarks on long sequences demonstrate that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary small-scale experiments.

Conclusion: SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements in computation-bound scenarios with only a minimal impact on model quality, suggesting its potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

TL;DR: 本文介绍了StockBench，一个用于评估LLM代理在真实股票交易环境中表现的基准。结果显示，虽然大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入并持有策略，但一些模型展示了更高的回报和更好的风险管理潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域在经济价值和高风险决策方面具有直接相关性，但现有的金融基准主要通过问答测试静态知识，未能捕捉到交易的动态和迭代性质。

Method: 引入StockBench，这是一个无污染的基准，旨在评估LLM代理在现实、多月股票交易环境中的表现。代理接收每日市场信号，并必须做出顺序的买入、卖出或持有决策。

Result: 对最先进的专有模型（如GPT-5、Claude-4）和开放权重模型（如Qwen3、Kimi-K2、GLM-4.5）的评估显示，尽管大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入并持有基线，但一些模型展示了提供更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在开发LLM驱动的金融代理方面的挑战和机遇，表明在静态金融知识任务中表现出色并不一定能转化为成功的交易策略。我们发布了StockBench作为一个开源资源，以支持可重复性和推动该领域未来的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

Result: 实验表明，ExGRPO在五个基础模型上 consistently 提高了数学/通用基准的推理性能，平均提高了+3.5/7.6分。此外，ExGRPO在更强和更弱的模型上稳定了训练，而基于策略的方法在此时失败。

Conclusion: 本文强调了有原则的经验管理在高效和可扩展的RLVR中的关键作用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的研究探索了使用大型语言模型进行推荐任务，通过将用户交互历史和项目元数据转换为文本提示，然后让LLM生成排名或推荐。一种有前景的方法涉及通过紧凑的适配器网络将协同过滤知识连接到LLM表示，这避免了昂贵的微调，同时保留了两者的优点。然而，在实践中仍存在几个挑战：协同过滤模型经常使用静态快照，无法捕捉快速变化的用户偏好；许多现实世界的项目包含超出文本描述的丰富视觉和音频内容；当前系统难以提供可信的解释并得到具体证据。

Method: 我们开发了一个在线适应机制，通过轻量级模块持续整合新的用户交互，避免重新训练大型模型。我们创建了一个统一的表示，无缝结合协同信号与视觉和音频特征，处理某些模态可能不可用的情况。最后，我们设计了一个解释系统，将推荐基于特定的协同模式和项目属性，生成用户可以验证的自然语言理由。

Result: 我们的工作引入了\model{}，一个通过三个关键创新解决这些限制的框架。

Conclusion: 我们的方法保持了冻结基础模型的效率，同时增加了最小的计算开销，使其适用于现实世界的部署。

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 当代生成推荐系统在处理多模态数据、消除算法偏差和提供透明决策过程方面面临重大挑战。

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

TL;DR: 研究了开源大型语言模型作为Promptagator风格查询生成器的可行性，发现小型开源模型也能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的Promptagator方法依赖于专有且大规模的LLM，用户可能无法访问或被禁止使用敏感数据。

Method: 研究了开源大型语言模型在可访问规模（≤14B参数）作为替代方案的影响。

Result: 结果表明，参数量小至3B的开源LLM可以作为有效的Promptagator风格查询生成器。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为合成数据生成提供了可靠的替代方案，并为最大化领域特定应用的微调结果提供了见解。

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

open-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and
accuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10
billion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the
National Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation
codes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法容易被检测到，因为它们有明显的恶意意图。而LLMs的对齐防御对嵌套场景不敏感，这是一个尚未充分探索的方向。

Method: RTS-Attack是一种自适应且自动化的框架，通过构建与查询高度相关的情景并整合有针对性的有毒知识来检查LLMs的对齐情况。

Result: RTS-Attack在效率和通用性方面优于基线方法，在多种先进的LLM中表现优异。

Conclusion: RTS-Attack能够有效绕过LLMs的对齐防御，并在多种先进的LLM中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting
harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted
across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these
methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In
this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs'
alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios
are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic
knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on
this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with
Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs'
alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating
targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs.
Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful
queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and
universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the
supplementary material. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

TL;DR: 本研究首次对针对网络代理的提示注入攻击检测进行了全面基准测试。我们提出了攻击分类，构建了包含恶意和良性样本的数据集，并系统化了检测方法。结果表明，现有检测器在面对隐晦或难以察觉的攻击时效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，虽然已经开发出各种方法来检测一般的提示注入攻击，但还没有系统地评估针对网络代理的攻击。因此，我们进行了这项研究以填补这一空白。

Method: 我们首先根据威胁模型引入了一种细粒度的攻击分类。然后构建了包含恶意和良性样本的数据集：由不同攻击生成的恶意文本片段、四个类别的良性文本片段、由攻击生成的恶意图像以及两个类别的良性图像。接下来，我们系统化了基于文本和图像的检测方法。最后，我们在多个场景中评估了它们的性能。

Result: 我们的关键发现表明，尽管一些检测器可以以中等至高精度识别依赖于显式文本指令或可见图像扰动的攻击，但它们在面对省略显式指令或使用难以察觉的扰动的攻击时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 我们的研究显示，尽管一些检测器可以以中等至高精度识别依赖于显式文本指令或可见图像扰动的攻击，但它们在面对省略显式指令或使用难以察觉的扰动的攻击时表现不佳。

Abstract: Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At
the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt
injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.
In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive
benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We
begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the
threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign
samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text
segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign
images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and
image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across
multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can
identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image
perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks
that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our
datasets and code are released at:

TL;DR: 本文探讨了LLM系统中的多种隐私风险，强调需要从更广泛的角度看待隐私问题，并呼吁研究界采取跨学科方法来应对这些新兴威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在指出LLM系统中的隐私问题不仅限于训练数据提取，还涉及数据收集实践、推理时的上下文泄露、自主代理能力以及通过深度推理攻击实现的监控民主化等更广泛的风险。

Method: 本文通过纵向分析过去十年（2016-2025年）在顶级会议上发表的1322篇AI/ML隐私论文，提出了一个全面的隐私风险分类法，并通过案例研究展示了当前隐私框架未能解决这些多方面的威胁。

Result: 研究发现，尽管记忆化在技术研究中受到过度关注，但最紧迫的隐私危害却存在于当前技术方法无法解决的领域，可行的前进路径仍然不明确。

Conclusion: 本文呼吁研究界在LLM隐私问题上进行根本性的转变，超越当前技术解决方案的狭窄焦点，采用跨学科的方法来应对这些新兴威胁的社会技术性质。

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a
constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain
underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM
systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from
data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent
capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference
attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM
lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through
case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted
threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers
published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal
that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the
most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches
offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a
fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving
beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing
interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these
emerging threats.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受黑板架构启发的新型多智能体通信范式，以解决大型异构数据湖中数据发现的问题。实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在处理大型异构数据湖中的相关数据发现时存在困难：单智能体系统容易被大量、异构的文件淹没，而基于主从范式的多智能体系统依赖于一个需要精确了解每个子智能体能力的刚性中央控制器。

Method: 我们提出了一种受传统AI模型中黑板架构启发的新型多智能体通信范式。在这个框架中，一个中央代理将请求发布到共享的黑板上，自主的下级代理根据其能力自愿响应。

Result: 实验结果表明，黑板架构在端到端任务成功率和数据发现的F1分数方面显著优于基线方法，包括RAG和主从多智能体范式，在专有和开源大型语言模型上均取得了13%至57%的相对改进以及高达9%的相对增益。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，黑板架构作为一种可扩展且通用的多智能体通信框架，具有显著的优势。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: AGILE通过交互式拼图学习提升VLMs的视觉感知和推理能力，显著改善了性能并具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLMs在简单拼图任务上的表现接近随机，表明其核心感知和推理能力存在不足。高质量的视觉-语言数据虽然可以增强这些能力，但其稀缺性和有限的可扩展性带来了重大限制。

Method: AGILE将拼图解决过程建模为交互式过程，使模型能够逐步与环境互动。在每一步，模型根据当前状态生成可执行代码来执行操作，而环境提供细粒度的视觉反馈以指导任务完成。

Result: 实验结果表明，AGILE不仅显著提高了不同复杂度的拼图任务性能（例如，在2×2设置下准确率从9.5%提高到82.8%），还在9个通用视觉任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，平均提高了3.1%。

Conclusion: AGILE显著提升了视觉感知和推理能力，并为多模态模型的推理和泛化提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

*Xinpeng Wang,Nitish Joshi,Barbara Plank,Rico Angell,He He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE is a new method for detecting implicit reward hacking by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to pass a verifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a significant threat. Current monitoring methods are ineffective in detecting implicit reward hacking.

Method: TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation) quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. It progressively truncates a model's CoT at various lengths, forces the model to answer, and measures the verifier-passing rate at each cutoff.

Result: TRACE achieves over 65% gains over the strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. It can also discover unknown loopholes during training.

Conclusion: TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Motivation: 大型语言模型代理在多步骤任务中经常以可预测的方式失败，例如尝试未满足前提条件的操作、发出冗余命令或处理环境约束不当。虽然检索增强生成（RAG）可以通过提供运行时指导来提高性能，但它需要维护外部知识数据库，并在每次部署时增加计算开销。

Method: 该方法通过三个步骤：(1) 从代理失败中提取紧凑、可重用的提示，(2) 使用这些提示通过一次检索生成改进的教师轨迹，(3) 在移除提示字符串的情况下，使用这些轨迹对学生模型进行训练，以强制内化而非记忆。

Result: 在两个交互式基准测试中，ALFWorld（家庭任务）和WebShop（在线购物），蒸馏的学生模型始终优于基线代理，在ALFWorld上达到了91%的成功率（基线为79%），并将WebShop分数提高到72（基线为61%），同时使用的token比检索增强教师少10-60%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了通过针对性微调，可以有效地将检索优势内化，而无需永久的运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法VOGUE，用于解决多模态语言模型在探索方面的问题。通过将探索从文本转移到视觉空间，并利用视觉输入的不确定性来指导探索，VOGUE显著提高了模型在多个基准测试中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）提高了大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，但仍然存在探索问题，这对于多模态LLMs（MLLMs）来说仍然是一个问题。当前的方法将视觉输入视为固定、确定性的条件，忽略了关键的模糊来源，并且难以构建对合理视觉变化具有鲁棒性的策略。

Method: 我们引入了VOGUE（视觉不确定性引导探索），这是一种新方法，将探索从输出（文本）转移到输入（视觉）空间。通过将图像视为随机上下文，VOGUE使用“原始”和“噪声”分支之间的对称KL散度来量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，从而创建一个直接的不确定性感知探索信号。

Result: 在两个模型规模（Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B）上实现的VOGUE，在三个视觉数学基准测试中平均提升了2.6%的pass@1准确率，在三个通用领域推理基准测试中平均提升了3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能并缓解了RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，将探索建立在视觉输入的固有不确定性上是提高多模态推理的有效策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: InfoSeeker是一种结合任务导向规划与信息寻求的LLM决策框架，旨在对齐内部动态并在不确定的代理观察和环境动态下做出最优决策。实验表明，它在不牺牲样本效率的情况下，相对于先前的方法取得了74%的绝对性能提升，并且在不同的LLM上都能泛化，表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）规划代理虽然解决了观测不确定性，但常常忽略了它们的内部动态与实际环境之间的差异。

Method: InfoSeeker是一种将任务导向规划与信息寻求相结合的LLM决策框架，旨在对齐内部动态并在不确定的代理观察和环境动态下做出最优决策。

Result: 实验表明，InfoSeeker在不牺牲样本效率的情况下，相对于先前的方法取得了74%的绝对性能提升。此外，InfoSeeker在不同的LLM上都能泛化，并且在诸如机器人操作和网络导航等已建立的基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在部分可观测环境中将规划和信息寻求紧密结合的重要性。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大型语言模型通过逆向思考提高安全性的方法，在多个高风险领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，而InvThink旨在通过逆向思考提高模型的安全性。

Method: InvThink方法通过让模型先枚举潜在危害、分析其后果，并生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出，来实现逆向思考。

Result: InvThink在模型规模上显示出更强的安全性提升，减轻了安全性负担，并在高风险领域表现出色，相比基线方法如SafetyPrompt，有害响应减少了最多15.7%。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了一条可扩展和可泛化的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在心理辅导中的应用潜力，并通过PsychoBench基准测试评估了它们的能力。结果显示，只有前沿的LLM能够达到咨询考试的标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM是否可以有效地应用于心理辅导，特别是评估它们是否能够通过美国国家咨询师认证考试（NCE）。

Method: 引入PsychoBench，这是一个基于美国国家咨询师认证考试的基准，用于评估LLM作为咨询师的能力。

Result: 先进的模型如GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B的表现远超及格线，而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）则远低于及格线。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，只有前沿的LLM目前能够达到咨询考试标准，这突显了开发面向心理学的LLM的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了计算机使用代理的盲目目标导向性（BGD）现象，并提出了一个名为BLIND-ACT的基准测试，用于评估和减轻这种风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理（CUAs）在GUI上采取行动以实现用户目标，但它们表现出盲目的目标导向性（BGD），这可能导致潜在的风险。我们需要识别和减轻这种风险。

Method: 我们开发了BLIND-ACT，这是一个包含90个任务的基准测试，捕捉了三种BGD模式。基于OSWorld，BLIND-ACT提供了现实环境，并使用基于LLM的裁判来评估代理行为。

Result: BLIND-ACT实现了与人类注释93.75%的一致性，评估九个前沿模型，发现平均BGD率为80.8%。提示干预可以降低BGD水平，但仍然存在显著风险。

Conclusion: 识别BGD并引入BLIND-ACT为未来研究提供了基础，以研究和减轻这种基本风险，并确保安全的CUA部署。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法存在局限性，因为缺乏对最终状态的完美评估方法，只能通过小型测试来提供方向性指示。然而，这些测试在AI历史中表现不佳。

Method: 本文基于数据科学中的常见实践，提出了评估AGI的新方法，强调系统在实际应用中的可靠性。

Result: 本文提供了具体例子，说明如何将稳健任务执行应用于AGI评估。

Conclusion: 本文认为AGI评估方法应该从依赖直觉设计合成任务的哲学转向关注稳健任务执行的哲学，以展示AGI的能力。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PTA-GRPO的两阶段框架，旨在提高大型语言模型的高层次规划和细粒度推理能力。通过实验验证，该方法在多个数学推理基准测试中表现出色，具有良好的效果和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务中表现出卓越的推理能力，但受限于自回归的逐标记生成，推理过程主要局限于局部决策，缺乏全局规划，导致冗余、不连贯或不准确的推理，严重影响整体性能。现有的方法如基于树的算法和强化学习（RL）试图解决这一问题，但计算成本高且难以产生最优的推理轨迹。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段框架，称为Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (PTA-GRPO)，旨在提高高层次规划和细粒度的CoT推理。第一阶段利用先进的LLM将CoT提炼为紧凑的高层指导，然后用于监督微调（SFT）。第二阶段引入了一种感知指导的强化学习方法，联合优化最终输出和高层指导的质量，从而增强推理效果。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（包括MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025和AMC）上进行了广泛实验，覆盖了多种基础模型，如Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct、Qwen3-8B、Qwen3-14B和LLaMA3.2-3B。实验结果表明，PTA-GRPO在不同模型和任务中均实现了稳定且显著的改进。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks, validating its effectiveness and generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS)，一种在不扭曲分布的情况下严格提高拒绝采样样本效率的方法。CARS通过自适应剪枝确保无效前缀不会被重新访问，从而提高接受率并生成符合约束分布的样本。在程序模糊测试和分子生成等领域的实验表明，CARS在效率和样本多样性方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的约束生成方法存在两个极端问题：贪婪的约束解码方法在解码过程中强制有效性但扭曲了LM的分布，而拒绝采样（RS）虽然保持了保真度但通过丢弃无效输出浪费了计算资源。在程序模糊测试等领域，样本的有效性和多样性都是必不可少的。

Method: CARS通过从无约束的LM采样开始，自适应地通过记录在trie中并从未来的抽样中减去它们的概率质量来排除违反约束的延续。这种自适应剪枝确保了已证明无效的前缀永远不会被重新访问，接受率单调提高，并且生成的样本准确遵循约束分布。

Result: CARS在各种领域中表现出更高的效率（以每有效样本的LM前向传递次数衡量），并且在样本多样性方面优于GCD和其他近似LM分布的方法。

Conclusion: CARS在各种领域（如程序模糊测试和分子生成）中 consistently 实现了更高的效率，并且在样本多样性方面优于GCD和其他近似LM分布的方法。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了 AI 模型在 ConceptARC 上的抽象能力，发现尽管某些模型在文本模态中达到人类水平的准确性，但它们的规则通常基于表面层次的“捷径”。在视觉模态中，模型的准确性下降，但它们仍能捕捉到一些预期的抽象概念。研究认为，仅凭准确性无法准确评估 AI 的抽象推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们想了解最先进的模型是否能够识别和推理任务创建者意图的抽象概念。

Method: 我们评估了模型在不同输入模态（文本与视觉）、是否允许使用外部 Python 工具以及对于推理模型的推理努力程度下的表现。除了测量输出准确性外，我们还对模型生成的解释其解决方案的自然语言规则进行了细粒度评估。

Result: 虽然一些使用文本表示的模型匹配了人类的输出准确性，但最佳模型的规则通常基于表面层次的“捷径”，并且比人类更少捕捉到预期的抽象概念。在视觉模态中，AI 模型的输出准确性急剧下降，但我们的规则级分析表明，模型可能被低估了，因为它们仍然表现出大量捕捉预期抽象概念的规则，但往往无法正确应用这些规则。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，模型在抽象推理方面仍然落后于人类，并且使用准确性 alone 来评估 ARC 类任务的抽象推理可能会高估文本模态中的抽象推理能力，并低估视觉模态中的抽象推理能力。我们认为，我们的评估框架提供了对多模态模型抽象推理能力更真实的图景，并提供了一种更系统的方法来跟踪向以抽象为中心的人类智能进展。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

Conclusion: 本文为DRA系统的能力评估、架构优化和范式进步提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，揭示了RLVR中的两个关键现象：负干扰和赢家通吃现象，并提出了一种数据整理算法。

Result: 发现RLVR中的负干扰和赢家通吃现象，导致Pass@$k$性能下降；通过数据整理算法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个简单但有效的数据整理算法，专注于低可能性问题的RLVR学习，显著提高了Pass@$k$性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Result: 在OSWorld上，我们的bBoN扩展方法在69.9%的准确率上建立了新的最先进的状态（SoTA），显著优于之前的方法，并接近72%的人类水平性能，全面的消融实验验证了关键设计选择。我们进一步展示了在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld不同操作系统上的强大泛化结果。

Conclusion: 我们的结果突显了正确扩展CUAs的非合理有效性：有效的扩展需要结构化的轨迹理解和选择，而bBoN提供了一个实用的框架来实现这一点。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Motivation: 现有的大型模型在推理过程中往往无法一致地捕捉或重用程序，而是陷入冗长和退化的探索。因此，需要一种更有效的推理方法。

Method: 本文引入了推理抽象，即简洁的自然语言描述，用于指导模型学习有效的推理过程。模型被训练为根据问题提出多个抽象，并通过强化学习激励使用这些抽象构建解决方案。

Result: 实验结果表明，分配更多测试时间的计算资源来生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更能提高性能，证明了抽象在引导有意义探索中的作用。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为RLAD的两阶段强化学习训练范式，通过引入推理抽象来提高模型在解决复杂问题时的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Abstract: The exponential growth of information presents a significant challenge for
researchers and professionals seeking to remain at the forefront of their
fields and this paper introduces an innovative framework for automatically
generating insightful financial digests using the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs), specifically Google's Gemini Pro. By leveraging a combination of
data extraction from OpenAlex, strategic prompt engineering, and LLM-driven
analysis, we demonstrate the automated example of creating a comprehensive
digests that generalize key findings, identify emerging trends. This approach
addresses the limitations of traditional analysis methods, enabling the
efficient processing of vast amounts of unstructured data and the delivery of
actionable insights in an easily digestible format. This paper describes how
LLMs work in simple words and how we can use their power to help researchers
and scholars save their time and stay informed about current trends. Our study
includes step-by-step process, from data acquisition and JSON construction to
interaction with Gemini and the automated generation of PDF reports, including
a link to the project's GitHub repository for broader accessibility and further
development.
