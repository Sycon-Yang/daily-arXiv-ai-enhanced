This\nreality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of\nidentifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.\n  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference\nframework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM\nto overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data.

Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a\none-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'\nvarying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop\nPersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address\nversatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two\ncomplementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic\nand semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the\nagent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona\n(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:\nit leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while\nthe outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the\nframework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that\nsimulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring\nreal-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between\nsimulated and ground-truth responses.

MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims.
