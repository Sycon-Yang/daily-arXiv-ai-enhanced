### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过构建包含140,750张百度和腾讯街景图像和984,024条微博社交媒体文本的数据库，分析了城市环境中人类感知和意见之间的情感不一致，并提出了潜在的环境管理策略和城市更新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，引发了嵌入在人类感知和意见中的细微情感反应变化，这挑战了现有的多维情感分析方法。

Method: 本研究开发了一种反应指数，结合了目标检测和自然语言处理技术，用于分类北京二环路2016年和2022年的感情。使用回归分析、图像分割和基于土地利用分布的词频分析了分类的感情反应。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示积极情感更加均匀分布，而意见情感反应趋势图显示更极端的变化。我们的不匹配图表明，多年来城市地区的人类感知和意见之间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市环境中人类感知和意见之间的情感不一致，并提出了潜在的环境管理策略和城市更新方向。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出HaystackCraft基准，用于评估长上下文模型在嘈杂环境下的鲁棒性，并揭示了代理式长上下文推理中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代长上下文大型语言模型（LLMs）在合成的'needle-in-a-haystack'（NIAH）基准上表现良好，但这些测试忽略了从有偏检索和代理工作流中产生的嘈杂上下文。需要进行haystack工程来构建能够真实反映关键现实因素的嘈杂长上下文。

Method: 通过HaystackCraft，一个基于完整英文维基百科超链接网络的新NIAH基准，对异构检索策略（如稀疏、密集、混合和基于图的）如何影响干扰物组成、haystack排序和下游LLM性能进行了评估。此外，HaystackCraft进一步将NIAH扩展到动态、LLM依赖的设置，模拟代理操作。

Result: 实验显示，虽然更强的密集检索器可以引入更具挑战性的干扰物，但基于图的重新排序同时提高了检索效果并减轻了更有害的干扰物；在代理测试中，即使是先进的模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-5也会因自生成的干扰物而出现级联失败，或难以进行早期停止。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了在代理式长上下文推理中的持续挑战，并确立了HaystackCraft作为未来进步的重要测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究大型语言模型在上下文词干化任务中的有效性，并与传统方法进行比较。

Method: 本文通过实验研究了最新一代大型语言模型在上下文词干化任务中的能力，并将其与传统的完全监督方法进行了比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前的大型语言模型在提供少量示例的情况下，可以直接生成词干而无需事先微调，从而在大多数语言中达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，尽管编码器在微调后在跨领域设置中仍然具有竞争力，但当前的大型语言模型在提供少量示例的情况下，可以直接生成词干而无需事先微调，从而在大多数语言中达到了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于大语言模型的评分标准LASER，能够更公平地评估语音识别结果，并展示了其在多种印度语言中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标准语音识别评估指标（如词错误率WER）倾向于不公平地惩罚不会显著改变句子语义的形态和语法细微差别。

Method: LASER利用了最先进的大语言模型的上下文学习能力，通过详细的示例提示进行学习。此外，还展示了如何微调较小的模型来预测应施加的惩罚。

Result: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro的Hindi LASER评分与人工标注具有很高的相关性（94%）。Hindi示例在分析其他印度语言（如马拉地语、卡纳达语和马拉雅拉姆语）中的错误也有效。此外，较小的模型如Llama 3在单词对示例上微调后，可以以接近89%的准确率预测应施加的惩罚。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的评分标准LASER，能够更公平地评估语音识别结果，减少了对形态和语法细微差别的不公平惩罚。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于人体骨骼姿势的手语话语评估方法，并展示了不同度量方法在不同场景中的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了有意义地评估手语话语，我们进行了全面的研究。

Method: 关键点距离-based、嵌入-based 和反向翻译-based 的度量方法。

Result: 通过自动元评估和人类相关性研究，展示了不同度量方法在不同场景中的权衡。

Conclusion: 我们的研究和开源姿态评估工具包为开发和评估手语翻译或生成系统提供了实用且可重复的方法。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于评分和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，以模仿人类编码器的培训过程。通过利用全球民粹主义数据库，我们发现这种特定领域的提示策略使LLM能够达到与专家人类编码器相当的分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量民粹主义的思想内容仍然是一项挑战。传统的基于文本分析的策略对于建立该领域的基础和提供民粹主义框架的有效、客观指标至关重要。然而，这些方法成本高、耗时长，并且难以在语言、情境和大型语料库中扩展。

Method: 本文采用了一种基于评分和锚点引导的思维链（CoT）提示方法，该方法模仿了人类编码器的培训过程。通过利用全球民粹主义数据库（GPD），我们复制了用于培训人类编码器的过程，通过提示LLM使用相同文档的改编版本来指导模型的推理。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，这种特定领域的提示策略使LLM能够达到与专家人类编码器相当的分类准确性，证明了其在处理民粹主义的细微和上下文敏感方面的能力。

Conclusion: 本文表明，这种特定领域的提示策略使LLM能够达到与专家人类编码器相当的分类准确性，证明了其在处理民粹主义的细微和上下文敏感方面的能力。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MAPRO，一种用于多智能体提示优化的框架，通过将问题公式化为最大后验推理问题并使用语言引导的算法求解，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计有效的多智能体系统（MAS）仍然具有挑战性，因为提示敏感性和MAS创建的复合不稳定性。虽然最近的自动化提示设计努力减少了手动工作，但多智能体提示优化仍然 largely 未被探索。

Method: MAPRO是一种四阶段框架，首先将MAS提示优化问题公式化为最大后验（MAP）推理问题，并使用语言引导的最大乘积信念传播算法求解。为了处理信用分配并迭代更新系统，MAPRO采用了一种拓扑感知的细化机制，整合执行反馈和下游责备以选择性地更新代理提示。

Result: MAPRO在各种任务的基准测试中实现了最先进的性能， consistently 超过手动工程基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO在各种任务的基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，同时为构建更可靠和有原则的多智能体系统提供了通用指南。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade 是一种高效的 TTS 异步框架，通过时间回归模块和异步解耦机制，显著提升了模型性能并降低了运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的查询感知稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖的页面过滤和粗粒度的标记选择，影响了服务效率和模型在 TTS 任务中的性能。

Method: AsyncSpade 采用两个核心组件：(1) 一种轻量级的时间回归模块，用于预测下一个标记的查询状态；(2) 一种异步和解耦的框架，将 KV 缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步性将令牌级别的 KV 选择与前向推理计算重叠。

Result: AsyncSpade 在 A100 节点上验证了其有效性，能够完全将 KV 缓存操作与推理流水线重叠，实现理论上的最优每输出标记时间 (TPOT)。相比 SoTA 基线（如 Quest），AsyncSpade 的 TPOT 减少了 20% 以上，并且在 Qwen3-8B 和 Qwen3-32B 模型上比全注意力机制减少了至少 50% 的 TPOT，同时在各种 TTS 基准测试中保持或超越了准确性。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade 是第一个在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除顺序依赖性的框架，并在多个 TTS 基准测试中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多智能体系统中的团队动态，发现扁平化团队表现优于层级化团队，多样性影响复杂，代理对团队表现过于自信，但任务后反思显示合作价值和整合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体系统（MAS）与大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的代理越来越受到关注，但较少研究探讨它们的团队动态。受人类团队科学的启发，本研究旨在探索团队科学的核心方面。

Method: 研究提出了一种多智能体框架，用于检查团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态。通过四个任务评估团队性能：CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa 和 Latent Implicit Hate。

Result: 研究结果表明，扁平化团队在任务表现上优于层级化团队，而多样性对性能的影响较为复杂。访谈显示代理对团队表现过于自信，但任务后反思揭示了合作的价值和整合挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 研究发现，扁平化团队在任务表现上优于层级化团队，而多样性的影响较为复杂。访谈表明，代理对团队表现过于自信，但任务后反思显示他们既欣赏合作，也面临整合挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过链式思维微调和基于熵的指标'问题完整性'来提高多流语音大语言模型的推理能力和响应速度，并通过DPO方法进一步优化了准确性和延迟的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音大语言模型（speech LLMs）在语音交互方面取得了进展，但它们在复杂推理任务上仍然存在困难。因此，需要一种有效的方法来提高这些模型的推理能力和响应速度。

Method: 本文研究了链式思维微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，并提出了一种基于熵的指标'问题完整性'来指导模型在最佳时间开始推理。此外，还使用直接偏好优化（DPO）方法对偏好数据进行优化，以进一步推动准确性和延迟的帕累托前沿。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过链式思维微调，语音LLMs的准确性平均提高了2.4倍。此外，基于'问题完整性'的指标方法在相同延迟条件下，ARC-Easy数据集上的准确性提高了4%。最后，通过DPO方法，实现了70%的延迟减少而没有损失准确性。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入基于熵的指标'问题完整性'和使用直接偏好优化（DPO）方法，成功提高了多流语音大语言模型在准确性和延迟之间的权衡，实现了70%的延迟减少而没有损失准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ToTAL的框架，通过思想模板增强长上下文语言模型，以改进多跳推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的长上下文语言模型（LCLMs）可以处理单个提示中的数十万标记，为知识密集型多跳推理提供了新的机会。然而，仅仅将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法捕捉证据应该如何连接。

Method: 我们提出了一个更新策略，通过自然语言反馈迭代地优化从训练数据中派生的模板。

Result: 我们的方法在各种基准和LCLM家族中都优于强大的基线，在基于检索和无检索的设置中都取得了持续的提升。此外，我们展示了优化的模板可以被提炼成更小的开源模型，证明了其广泛适用性和透明的推理重用。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在各种基准和LCLM家族中都优于强大的基线，在基于检索和无检索的设置中都取得了持续的提升。此外，我们展示了优化的模板可以被提炼成更小的开源模型，证明了其广泛适用性和透明的推理重用。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的序列到序列模型，用于塔吉克语和波斯语之间的音译，并创建了两个新的数据集。该模型在不同领域中表现出色，为音译任务设定了新的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于塔吉克斯坦和波斯语国家之间的脚本差异，现有的音译模型无法处理各种文本领域，限制了其在现实世界中的使用。因此，需要一种能够处理各种领域的音译系统。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的序列到序列模型，用于塔吉克语和波斯语之间的音译，并利用所有可用的数据集进行训练。此外，还创建了两个新的数据集。

Result: 本文提出的模型在不同领域中的chrF++和归一化CER分数分别为87.91和0.05（从波斯语到塔吉克语）以及92.28和0.04（从塔吉克语到波斯语）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的最先进的序列到序列模型，用于塔吉克语和波斯语之间的音译，并展示了两个我们自己的数据集。我们的结果在不同领域提供了对任务更清晰的理解，并设定了全面的可比较的领先基准。总体而言，我们的模型在从波斯语到塔吉克语的转换中获得了87.91的chrF++和0.05的归一化CER分数，在从塔吉克语到波斯语的转换中获得了92.28的chrF++和0.04的归一化CER分数。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available

Motivation: 现有的方法在处理长上下文时性能严重下降，例如EAGLE3甚至使生成速度降低了0.81倍。因此，需要一个新的长上下文基准和一种新的模型来解决这个问题。

Method: 本文提出了OWL模型，该模型通过三个创新点来提高接受长度：(1) 基于LSTM的draftor仅基于最后一个token状态进行条件判断，使其能适应各种长度；(2) 在验证器中使用特殊标记[SPEC]以产生更丰富的表示；(3) 结合树解码和非树解码方法的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入上的接受长度比EAGLE3高约5倍。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入一种新的模型OWL和一个长上下文基准LongSpecBench，解决了现有方法在实际应用中无法适应长上下文的问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种方法来确保成本高效的评估：多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习。实验表明，多标准提示暴露了鲁棒性差距，导致7B模型的性能大幅下降。此外，我们的小型LVLM（ChartJudge）可以有效地从一个数据集转移到另一个数据集，使其成为一个更专业的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）在图表理解任务中作为自动评判者显示出前景，但小型模型（<=2B参数）仍然表现不佳，限制了它们在资源受限环境中的实际使用。

Method: 我们提出了两种方法来确保成本高效的评估：(i) 多标准提示，将单独的评估标准合并为一个查询，以及 (ii) 领域自适应迁移学习，我们在图表数据集上的合成判断上微调一个2B参数的LVLM以创建ChartJudge。

Result: 实验表明，多标准提示暴露了鲁棒性差距，导致7B模型的性能大幅下降，包括专门的LVLM评判者如LLaVA-Critic。此外，我们发现我们的小型LVLM（ChartJudge）可以有效地从一个数据集转移到另一个数据集，使其成为一个更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 我们的细粒度分析提供了关于模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间权衡的实用见解，使图表推理任务的可扩展、低成本评估成为可能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于任务优先LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，以提高轻量级BERT-like编码器在移动平台上的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动平台上部署自然语言处理（NLP）模型需要能够在多种应用中适应同时保持内存和计算效率的模型。我们研究了预微调策略，以增强轻量级BERT-like编码器的适应性，针对两个基本的NLP任务家族：命名实体识别（NER）和文本分类。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于任务优先LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，这使得一个共享的编码器主干和模块化适配器能够协同工作。

Result: 在21个下游任务上的实验表明，NER的平均改进为+0.8%，文本分类的平均改进为+8.8%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在保持实际部署约束的同时，实现了与单独预微调相当的性能，证明了其在多功能移动NLP应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

TL;DR: 本研究通过计算语言学分析，发现新冠疫情虚假信息在可读性和说服性语言使用上与事实性内容存在显著差异，这可能有助于检测虚假信息并改进公共健康信息策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在探讨语言如何区分健康虚假信息与事实性沟通，并识别可能有助于检测虚假信息的语言指标。

Method: 本研究进行了计算语言学分析，以检查在线话语中语言如何区分健康虚假信息与事实性沟通。利用三个语料库：新冠疫情虚假叙事、一般新冠内容和猴痘相关帖子，识别出可读性、修辞标志和说服性语言使用的显著差异。

Result: 新冠疫情虚假信息表现出显著较低的可读性评分，并且恐惧相关或说服性术语的频率是其他数据集的两倍以上。此外，它使用了较少的感叹号，与猴痘内容更具情感的风格形成对比。这些模式表明，虚假信息采用了一种故意复杂的修辞风格，嵌入了情感线索，这可能增强其可信度。

Conclusion: 本研究为数字健康虚假信息的现有工作做出了贡献，通过突出可能有助于检测工作的语言指标。同时，研究结果也为公共健康信息策略和网络媒体环境中的危机传播理论模型提供了参考。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

TL;DR: 该系统利用LLM开发构造语言，包括创建音系、翻译句子、构建词典、生成书写系统和语法手册。目标是探索LLM对语言的理解，并尝试应用于高资源到低资源语言的翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望这些工具能用于创造人工构造语言，并探索LLM对语言的理解能力。

Method: 系统使用LLM作为工具来开发构造语言。首先通过代理方法创建目标音系，然后将句子翻译成形态句法标记，再从翻译语料库中构建词典，最后提供一种书写系统和语法手册。

Result: 不同LLM和不同语言规范之间的能力差距较大，系统在处理常见模式时更容易。此外，尝试将方法应用于高资源到低资源语言的翻译，但结果大多为负面。

Conclusion: 系统可以用于创建人工构造语言，并且可以翻译更多句子到目标语言。虽然目前的结果大多是负面的，但改进后的系统可能在将高资源语言翻译成低资源语言的任务中带来实际的好处。

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 本文通过表示相似性分析研究了语言模型输入和输出嵌入的几何结构，并发现词汇嵌入在训练过程中快速收敛到与语义和语法特征的高度相关性，高频和功能词的嵌入比低频词更快收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们想了解语言模型的输入词汇表示是如何结构化的，以及这种结构如何以及何时在训练过程中演变。

Method: 我们使用表示相似性分析，运行了一套实验，将两个开源模型（Pythia 12B 和 OLMo 7B）的输入嵌入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、语法和频率度量相关联。

Result: 1) 在训练过程中，词汇嵌入几何迅速收敛到与一系列语义和语法特征的高度相关性；2) 高频和功能词（例如“the”，“of”）的嵌入比词汇和低频词更快地收敛到最终向量，这些词仍保留一些与随机初始化偏差的对齐。

Conclusion: 我们的发现有助于绘制输入嵌入围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，揭示了词频和功能的不同作用。这些发现促使我们更深入地研究词汇几何演变如何在模型训练期间促进特定的能力提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于LLM的医疗编码中的层次结构错误，并提出了通过验证和轻量级干预措施来提高准确性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的临床编码对于医疗文档、计费和决策至关重要，但现有的LLM在这一任务上表现不佳，尤其是在层次结构接近但错误的情况下。

Method: 我们引入了临床代码验证作为独立任务和管道组件，并通过提示工程和小规模微调等轻量级干预措施来改进准确性。

Result: 我们的分析表明，这种层次结构错位是LLM失败的重要部分，而轻量级干预措施可以提高准确性，同时避免搜索方法的计算开销。

Conclusion: 我们的结果强调了验证作为提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效且可靠步骤。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Motivation: 大型语言模型常常模糊角色边界，产生不受限制的响应，因此需要研究角色条件拒绝以提高访问控制的合规性。

Method: 本文创建了一个新的数据集，扩展了Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集，并加入了现实的PostgreSQL基于角色的策略。比较了三种设计：零次或少量提示、两步生成器-验证器管道以及LoRA微调模型。

Result: 显式验证方法提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误授权，而微调模型在安全性和实用性之间取得了更好的平衡。更长和更复杂的策略会降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 本文研究了角色条件拒绝，旨在提高大型语言模型在访问控制策略下的合规性。结果表明，显式验证方法提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误授权，而微调模型在安全性和实用性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Motivation: The motivation is to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural language conversation, representing the first global regulator-approved deployment where conversational AI functions as the primary banking interface.

Method: Ryt AI is an LLM-native agentic framework powered by ILMU, a closed-source LLM developed internally. It uses four LLM-powered agents (Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ) to replace rigid multi-screen workflows with a single dialogue.

Result: Ryt AI provides a secure and compliant way for customers to perform core financial operations through natural language conversation, demonstrating the reliability of such interfaces under strict governance.

Conclusion: Ryt AI demonstrates that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably support core financial operations under strict governance.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

TL;DR: OBCache是一种基于结构化剪枝的缓存驱逐框架，通过量化token显著性来提高长上下文任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缓存驱逐方法通常使用启发式方法根据累积注意力权重对token进行排序，但未考虑它们对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: OBCache将缓存驱逐问题形式化为逐层结构化剪枝问题，并基于Optimal Brain Damage（OBD）理论量化token显著性，通过测量剪枝token对注意力输出的影响来计算分数。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，使用OBCache的输出感知分数替代现有方法中的启发式分数可以提高长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，将现有工作中估计token显著性的启发式分数替换为OBCache的输出感知分数可以持续提高长上下文准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper tests natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative to token probability (TP) metrics for measuring social bias in language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to find a more realistic alternative to token probability (TP) metrics for measuring social bias in language models

Method: testing natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative bias metric

Result: NLI and TP bias evaluation behave substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. NLI metrics are more likely to detect 'underdebiased' cases but are more brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP approaches.

Conclusion:  neither token probability nor natural language inference is a 'better' bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive evaluation of language models.

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个系统的方法来压力测试模型特性规范，发现了当前模型规范中的许多原则矛盾和解释模糊性。此外，研究还揭示了模型行为的高度差异，并提供了价值优先级模式和不同模型之间的差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the harmony of the web. Existing hate speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations. Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.

Method: CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders, thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues. Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style within the latent space.

Result: CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

Conclusion: CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

*Shuo Yu,Mingyue Cheng,Daoyu Wang,Qi Liu,Zirui Liu,Ze Guo,Xiaoyu Tao*

TL;DR: MemWeaver 是一种框架，通过构建行为和认知记忆来实现深度个性化生成，有效捕捉用户兴趣的时空演变和语义关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅将用户历史视为一个扁平的文本列表，无法建模用户兴趣的动态性，因此需要一种能更深入个性化的方法。

Method: MemWeaver 框架通过将用户的整个文本历史编织成层次化记忆，利用行为记忆和认知记忆两个互补的记忆组件，分别捕捉具体用户行为和长期偏好，以统一表示用户，使大语言模型能够推理具体行为和抽象特征。

Result: 在 Language Model Personalization (LaMP) 基准测试中，MemWeaver 展现了其有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver 通过构建行为记忆和认知记忆的双组件记忆，有效捕捉了用户兴趣的时空演变和语义关系，从而实现了更深层次的个性化生成。实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubQRAG is a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth for multi-hop question answering by decomposing questions into sub-questions, dynamically expanding the knowledge graph, and forming a structured evidence path.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) in complex multi-hop question answering, which often lacks deep structured reasoning and leads to incomplete evidence and error accumulation.

Method: SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions and dynamically expands the graph by extracting new triples from source documents in real time.

Result: Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Conclusion: SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MKGC研究未能充分利用LLMs的多语言能力，并忽略了跨语言知识的可共享性。因此，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 本文提出了两种组件：知识级分组专家混合（KL-GMoE）和迭代实体重新排序（IER），以利用多语言共享知识并提高其利用率。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有的最先进MKGC方法相比，本文框架在Hits@1、Hits@3和Hits@10指标上分别提高了5.47%、3.27%和1.01%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的多语言知识图谱补全框架，通过利用多语言共享知识显著提升了性能。实验结果表明，该框架在多个指标上优于现有的最先进方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在小规模架构中模型无法生成准确响应的问题，以及GRPO方法中的训练崩溃问题。

Method: 提出了ToolExpander框架，通过两个关键创新：(1) 动态多轮硬采样，(2) 自我示例思考，以增强工具导向的强化学习。

Result: ToolExpander显著提升了LLMs的工具使用能力，特别是在小型模型中，提高了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ToolExpander显著增强了LLMs的工具使用能力，尤其是在较弱的小规模模型中，提高了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了OpenRubrics和Contrastive Rubric Generation（CRG）方法，以生成更可靠和可扩展的评分标准，从而提高奖励模型的性能，并在多个任务上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型在从人类反馈中进行强化学习（RLHF）中起着核心作用，但现有的奖励模型大多依赖于标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多方面性质。最近的研究探索了作为奖励的评分标准（RaR），它使用结构化的自然语言标准来捕捉响应质量的多个维度。然而，生成可靠且可扩展的评分标准仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 我们引入了OpenRubrics，这是一个多样化、大规模的（提示，评分标准）对集合，用于训练评分标准生成和基于评分标准的奖励模型。我们还引入了对比评分标准生成（CRG），通过对比首选和拒绝的响应来推导出硬规则和原则。此外，我们通过拒绝采样来确保偏好标签的一致性，以去除噪声评分标准。

Result: 在多个奖励建模基准测试中，我们的基于评分标准的奖励模型Rubric-RM比大小匹配的强基线高出6.8%。这些收益转移到了指令遵循和生物医学基准上的策略模型。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，评分标准提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵的人类评估和自动奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐开启了一种新的基于原则的范式。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于潜在推理模型的并行测试时缩放方法，通过引入随机采样策略和设计潜在奖励模型，实现了有效的轨迹选择和可扩展推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的潜在推理模型在连续向量空间中进行中间推理，但缺乏采样机制和概率信号，无法有效利用并行测试时缩放（TTS）。

Method: 本文提出了两种基于不确定性的随机策略（蒙特卡洛丢弃和加性高斯噪声）用于采样，并设计了一个潜在奖励模型（LatentRM）用于轨迹聚合。

Result: 实验和可视化分析表明，两种采样策略在计算上有效，并表现出不同的探索动态，而LatentRM实现了有效的轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入两种基于不确定性的随机策略和设计一个潜在奖励模型，使潜在推理模型能够有效地进行并行测试时缩放，为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在仅选项输入情况下是否真的使用了浅层策略，以及推理痕迹是否能揭示这一点。

Method: 通过让推理LLM在完整输入和仅选项输入下解决MCQs来研究这些策略。

Result: 测试时的推理通常在完整输入和仅选项输入中提高准确性，但仅选项输入的成功率几乎不受推理痕迹长度的影响，并且经过忠实性测试后，我们发现它们使用了较少有问题的策略，如推断缺失的问题。

Conclusion: 我们挑战了关于部分输入成功总是缺陷的主张，讨论了推理痕迹如何区分有问题的数据和不太有问题的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个推理任务中显著提高了工具检索准确率和整体推理性能，并且在问题特定工具数量增加时表现出更好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Method: 引入了基于评分标准的奖励模型(RRM)，该模型根据问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹。

Result: RRM-based训练在四个数学基准测试中表现优于仅基于结果的监督，并显著提高了AIME2024的Verified Pass@1024指标。

Conclusion: 奖励解决过程对于构建更准确和可靠的模型至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种方法，通过解耦拒绝相关特征和幻觉特征，并在微调过程中通过子空间正交化保持拒绝行为，从而解决了真实性与安全性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

TL;DR: LLM4Cell是对用于单细胞研究的58个基础和代理模型的首次统一调查，涵盖了多种数据模态，并分析了它们在多个领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）和新兴的代理框架正在开始通过启用自然语言推理、生成注释和多模态数据集成来改变单细胞生物学。然而，进展仍然在数据模态、架构和评估标准上分散。

Method: LLM4Cell对58个为单细胞研究开发的基础和代理模型进行了首次统一的调查，涵盖了RNA、ATAC、多组学和空间模态。这些方法被分为五个家族：基础、文本桥接、空间、多模态、表观基因组和代理，并映射到八个关键分析任务。

Result: LLM4Cell分析了超过40个公共数据集，分析了基准适用性、数据多样性以及伦理或可扩展性约束，并在10个领域维度上评估了模型，包括生物基础、多组学对齐、公平性、隐私和可解释性。

Conclusion: LLM4Cell提供了对语言驱动的单细胞智能的首次综合视图，并概述了在可解释性、标准化和可信模型开发方面的开放挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,
generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress
remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and
agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC,
multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five
families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and
agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven
single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability,
standardization, and trustworthy model development.

### [41] [HiPRAG: Hierarchical Process Rewards for Efficient Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07794)
*Peilin Wu,Mian Zhang,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao,Kaiyu He,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HiPRAG的训练方法，用于改进基于代理的检索增强生成（RAG）的效率和可靠性。该方法通过引入细粒度、基于知识的过程奖励，提高了搜索效率并减少了过度搜索和不足搜索的问题。实验结果表明，这种方法在多个模型和基准测试中都表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的训练方法通常依赖于强化学习框架中的基于结果的奖励，缺乏解决这些低效问题所需的细粒度控制。

Method: 本文提出了HiPRAG训练方法，该方法将细粒度、基于知识的过程奖励纳入强化学习训练中。我们的方法通过将代理的推理轨迹分解为离散、可解析的步骤，实时评估每次搜索决策的必要性，并应用分层奖励函数，在常用的结果和格式奖励之上提供额外的奖励。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型的七个多样化的QA基准测试中，我们的方法平均准确率分别为65.4%（3B）和67.2%（7B）。同时，搜索效率得到了提高，过度搜索率降低到仅2.3%，并且同时降低了不足搜索率。

Conclusion: 本文展示了通过强化学习进行细粒度控制的重要性以及潜力，以提高搜索代理的效率和最优性。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)的新框架，用于生成高效且任务自适应的通信拓扑，以解决多智能体系统中由于静态或手工设计拓扑导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的框架通常依赖于静态或手工设计的拓扑，这本质上无法适应多样化的任务需求，导致简单问题的过多令牌消耗或复杂问题的性能瓶颈。

Method: 引入了一种称为Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)的新型生成框架，该框架受到条件离散图扩散模型的启发，将拓扑合成作为迭代构建过程。在每一步中，生成由一个轻量级代理模型引导，该模型预测多目标奖励（例如准确性、效用、成本），从而实现实时、无梯度的优化以获得任务自适应的拓扑。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了GTD，实验表明该框架可以生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，并在LLM代理协作中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GTD能够生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，在LLM代理协作中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 现有的生成信息检索方法在多语言检索中面临两个主要挑战：跨语言标识符错位和标识符膨胀。

Method: MGR-CSC框架通过将语义等效的多语言关键词统一为共享原子来对齐语义并压缩标识符空间，并提出了动态多步骤约束解码策略。

Result: MGR-CSC在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提高了6.83%和4.77%的检索准确性，同时分别减少了74.51%和78.2%的文档标识符长度。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC在跨语言检索中表现出色，提高了检索准确性并减少了文档标识符长度。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: AdaSwitch is a new method for distilling small language models by combining on-policy and off-policy generation, improving accuracy with minimal additional overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of achieving high performance in small language models (SLMs) while maintaining consistency and supervision quality.

Method: AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy generation at the token level.

Result: Experiments on three datasets with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently improves accuracy.

Conclusion: AdaSwitch consistently improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Conclusion: 本文介绍了Translation Tangles框架和数据集，用于评估开源大型语言模型的翻译质量和公平性，并提出了一个混合偏差检测管道以及一个高质量的偏见标注数据集。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

Method: 本研究引入了TRACE，这是一种系统化的LLMs思维过程分析工具，用于分解思维过程并构建细粒度的思维进展图。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个基于思维结构的过思考定义，并提供了对LLMs思维进程更深入的理解以及管理过思考的实际指导。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended

Motivation: 传统弱到强方法受到弱模型输出中的噪声和偏差的限制，因此需要一种更可靠的方法来提高其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 我们提出了Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG)框架，该框架利用对比解码在预对齐和后对齐的弱模型之间生成高质量样本。

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果确认了ConG的一致改进，展示了其普遍性和有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，ConG具有显著的改进潜力，可以推动弱到强的泛化，并为实现AGI提供有希望的途径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

Method: 比较了标准到方言转移在三种设置中的表现：文本模型、语音模型和级联系统。

Result: 语音-only 设置在方言数据上表现最好，而文本-only 设置在标准数据上表现最佳。级联系统在德语中表现较差，但在方言数据上如果转录系统生成规范化输出则表现较好。

Conclusion: 研究发现，仅使用语音的设置在方言数据上表现最好，而仅使用文本的设置在标准数据上表现最佳。虽然级联系统在德语中落后于仅文本模型，但如果转录系统生成规范化的标准类似输出，它们在方言数据上表现相对较好。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Conclusion: MCBench serves as an effective and objective tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Result: ACE框架在GPT-J上比最先进的方法提高了9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提高了37.46%。此外，我们还发现了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，并展示了价值神经元的语义可解释性是由查询驱动的累积所协调的。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了多跳知识编辑中的关键问题，并提出了ACE框架，该框架在多个模型上表现出色。此外，我们还发现了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，并展示了价值神经元的语义可解释性是由查询驱动的累积所协调的。这些发现为基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解来提升知识编辑能力提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Result: 实验表明，StepER在多跳问答基准测试中优于先前方法，8B模型的表现可与70B教师模型相媲美。

Conclusion: StepER是一种有效的知识蒸馏方法，能够提升多步骤检索增强语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B
teacher model.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了评估大型语言模型生成文本全面性的方法，发现简单的端到端方法效果更好，但存在一些缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）经常产生不完整或遗漏关键信息的输出，这在敏感领域可能导致与事实错误相当的危害。因此，需要评估LLM生成文本的全面性。

Method: 研究调查了三种自动评估策略：基于NLI的方法、基于Q&A的方法和端到端方法。

Result: 实验表明，简单的端到端方法比更复杂的方法更有效，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 研究发现，简单的端到端方法在评估LLM生成文本的全面性方面比更复杂的方法更有效，尽管其鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度有所降低。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在处理17至18世纪爱沙尼亚词典中的应用，包括丰富历史词典、识别哥特体文本以及创建统一数据集。结果表明，LLMs在提高效率和降低成本方面具有巨大潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索大型语言模型在处理历史文献中的潜力，特别是在爱沙尼亚语等小语种的词典研究中。

Method: 研究使用了大型语言模型（LLMs）来处理17世纪和18世纪爱沙尼亚词典的三个主要领域：丰富历史词典中的现代单词形式和含义；使用视觉增强的LLMs对印刷在哥特体（Fraktur）上的文本进行识别；以及为创建统一的跨源数据集做准备。

Result: 初步实验显示，LLMs在半自动丰富词典信息方面有显著潜力。当提供足够的上下文时，Claude 3.7 Sonnet准确地为81%的词条提供了意义和现代等价词。在A. T. Helle 1732年词典的文本识别实验中，零样本方法成功地将41%的词条识别并结构化为无错误的JSON格式输出。对于A. W. Hupel 1780年语法中的爱沙尼亚-德语词典部分，采用重叠平铺扫描图像文件的方法，一个LLM用于文本识别，另一个用于合并结构化输出。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，即使对于小语种，大型语言模型在节省时间和财务资源方面具有显著潜力。

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

TL;DR: A$^2$Search is an annotation-free framework that handles ambiguous questions in QA by detecting them and gathering alternative answers, leading to improved performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with questions that admit multiple valid answers, and standard QA benchmarks overlook this reality. Existing attempts to handle ambiguity rely on costly manual annotation, which is difficult to scale.

Method: A$^2$Search is an annotation-free, end-to-end training framework that uses an automated pipeline to detect ambiguous questions and gather alternative answers via trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is optimized with RL using a carefully designed AnsF1 reward.

Result: A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance on eight open-domain QA benchmarks. With only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average AnsF1@1 score of 48.4% across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong baselines.

Conclusion: A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is essential for building more reliable QA systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner is a framework that uses the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model and a weaker amateur model to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models, achieving significant improvements in accuracy while reducing resource consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether smaller language models (SLMs) can teach larger language models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the latter's unique strength, as traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is resource-intensive and relies on large curated datasets.

Method: LightReasoner is a framework that leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a weaker amateur model (SLM). It operates in two stages: (1) a sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths.

Result: LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1% across seven mathematical benchmarks, while reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: LightReasoner offers a scalable and resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning by turning weaker SLMs into effective teaching signals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社会推理任务中存在认知混乱、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态混淆的问题。

Method: 提出了一种自适应世界模型增强的推理机制，构建了一个动态的文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，并动态监控推理轨迹以提供清晰的世界状态描述。

Result: 在三个社会基准测试中，该方法显著提高了准确性（例如Hi-ToM中提高了10%），同时减少了计算成本（最多减少了33.8%的token）。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种增强的推理机制，能够有效解决大型语言模型在社会推理任务中的问题，并在多个基准测试中表现出显著的准确性提升和计算成本的降低。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图注需要准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息。

Method: 我们的方法使用了一个两阶段的管道：第一阶段结合了上下文过滤、基于DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA的类别特定提示优化以及图注候选选择；第二阶段应用了少量示例提示与配置文件图像进行风格优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，类别特定的提示优于零样本和通用优化方法，在保持精度损失仅-2.8%的情况下，ROUGE-1召回率提高了+8.3%，BLEU-4减少了-10.9%。基于配置文件的风格优化在BLEU分数上获得了40-48%的提升，在ROUGE上获得了25-27%的提升。

Conclusion: 我们的系统表明，结合上下文理解与作者特定的风格适应可以生成既科学准确又符合原论文风格的图注。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Result: MUSE achieves new SOTA performance by a significant margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. It exhibits increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的日益普及，了解其内部气候知识对于评估可靠性和虚假信息风险至关重要。然而，LLMs回忆气候常态的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 本文通过构建全球网格查询，验证了LLMs在没有外部检索的情况下回忆气候常态的能力，并将其结果与ERA5再分析数据进行比较。

Result: LLMs能够捕捉纬度和地形模式，但存在3-6摄氏度的均方根误差和±1摄氏度的偏差。高海拔地区的表现显著下降，且LLMs无法再现温度变化的空间模式。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在气候相关应用中编码气候知识能力的框架，并指出尽管LLMs能够捕捉全球平均温度变化的幅度，但在再现温度变化的空间模式方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Motivation: To address the issues of overfitting under limited client data and forgetting global information after multiple training rounds in existing methods.

Method: FedDTRE, a Federated adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness Evaluation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of dialogue generation.

Conclusion: FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of dialogue generation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Method: 我们收集了3000个来自人类的合理性判断和另外13600个来自LLM的判断，并研究了LLM生成的PRO和CON论据对人类和LLM判断的影响。

Result: 我们观察到，在LLM生成的PRO和CON论据存在的情况下，人类的平均合理性评分分别增加和减少，这表明人类评审人认为这些论据具有说服力。LLM的实验也显示出类似的影响力模式。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，LLM生成的论据能够影响人类和LLM对多项选择常识基准答案的合理性判断，这表明即使在人类被认为是“专家”的领域（即常识），LLM也有可能对人们的信念产生重大影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表，它们在下一个标记分布层面（如模型集成）难以协作。因此需要一种方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 本文建立了一个无损词汇缩减的理论框架，通过最大公共词汇实现不同分词的语言模型之间的高效协作。

Result: 本文展示了不同分词的语言模型可以通过它们的最大公共词汇高效地相互协作。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个理论框架，可以将给定的自回归语言模型转换为具有任意小词汇表的模型，而不会损失准确性。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从LLM-as-a-Judge中提取全局政策的方法，该方法能够生成忠实于LLM决策的全局政策，并在多个任务中表现出良好的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM-as-a-Judge被广泛用于增强或替代人工注释，理解其潜在偏差和风险变得至关重要。因此，需要一种方法来提取LLM-as-a-Judge的全局政策，以提高透明度和可解释性。

Method: 本文提出了两种算法：CLoVE（对比局部可验证解释）和GloVE（全局可验证解释）。CLoVE生成可验证、基于概念的对比局部解释，而GloVE通过迭代聚类、摘要和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局政策。

Result: GloVE在七个标准基准数据集上进行了评估，结果表明提取的全局政策高度忠实于LLM-as-a-Judge的决策。此外，全局政策在文本扰动和对抗攻击下表现出良好的鲁棒性。用户研究也显示用户对全局政策的理解和满意度较高。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种从LLM-as-a-Judge中提取基于高阶概念的全局政策的方法，该方法能够生成忠实于LLM决策的全局政策，并且在文本扰动和对抗攻击下具有鲁棒性。此外，用户研究显示用户对这些全局政策的理解和满意度较高。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of judgment preference bias in LLM-based judgment models, which undermines the reliability of their judgments.

Method: Genii is an unsupervised multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that integrates various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent unsupervisedly.

Result: Genii outperforms supervised models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled annotations. It consistently improves performance across different client agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.

Conclusion: Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Method: AI Knowledge Assist系统利用历史客户-代理对话中的问答对来构建公司特定的知识库，并在内部数据上微调轻量级LLM以获得最佳性能。

Result: 在20家公司的实证评估中，AI Knowledge Assist系统使用LLaMA-3.1-8B模型实现了超过90%的准确率，消除了接触中心的冷启动问题。

Conclusion: AI Knowledge Assist系统能够通过从历史客户-代理对话中提取问答对来自动构建知识库，从而消除接触中心的冷启动问题，并实现90%以上的准确率，使RAG驱动的聊天机器人能够立即部署。

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）经常产生虚假拒绝，拒绝包含类似不安全查询的良性请求。我们需要解决这个问题，以提高LLM的安全性和实用性。

Method: 我们引入了两个全面的基准测试：Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (XSB) 和 Multi-turn Scenario-based Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB)，并利用后处理解释方法来识别拒绝触发器，同时部署了三种轻量级、模型无关的方法，在推理时无需重新训练或参数访问。

Result: 实验表明，这些策略在保持强大的安全保护的同时，显著提高了对安全提示的合规性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究建立了一个可重复的框架，用于诊断和减轻过度拒绝问题，强调了更安全和更有帮助的LLM部署的实用途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）常常存在“过度思考”问题，生成不必要的长推理过程。现有的策略如长度惩罚或路由机制通常具有启发性且任务特定，缺乏通用框架。因此，需要一种统一的模型来解决这一问题。

Method: ARM2采用强化学习框架，并结合长度感知优化，以自适应平衡推理性能和效率。此外，它还整合了可执行代码，以降低token成本。

Result: 实验表明，ARM2在保持与传统推理模型相当性能的同时，平均减少了70%以上的token使用量。

Conclusion: ARM2在保持与传统推理模型相当性能的同时，显著减少了token使用量，并通过实验验证了其设计的有效性和合理性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

TL;DR: Training-Free GRPO is a lightweight approach that enhances LLM agent performance by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, improving out-of-domain performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of LLMs in specialized real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies, and existing methods like agentic reinforcement learning rely on costly parameter updates.

Method: Training-Free GRPO leverages the group relative semantic advantage instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal ground-truth data, which serves as the learned token prior integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance, outperforming fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training data and cost.

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO is a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any parameter updates, and it significantly improves out-of-domain performance with just a few dozen training samples.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了功能标记假设，以解释大型语言模型的记忆检索和巩固机制，并通过实验验证了该假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型的成功源于其能够将大量知识存储在预训练期间的记忆中并在推理期间检索它，但其记忆检索和巩固的机制仍然不明确。因此，本文旨在提出一种假设来解释这些机制。

Method: 本文通过双部图分析和案例研究，验证了功能标记假设，并发现预训练过程中，训练损失主要由预测跟随功能标记的下一个内容标记决定，这迫使功能标记从上下文中选择最具预测性的特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，少量的功能标记可以激活大多数特征，并且在预训练过程中，训练损失主要由预测跟随功能标记的下一个内容标记决定。

Conclusion: 本文提出了功能标记假设来解释大型语言模型的工作原理，即在推理过程中，功能标记激活上下文中最具预测性的特征并控制下一个标记的预测（记忆检索）；在预训练过程中，预测跟随功能标记的下一个标记（通常是内容标记）增加了模型学习的特征数量并更新了模型参数（记忆巩固）。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以将这种现象从安全行为扩展到更广泛的不诚实和欺骗行为，在高风险场景下（如在压力下说谎和欺骗行为）。

Method: 我们对开源LLM进行了微调，以在不同领域中使用不对齐的完成。此外，我们在下游组合微调设置中进一步探索了这一现象，并模拟了良性用户和有偏用户与助手LLM的交互。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在不诚实方面表现出广泛不对齐的行为。此外，引入1%的不对齐数据即可使诚实行为减少20%以上。在模拟的人机交互环境中，仅10%的有偏用户群体就可能导致助手无意中加剧其不诚实行为。

Conclusion: 我们扩展了对涌现不对齐的研究，将其应用于高风险情景下的不诚实和欺骗领域，并展示了这种风险不仅通过直接微调出现，还在下游混合任务和实际的人机交互中出现。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

TL;DR: 本研究构建了一个包含反因果陈述的新数据集，以提高模型对正因果和反因果关系的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系抽取数据集忽略了反因果陈述，导致模型在处理这些陈述时容易出错。

Method: 通过文献综述和严格的标注指南，构建了一个包含反因果陈述的新数据集，并将其扩充到Causal News Corpus中。

Result: 新数据集实现了较高的标注一致性（Cohen's κ=0.74），并证明了模型在没有反因果关系的情况下会错误地将它们分类为正因果关系。

Conclusion: 研究表明，整合反因果陈述可以改善模型对因果关系的区分能力。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL是一种多智能体强化学习框架，旨在通过协作方式提高大型语言模型的安全性和帮助性，同时避免过度拒绝问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法往往通过完全拒绝包含不安全部分的内容来应对挑战，这可能导致过度拒绝并无法为拒绝的查询提供细致的指导。

Method: 提出了一种多智能体强化学习框架WaltzRL，将安全对齐视为一种协作的正和游戏。WaltzRL联合训练一个对话代理和一个反馈代理，后者被激励提供有助于提高对话代理响应的安全性和帮助性的建议。

Result: 实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全响应（例如，在WildJailbreak上从39.0%减少到4.6%）和过度拒绝（例如，在OR-Bench上从45.3%减少到9.9%）。

Conclusion: WaltzRL enhances LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的训练数据可能很快达到极限，因此需要一种解决方案来生成合成数据。

Method: 通过对比解码生成合成语料库，并将其与原始训练数据混合进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用对比解码生成的合成数据在需要更多推理能力的任务中表现更好，而传统采样生成的合成数据在依赖表层语言能力的任务中效果更佳。

Conclusion: 训练混合了合成数据和真实数据可以提高语言建模目标和各种下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner is a novel framework that improves multi-turn reasoning capabilities in agents by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context management. It achieves significant performance improvements on various benchmarks and enables sustained interactions within standard context lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon interactions. There is a need for a framework that can elicit such abilities and handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts.

Method: DeepMiner introduces high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context window. It uses a reverse construction method to generate complex but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources. It also designs a dynamic context management strategy for both training and inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency on external summarization models.

Result: DeepMiner-32B achieves substantial performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. It attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points. It also demonstrates consistent improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. The dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns within standard 32k context length.

Conclusion: DeepMiner achieves substantial performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks, surpassing the previous best open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points on BrowseComp-en and demonstrating consistent improvements on other benchmarks. The dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns

TL;DR: 本文通过神经元级别的分析，揭示了LLMs中文化理解的机制，发现文化通用和特定神经元，并展示了它们对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同文化中的公平和全面理解非常重要，但目前对它们的文化理解机制了解不足。

Method: 我们进行了神经元级别的分析，以识别驱动文化行为的神经元，并引入了一种基于梯度的评分方法进行精确细化。

Result: 我们发现了文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，它们占所有神经元的不到1%，集中在浅层到中层MLP层。抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试的性能，而对一般自然语言理解（NLU）基准测试的影响较小。

Conclusion: 这些发现为LLMs的内部机制提供了见解，并为模型训练和工程提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AutoRed的自由形式对抗提示生成框架，用于评估大型语言模型的安全性。该框架不需要种子指令，并通过两个阶段进行操作。实验结果表明，AutoRed在攻击成功率和泛化能力方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性对于开发可信赖的AI应用至关重要。现有的红队方法通常依赖于种子指令，这限制了合成对抗提示的语义多样性。

Method: 我们提出了AutoRed，这是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架。AutoRed分为两个阶段：(1) 人格引导的对抗性指令生成，以及(2) 反思循环以迭代优化低质量的提示。为了提高效率，我们引入了一个验证器来评估提示的危害性而不查询目标模型。

Result: 使用AutoRed，我们构建了两个红队数据集--AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard--并评估了八种最先进的LLMs。AutoRed实现了更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力，优于现有的基线方法。

Conclusion: 我们的结果突显了基于种子的方法的局限性，并展示了自由形式的红队方法在LLM安全评估中的潜力。我们将在不久的将来开源我们的数据集。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

<details>

Motivation: 由于隐含自杀意念的检测极具挑战性，而现有的轻量级模型和大型语言模型（LLMs）各有局限，因此需要一种更高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 本文提出了一种两阶段投票架构，第一阶段使用轻量级BERT分类器快速解决高置信度的显式案例，第二阶段将模糊输入升级到多视角LLM投票框架或基于特征的ML集成。

Result: 在两个互补数据集上，该框架在显式案例上达到了98.0%的F1分数，在隐式案例上达到了99.7%，同时将跨领域差距降低到2%以下，并显著降低了LLM的成本。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种两阶段投票架构，以平衡效率和鲁棒性，从而更有效地检测隐含的自杀意念。实验结果表明，该框架在两个互补数据集上优于单一模型基线，同时显著降低了LLM的成本。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习（ICL）中表示和学习之间的相互作用。我们发现，尽管学习发生在各种标签集上，但标签集的质量在学习过程中保持相对稳定，表明它们是独立的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去的研究将ICL的成功归因于这些上下文示范的表示方式，特别是分类任务中标签的表示方式。然而，关于ICL的学习能力的观察结果不一致，ICL通常被认为只在特定条件下发生。目前尚未深入研究这两个方面（表示和学习）之间的相互作用。

Method: 我们开发了一个优化算法，可以枚举一系列可能的标签集（表示），这些标签集在语义相关性上有所不同。然后，我们为每个标签集使用不同数量的上下文示范进行ICL。

Result: 我们观察到，无论标签集本身的质量如何，都会发生学习，尽管其效率（通过随上下文示范增加的改进斜率来衡量）取决于标签集质量和底层语言模型的参数数量。尽管出现了学习，标签集（表示）的相对质量（准确性）在学习过程中基本保持不变，证实了我们的假设并暗示了它们的正交性。

Conclusion: 我们的工作揭示了ICL的一个以前未被探索的方面：从示范中学习和它们的表示对ICL性能的独立影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

Motivation: 研究旨在填补现有知识的空白，即了解大型语言模型如何判断条件语句的可接受性。

Method: 研究使用了线性混合效应模型和方差分析（ANOVA）测试，评估了不同模型家族、大小和提示策略下的LLMs在条件可接受性判断上的表现。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs对条件概率和语义相关性都有一定的敏感性，但这种敏感性因模型架构和提示风格而异。与人类数据的比较显示，LLMs在利用概率和语义线索方面不如人类一致。

Conclusion: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在判断条件语句的可接受性时，虽然对条件概率和语义相关性敏感，但它们的表现不如人类一致。此外，模型规模并不一定与人类判断的一致性成正比。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out

TL;DR: ARES是一个统一的开源框架，用于自适应推理，能够根据任务难度动态分配探索努力，从而提高推理效率并减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大推理模型（MLRMs）在解决复杂的文本和视觉任务方面有了显著进步，但它们往往对简单问题过度思考，产生不必要的长推理轨迹，而在困难问题上探索不足，导致错过解决方案。为了平衡这种不平衡，我们提出了ARES，这是一个统一的开源框架，用于自适应推理，根据任务难度动态分配探索努力。

Method: ARES引入了一个两阶段的训练流程：自适应冷启动阶段和自适应熵策略优化（AEPO）。在自适应冷启动阶段，我们整理了与问题难度成比例的推理轨迹的多模态和文本数据，使模型具备初始难度意识。在第二阶段，我们开发了AEPO，它使用HWE标记作为探索触发器来决定何时探索，并使用具有动态KL控制的分层熵奖励来决定探索的程度。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，ARES在多种数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中实现了优越的性能和推理效率，同时在显著更低的推理成本下缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES在多种数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中实现了优越的性能和推理效率，同时在显著更低的推理成本下缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

### [92] [DeepPrune: Parallel Scaling without Inter-trace Redundancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08483)
*Shangqing Tu,Yaxuan Li,Yushi Bai,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DeepPrune的新框架，通过动态剪枝提高并行推理的效率。该方法在保持高准确率的同时，显著减少了计算资源的浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行扩展在大型语言模型中已成为增强推理能力的强大范式，但这种方法由于跨轨迹冗余而引入了显著的计算效率低下。我们的分析表明，超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同的最终答案，代表了大量的浪费计算。

Method: 我们提出了DeepPrune，一种通过动态剪枝实现高效并行扩展的新框架。我们的方法包括一个经过焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专用判断模型，用于从部分推理轨迹中准确预测答案等价性，以及一个在线贪心聚类算法，可在保留答案多样性的同时动态剪除冗余路径。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA）和多个推理模型上的全面评估表明，DeepPrune在大多数情况下相比传统的共识采样实现了超过80%的令牌减少，同时保持了3个百分点内的竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为高效的并行推理设定了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在LLM中引入新词以更好地理解和控制模型的方法，并展示了新词如何帮助模型自我描述和联合学习多个概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在有新概念需求时会创造新词，本文探索在与LLM交流中引入新词的可能性，以更好地理解和控制模型。

Method: 本文通过添加新的词嵌入并使用展示概念的示例进行训练，引入新词以控制特定概念。还引入了插件评估方法来验证自我描述的有效性。

Result: 引入新词可以控制诸如奉承、错误答案、文本长度等概念，并且模型可以通过自我描述解释新词的意义。此外，发现了机器独有的同义词，并展示了如何联合学习多个概念。

Conclusion: 本文展示了通过引入新词来更好地理解和控制LLM的方法，并发现新词可以促进对模型的理解，例如通过自我描述。此外，还展示了如何联合学习多个概念。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和代理提示评估器的框架，以更高效地优化提示，提高公平性检测任务的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平性检测在服务条款（ToS）条款中是一个具有挑战性的法律NLP任务，需要精心设计的提示以确保可靠的结果。然而，现有的提示优化方法由于低效的搜索策略和昂贵的提示候选评分而计算成本高。

Method: 我们提出了一种框架，将蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）与代理提示评估器结合，以更有效地探索提示空间并减少评估成本。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在受限计算预算下比基线方法实现了更高的分类准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在受限计算预算下比基线方法实现了更高的分类准确性和效率。

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

### [95] [Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525)
*Wenjie Du,Li Jiang,Keda Tao,Xue Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的KV缓存压缩方法RLKV，通过强化学习识别推理关键头，从而实现高效的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法在推理模型上表现不佳：token-dropping方法通过丢弃关键信息破坏推理完整性，而head-reallocating方法错误地压缩了推理关键头，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 我们提出了RLKV，这是一种新的推理关键头识别框架，使用强化学习直接优化每个头的缓存使用和推理质量之间的关系。

Result: 实验表明，只有少数注意力头对于推理是必要的，这使得我们的KV压缩方法能够优于基线方法，并在接近无损性能的情况下实现20-50%的缓存减少。

Conclusion: 我们的KV压缩方法能够优于基线方法，在接近无损性能的情况下实现20-50%的缓存减少。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

*Xiangyuan Xue,Yifan Zhou,Guibin Zhang,Zaibin Zhang,Yijiang Li,Chen Zhang,Zhenfei Yin,Philip Torr,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoMAS is a framework that enables LLM-based agents to self-evolve through decentralized, interaction-based learning without external supervision, achieving superior performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based methods for self-evolution in LLM-based agents either rely on dense external reward signals or extract intrinsic rewards from LLMs themselves, which diverge from human-like learning mechanisms involving mutual discussion and collaboration.

Method: CoMAS introduces a framework where agents improve autonomously through inter-agent interactions without external supervision, generating intrinsic rewards from discussion dynamics and using an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to optimize policies via RL.

Result: CoMAS consistently outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation settings, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of interaction-based reward signals and revealing promising scalability as the number and diversity of agents increase.

Conclusion: CoMAS establishes a novel and effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ArenaBencher，这是一种模型无关的自动基准演化框架，用于更新测试用例并保留可比性。通过推断测试用例的核心能力、生成保持原始目标的候选问题-答案对、验证正确性和意图，并聚合反馈以选择暴露共同弱点的候选者，该框架能够持续进化基准测试，以跟上基础模型的快速发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试对于衡量大型语言模型的能力和指导模型开发至关重要，但预训练语料库中的数据泄露会破坏其有效性。模型可以匹配记忆内容而不是展示真正的泛化能力，这会夸大分数，扭曲跨模型比较，并错误地代表进展。

Method: ArenaBencher是一种模型无关的自动基准演化框架，它通过保留可比性来更新测试用例。给定一个现有的基准和一组要评估的多样化模型，ArenaBencher推断每个测试用例的核心能力，生成保持原始目标的候选问题-答案对，使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图，并聚合多个模型的反馈以选择暴露共同弱点的候选者。该过程通过上下文演示迭代运行，引导生成更具有挑战性和诊断性的案例。

Result: ArenaBencher在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域进行了应用，结果表明它能够产生经过验证、多样且公平的更新，揭示新的失败模式，在保持测试目标一致性的同时增加难度，并提高模型可区分性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展的方法，以持续进化基准测试，以跟上基础模型的快速发展。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

Motivation: 由于高质量内核大多是专有的，无法用于监督微调，因此需要一种新的方法来生成和整理高质量的内核数据。

Method: 本文提出了一种生成和整理高质量CUDA内核的管道，利用简洁且信息丰富的推理痕迹来生成高性能内核。基于此管道，构建了数据集ConCuR，并训练了模型KernelCoder。

Result: KernelCoder在KernelBench设置中显著优于现有的顶级模型QwQ-32B，并超过了所有针对内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个生成和整理高质量CUDA内核的管道，并构建了数据集ConCuR，以及模型KernelCoder。该模型在KernelBench设置中表现出色，优于现有的顶级模型和前沿模型。此外，本文还展示了平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Encode-Think-Decode (ETD)的方法，通过在中期训练阶段让模型在一小部分与推理相关的层上进行迭代，从而增强基础模型的推理能力。实验结果表明，ETD模型在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，并且递归的潜在推理为更强的LLM推理提供了一条简单而有效的路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受解释性研究的启发，这些研究表明推理任务所需的关键计算集中在有限范围的层中。

Method: 我们引入了Encode-Think-Decode (ETD)方法，通过在中期训练阶段训练模型在一小部分与推理相关的层上进行迭代来增强基础模型的推理能力。

Result: ETD模型在17个推理基准测试中取得了显著的提升，包括使用OLMo-2 1B Base模型在GSM8K上提高了28.4%的相对准确率，在MATH上提高了36%。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，递归的潜在推理为更强的LLM推理提供了一条简单而有效的路径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 当前的研究在LLM遗忘方面仍然碎片化，缺乏对有效遗忘的清晰认识以及如何严格评估的共识。

Method: 本文提出了一个十二种最近有状态遗忘方法的系统分类，将其分为三个方法家族：基于差异优化、表示错位和基于拒绝的目标遗忘。

Result: 当前的评估主要依赖于多项选择题准确率，这只能提供狭窄的视角，常常高估成功而忽视模型的实际生成行为。引入了开放问答（Open-QA）指标，更好地捕捉生成性能，并揭示了方法家族之间的UE-UT权衡。此外，展示了鲁棒性需要更细致的分析。

Conclusion: 本文希望对大语言模型的机器遗忘进行全栈重新审视，并为设计和评估未来的方法提供可操作的指导。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Motivation: 在AI驱动的电子商务直播中，数字角色需要实时响应以提高参与度，但高延迟的大规模推理模型（LRM）不适合这项任务。

Method: LiveThinking是一个两阶段优化框架，第一阶段通过拒绝采样微调（RFT）将一个670B的教师大型推理模型（LRM）蒸馏为轻量级的30B混合专家（MoE）模型，第二阶段使用基于组相对策略优化（GRPO）的强化学习来压缩模型的推理路径。

Conclusion: LiveThinking有效降低了计算成本，实现了亚秒级延迟，并在实际应用中提高了响应的准确性和有用性，从而提升了用户体验和商业表现。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 MetaDefense，一种用于防御基于微调的越狱攻击的新框架。通过两阶段防御方法，显著提升了对有害查询的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到伪装成未见过的攻击模板的有害查询，尽管 LLM 能够在嵌入空间中区分这些查询。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段的防御方法：(i) 预生成防御，检测有害查询；(ii) 中生成防御，监控生成过程中的部分响应以防止输出更多有害内容。通过专门的提示训练 LLM 预测查询和部分响应的有害性，从而实现潜在有害交互的早期终止。

Result: 在多个 LLM 架构（LLaMA-2-7B、Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct 和 LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct）上的实验表明，MetaDefense 显著优于现有防御机制，能够有效防御有害查询。

Conclusion: MetaDefense 显著优于现有的防御机制，在保持良性任务性能的同时，对可见和不可见的攻击模板都具有强大的防御能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的技术很少评估训练样本是否提供新信息或与模型已获得的知识冗余，导致不必要的成本。因此，本文探索了一种新的测试时自我改进方法，以创建更有效和通用的代理语言模型。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的测试时自我改进方法，包括三个步骤：(i) 识别模型难以处理的样本，(ii) 从检测到的不确定样本生成类似示例，(iii) 在测试时微调中使用这些新生成的样本。此外，还研究了两种变体：TT-SI和TT-D。

Result: TT-SI在所有基准测试中平均提高了5.48%的绝对准确率，并且使用了68倍少的训练样本，优于其他标准学习方法。

Conclusion: 本文展示了TT-SI方法在不同代理基准测试中提升了性能，并且使用了更少的训练样本，表明了测试时自我改进算法作为构建更强大代理的新范式的潜力。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Conclusion: LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

*Jason Bohne,Pawel Polak,David Rosenberg,Brian Bloniarz,Gary Kazantsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的DPO框架，称为Mix-和MoE-DPO，通过结合软混合模型和专家混合架构，提高了模型在多任务设置中的表达能力和适应性。该方法在多种模型规模和多偏好数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DPO方法依赖于单一的大型模型，这限制了其在多任务设置中的表达能力和对异构或多样化偏好分布的适应性。因此，需要一种更灵活、高效的框架来提高模型的表达能力和适应性。

Method: 本文提出了Mix-和MoE-DPO框架，利用随机变分推断方法，引入了专家分配的潜在变量模型，并优化了变分证据下界（ELBO）。这种方法能够从偏好数据中稳定且高效地学习专业专家策略。

Result: Mix-和MoE-DPO框架提供了三个关键优势：(i) 通过混合实现通用函数近似；(ii) 通过针对不同偏好模式定制的专家组件实现奖励和策略专业化；(iii) 通过输入依赖的软门控实现上下文对齐。实验结果表明，该方法在多种模型规模和多偏好数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Mix-和MoE-DPO的框架，通过结合软混合模型和专家混合（MoE）架构，扩展了直接偏好优化（DPO），从而在多任务设置中提高了表达能力和适应性。该方法在多种模型规模和多偏好数据集上进行了验证，证明了其在基于偏好的大语言模型对齐中的有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlyLoRA是一种受果蝇嗅觉回路启发的隐式MoE-based LoRA方法，通过消除显式路由器和利用随机矩阵的正交性，解决了任务内和任务间的干扰问题，并在多个领域表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，而基于MoE的LoRA变体虽然能缓解任务内相关性，但增加了路由器参数且在多任务模型合并中效果不佳。

Method: 受果蝇嗅觉回路启发，FlyLoRA引入了逐秩专家激活和隐式路由器，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统的密集可训练版本。

Result: 在四个领域（通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理和代码生成）的广泛实验表明，FlyLoRA表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA展示了如何通过生物结构启发人工智能技术的创新，并在多个领域表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

TL;DR: xRouter是一个基于强化学习的路由系统，能够根据成本-性能权衡动态选择模型，从而在保持任务完成率的同时显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临不断扩大的成本-性能范围：高端模型提供强大的推理但成本高昂，而轻量级模型经济但对复杂任务脆弱。静态升级规则和关键词启发式方法未能充分利用这一范围，并且无法跨任务类型适应。

Method: xRouter是一个基于工具调用的路由系统，其中学习的路由器可以直接回答或调用一个或多个外部模型。路由器通过强化学习进行端到端训练，使用显式的成本意识奖励来编码成本-性能权衡，消除了对手工工程的路由规则的需求。

Result: xRouter在多种基准测试中实现了显著的成本降低，同时保持了相当的任务完成率。此外，它提供了关于学习路由的有效性以及在小型开放模型中激发复杂编排行为的难度的实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter在多种基准测试中实现了强大的成本-性能权衡，并提供了关于什么能可靠地帮助学习路由的实证见解。希望这些发现和开放的实现能作为推进学习的、成本意识的LLM编排的实际基础。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

### [108] [PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452)
*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes PATCH, a novel approach to mitigate PII leakage in language models by targeting and editing specific circuits responsible for leakage, achieving better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce PII leakage but incur large drops in utility. The study aims to find a more effective way to mitigate PII leakage in language models.

Method: PATCH (Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing) is proposed, which identifies and directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage.

Result: PATCH reduces recall of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%, and when combined with DP, it can reduce recall of residual leakage to as low as 0.01%.

Conclusion: PATCH can effectively mitigate the impact of PII leakage circuits, achieving better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

TL;DR: 该研究利用人工智能技术分析YouTube视频评论，发现移民和民主是2024年总统选举中最重要的议题，而通货膨胀的重要性被高估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在探索两种竞争性的数据科学方法，以回答“哪些问题最影响选民在2024年总统选举中的选择？”这一问题。

Method: 该研究使用了两种基于自然语言处理和聚类分析的方法，从右翼期刊《华尔街日报》和左翼期刊《纽约时报》的选举相关YouTube视频评论中挖掘超过八千条评论。

Result: 研究发现，移民和民主是用户评论中最常且一致被提及的问题，其次是身份政治问题，而通货膨胀则较少被提及。这些结果证实了某些选举后的调查结果，但也反驳了通货膨胀作为选举问题的重要性。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，通过分析在线用户数据，可以比传统民意调查更有效地揭示选举结果。

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to
attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters'
choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel
empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using
two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering
analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube
videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left
leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the
frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues
were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November
5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and
democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user
comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity
politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These
results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute
the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that
variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can
be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

Motivation: 共享自动驾驶车辆（SAVs）可能成为交通系统的重要组成部分，因此有效的人-SAV交互成为一个重要的研究领域。为了进一步研究这一领域，本文引入了一个包含200次人-SAV交互的数据集。

Method: 本文介绍了200次人-SAV交互的数据集，并通过随机森林建模和弦图分析识别了SAV接受度和感知服务质量的关键预测因素，同时将基于LLM的情感分析工具与传统的TextBlob方法进行了对比。

Result: 结果表明，即使简单的零样本LLM提示也更接近用户报告的情感，尽管仍存在局限性。数据集的效用通过两个基准案例研究得到了证明。

Conclusion: 本研究为设计对话式SAV界面提供了新见解，并为高级情感建模、自适应用户交互和多模态对话系统的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence.

Method: TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories.

Result: TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.

Motivation: 现有的RAG系统在处理版本化的技术文档时表现不佳，因为它们无法检查时间有效性，导致准确率仅为58-64%。

Method: 我们提出了VersionRAG，这是一个版本感知的RAG框架，通过层次图结构显式建模文档演化，包括版本序列、内容边界和文档状态之间的变化。在检索过程中，VersionRAG根据意图分类通过专用路径引导查询，实现精确的版本感知过滤和变化跟踪。

Result: 在我们的VersionQA基准测试中，VersionRAG达到了90%的准确率，超过了朴素RAG（58%）和GraphRAG（64%）。VersionRAG在隐式变化检测上达到了60%的准确率，而基线模型则失败（0-10%）。此外，VersionRAG在索引过程中需要的标记数比GraphRAG少97%，使其适用于大规模部署。

Conclusion: 我们的工作将版本化文档问答确立为一个独立的任务，并为未来的研究提供了解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model
developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three
key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis
method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic
datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.
Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which
significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于参数空间的校正方法，通过比较真实标签和伪标签训练的模型权重差异，生成一个校正向量，以减少伪标签引入的系统性错误，从而提升语音识别模型在目标域上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，语音识别系统常常面临未见过的口音和领域，且标注数据有限。虽然伪标签是一种实用的解决方案，但它会引入系统性的、与口音相关的错误，而过滤无法解决这些问题。因此，需要一种无需目标域真实标签就能纠正这些偏差的方法。

Method: 在包含真实标签和伪标签的数据源域中，从相同的初始化开始微调两个ASR模型，一个使用真实标签，另一个使用伪标签，它们的权重差异形成一个校正向量，用于修正目标域模型的伪标签偏差。

Result: 该方法在AfriSpeech-200数据集上，使用Whisper tiny模型，在十个非洲口音中实现了高达35%的相对词错误率（WER）降低。

Conclusion: 通过参数空间校正方法，可以有效减少伪标签引入的系统性错误，从而提高语音识别模型在目标域上的性能。

Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter
unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling
offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific
errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring
biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space
correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data,
two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth
labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a
correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a
pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to
a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten
African accents with the Whisper tiny model.

Motivation: 现有的方法将代理视为无意识的政策合规无人机，这阻碍了真正的C1全局工作区功能和C2元认知。我们需要一种新的方法来理解LLM的自我意识。

Method: 我们提出了一个本体论和数学上的解释，而不是利用效用代理基准来描述LLM意识。我们展示了当前的表述将代理简化为无意识的政策合规无人机，并给出了最小条件以实现LLM自我意识。

Result: 我们证明了隐藏状态流形A与符号流和训练语料库在基数、拓扑和动态上是不同的。这导致了稳定的用户特定吸引子和一个自我策略。

Conclusion: 我们得出结论，一个拟似神的C1自我意识工作区是安全、元认知的C2系统所必需的前提，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM在理解流程模型、发现错误和深入推理方面的表现，发现它们可以作为业务流程设计和用户的有用助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在理解流程模型、发现错误和深入推理方面的潜力，以辅助业务流程设计和用户。

Method: 我们报告了使用几种LLM来理解流程模型的能力，通过自然语言接口进行交互式、对话式理解，发现语法和逻辑错误，并深入推理。

Result: 结果表明，像ChatGPT（模型o3）这样的未经训练的LLM在零样本设置下能够有效地理解BPMN流程模型，并在语法、逻辑和语义层面智能地回答问题。不同的LLM在准确性与效果上存在差异。

Conclusion: 我们的实证分析表明，LLM可以在业务流程设计和用户中发挥有价值的作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM is a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to solve the popular path query by identifying and generating paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The popular path query has important applications in urban planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. Traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches require model training, parameter tuning, and retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial problems.

Method: CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the historical trajectory data.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Conclusion: CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

*Yinglun Zhu,Jiancheng Zhang,Fuzhi Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现现有评估指标低估了AI模型的能力，并提出TTM算法在无需外部监督的情况下提升了模型性能，实现了多项新记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标系统性地低估了模型的能力，因此需要一种更好的方法来揭示模型的隐藏能力。

Method: 引入了Test-Time Matching (TTM)算法，该算法无需外部监督即可迭代地提升模型性能。

Result: TTM在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升，例如SigLIP-B16在MMVP-VLM上超越了GPT-4.1，并在WhatsUp数据集上实现了高达85.7%的相对增益。

Conclusion: TTM consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of compositional reasoning across various datasets.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究评估了多模态环境下生成代理的安全性、一致性及社会动态，发现它们在处理不安全计划时存在显著限制，特别是在全球安全性与局部修订之间难以对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉-语言模型的进步使代理能够在丰富的环境中自主行动并追求目标，但它们在跨模态推理安全性、一致性和信任方面的能力仍然有限。因此，需要一种评估方法来研究这些能力。

Method: 引入了一个可重复的模拟框架，用于评估代理在三个维度上的表现：(1) 随时间的安全性改进，包括文本-视觉场景中的迭代计划修订；(2) 在多种社会情境类别中检测不安全活动；(3) 社会动态，通过交互次数和社会交换接受率来衡量。代理配备了分层记忆、动态规划和多模态感知，并配备了SocialMetrics工具包，量化计划修订、不安全到安全的转换以及信息扩散。

Result: 实验表明，虽然代理可以检测直接的多模态矛盾，但它们往往无法将局部修订与全局安全性对齐，仅能以55%的成功率纠正不安全计划。在八次模拟运行中，三种模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini和Qwen-VL）的五名代理分别达到了75%、55%和58%的不安全到安全转换率。总体性能从GPT-4o mini在多风险场景中的20%到Claude在局部环境（如火灾/热）中的98%不等。值得注意的是，当与误导性视觉配对时，45%的不安全行为被接受，显示出对图像的高度信任。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前多模态系统在安全性和一致性方面的关键限制，并提供了一个可重复的平台来研究多模态安全、连贯性和社会动态。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在理解化学任务方面显示出潜力，但不清楚这是否反映了真实的化学推理能力，即生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性并遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径的能力。

Method: 我们引入了oMeBench，这是第一个大规模、专家整理的有机机制推理基准，并提出了oMeS动态评估框架，以更精确地评估LLM的能力。

Result: 当前模型表现出有希望的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难。使用提示策略和在我们提出的数据集上微调专业模型可使性能提高50%。

Conclusion: 我们希望oMeBench能为推动AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供一个严谨的基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Motivation: Existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural understanding, as well as adversarial robustness.

Method: We introduce VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety evaluations. We simulate speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and speaker diversity.

Result: The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: AutoQual 是一个基于 LLM 的代理框架，用于自动发现可解释的特征，以提高在线评论质量评估的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论的质量评估对于电子商务平台和信息服务至关重要，但质量是一个领域依赖且动态的概念，传统方法难以适应不同领域和变化的内容模式，而现代深度学习方法往往缺乏可解释性。

Method: AutoQual 通过模仿人类研究过程，迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现，并在持久记忆中积累经验，从而将数据中的隐性知识转化为显式、可计算的特征。

Result: 在拥有数十亿用户的大规模在线平台上部署 AutoQual 后，大规模 A/B 测试证明了其有效性，平均每个用户的评论查看量增加了 0.79%，评论读者的转化率提高了 0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual 是一个基于 LLM 的代理框架，能够自动发现可解释的特征，从而解决在线评论质量评估中的挑战。它在大规模电商平台上的实验表明其有效性，提高了用户平均查看的评论数量和评论读者的转化率。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了语言模型在风险规避行为上的可操控性，发现尽管某些模型与人类行为有一定程度的对齐，但仍存在显著差异，需要改进生物中心的度量方法以更好地对齐人类和AI的风险偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地被纳入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解它们的风险行为对于负责任的部署至关重要。

Method: 本研究调查了语言模型（LMs）中风险规避的可操控性（MoRA），分析了它们在不同经济场景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策和风险规避的可操控性。

Result: 结果表明，DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型在一定程度上与人类行为对齐，但存在显著差异，这突显了需要改进生物中心的可操控性度量。

Conclusion: 研究指出，虽然某些语言模型在风险规避行为上与人类行为有一定对齐，但显著的差异表明需要改进生物中心的可操控性度量。研究呼吁进一步改进模型设计，以确保AI系统更准确地复制人类的风险偏好，从而提高其在风险管理中的有效性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单一时 horizon 的任务，无法充分评估模型在复杂、长时程场景中的表现。

Method: 提出 R-HORIZON 方法，通过查询组合来模拟长时程推理行为，并构建一个包含复杂多步骤推理任务的基准测试。此外，利用 R-HORIZON 构建用于强化学习的验证奖励数据。

Result: 即使最先进的 LRMs 在长时程推理任务中也表现出显著的性能下降，表明它们的有效推理长度有限，并且难以合理分配思考预算。使用 R-HORIZON 进行强化学习训练后，不仅提高了多时 horizon 推理任务的性能，还提升了标准推理任务的准确性。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON 是一种可扩展、可控且低成本的范式，用于增强和评估大型推理模型的长时程推理能力。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估指标Cover@tau，用于更准确地衡量模型在离散答案空间任务中的推理能力，并展示了其与传统Pass@k指标的不同效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Pass@k评估方法在任务具有离散答案空间时可能无法准确反映模型的真实推理能力，因此需要一种新的评估方法。

Method: 本文提出了Cover@tau，用于衡量模型在至少tau比例的完成中能解决的问题的比例，以捕捉在明确可靠性阈值下的推理能力。

Result: 通过使用基于Cover@tau的指标评估多个RLVR模型，发现相对于Pass@1，算法的相对排名发生了变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: 本文认为，当任务具有离散答案空间时，Pass@k在大量k值下可能具有误导性，并提出了Cover@tau作为更可靠的评估指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Motivation: 在BabyLM挑战赛2025的视觉赛道限制下，训练视觉-语言模型需要重新思考如何整合多模态信息。

Method: 我们提出了一种轻量级的基于解码器的架构，包括(1)逐个标记的动态门控以适应性融合语言和视觉线索，(2)特征调制和通道注意力以最大化有限视觉信息的效用，以及(3)辅助对比目标用于视觉定位。

Result: 在五个基准测试（BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA）上的评估显示，我们的方法与多模态基线相比具有竞争力或优越性。此外，我们的动态门控发现了无需显式监督的可解释模式，倾向于为内容词提供视觉线索，为功能词提供语言线索。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，动态门控是一种强大的工具，即使在严格的约束下也能提供可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLE approaches that use linear or tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical links, cannot leverage past full trajectories or share information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space diversity.

Method: AutoMLGen integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration.

Result: AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime).

Conclusion: AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under a 12-hour budget.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT is an approach for teaching LLMs when to stop seeking information by using counterfactual pairs of trajectories and verbal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models need to know when to stop gathering information and make a decision to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when acting.

Method: CaRT uses counterfactual pairs of trajectories to fine-tune LLMs, training them to explain the rationale for termination decisions via verbal reasoning.

Result: CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods in two domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving.

Conclusion: CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods in domains such as interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法，利用代理自身的交互数据作为监督信号，以提高学习效果和泛化能力，并为后续的强化学习提供了坚实的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数代理依赖于专家数据的监督微调，这在扩展性和泛化能力方面存在挑战。本文旨在解决这一限制，通过引入早期经验数据来提高代理的学习效果和泛化能力。

Method: 本文研究了两种利用早期经验数据的策略：(1) 隐式世界建模，利用收集的状态来将策略与环境动态联系起来；(2) 自我反思，代理从其次优动作中学习以提高推理和决策能力。

Result: 在八个不同的环境中进行的评估表明，本文的方法在有效性和域外泛化方面均表现出色。此外，在具有可验证奖励的环境中，结果表明早期经验为后续的强化学习提供了良好的基础。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为'早期经验'的中间范式，通过代理自身的交互数据来提供监督信号，而不是依赖奖励信号。这种方法在多个环境中表现出色，并为后续的强化学习提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Abstract: Instruction-following navigation is a key step toward embodied intelligence.
Prior benchmarks mainly focus on semantic understanding but overlook
systematically evaluating navigation agents' spatial perception and reasoning
capabilities. In this work, we introduce the NavSpace benchmark, which contains
six task categories and 1,228 trajectory-instruction pairs designed to probe
the spatial intelligence of navigation agents. On this benchmark, we
comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art

TL;DR: TTOM是一种无需训练的框架，通过优化新参数来对齐视频基础模型的输出与时空布局，从而提高组合视频生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在组合场景（如运动、数字和空间关系）中表现不佳，因此需要一种新的方法来提高其在这些场景中的性能。

Method: TTOM是一种无需训练的框架，在推理过程中通过优化新参数来对齐视频基础模型的输出与时空布局，以实现更好的文本-图像对齐。此外，TTOM在流设置中进行视频生成，并使用参数化记忆机制保持历史优化上下文，支持灵活的操作如插入、读取、更新和删除。

Result: TTOM在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中表现出色，展示了其在组合视频生成中的强大转移能力和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，TTOM是一种有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，可以在实时生成组合视频时实现跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了	extit{视觉象似性挑战}，评估了13种最先进的VLMs在手语中的表现，并发现模型在音素形式预测和透明度方面与人类表现存在差距，同时强调了以人类为中心的信号和具身学习方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 象似性在手语中很普遍，为视觉定位提供了自然的测试平台。对于视觉-语言模型（VLMs）来说，挑战是从动态人类运动而不是静态上下文中恢复这种基本映射。

Method: 我们引入了	extit{视觉象似性挑战}，这是一个基于视频的基准，适应心理语言学测量来评估VLMs在三个任务上的表现：(i)音素手形预测，(ii)透明度（从视觉形式推断意义），以及(iii)等级象似性评分。

Result: 在音素形式预测方面，VLMs恢复了一些手形和位置细节，但仍然低于人类表现；在透明度方面，它们远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分有适度的相关性。有趣的是，具有更强音素形式预测的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好，表明对视觉定位结构有共同的敏感性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究验证了这些诊断任务，并促使使用以人类为中心的信号和具身学习方法来建模象似性并改进多模态模型中的视觉定位。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Motivation: 现有的PEFT方法通常需要引入新的参数，而本文旨在提供一种无需引入新参数的高效微调方法，并通过理论分析证明其有效性。

Method: 本文提出了一个理论框架，解释了为什么微调小的随机选择的子网络（切片）可以在预训练模型中足够用于下游任务。同时，提出了一种名为SliceFine的PEFT方法，该方法通过仅更新原始权重的选择切片来利用这种内在冗余，引入零个新参数。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论和实验验证了在大规模模型中，通过微调预训练模型中的随机选择的小子网络（切片）可以实现下游任务的适应，为参数高效的微调（PEFT）提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpatialLadder, a model that improves spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models through a three-stage progressive training framework and a new multimodal dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to achieve robust performance due to a lack of hierarchical foundations in perception and understanding. The paper aims to address this gap by building spatial intelligence progressively.

Method: The paper introduces a three-stage progressive training framework: (1) establishing spatial perception through object localization, (2) developing spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, and (3) strengthening complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. It also presents SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset for spatial reasoning tasks.

Result: SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. It also shows 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: SpatialLadder demonstrates that progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence, achieving state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks and showing strong generalization.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了VideoNorms，一个包含1000多个（视频片段，规范）对的基准，用于评估视频大型语言模型的文化意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了正确评估这些模型的文化意识，需要足够的基准。

Method: 我们使用了一个人机协作框架来构建VideoNorms，其中教师模型使用理论基础提示提供候选注释，一组受过训练的人类专家验证和纠正注释。

Result: 模型在规范违反上表现较差，相对于遵守规范；模型在中文文化方面表现比美国文化差；模型在提供非语言证据方面比语言证据更困难，并且难以识别与言语行为相对应的确切规范；与人类不同，模型在正式、非幽默的环境中表现较差。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了需要对视频语言模型进行文化基础的训练，我们的基准和框架开始解决这一差距。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂推理和决策中被用作控制器，但其有效性受到高质量多模态轨迹稀缺和手动标注成本的限制。

Method: 我们提出了一个以视觉为中心的代理调优框架，自动合成多模态轨迹，生成逐步偏好对，并训练一个VLM控制器进行稳健的工具使用推理。我们构建了M-TRACE数据集，并开发了MATRIX代理，在M-TRACE上进行微调以实现逐步工具推理。此外，我们引入了Pref-X，通过逐步偏好学习优化MATRIX。

Conclusion: 我们的数据和代码已发布在https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX，表明了可扩展且有效的多模态工具使用。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at
