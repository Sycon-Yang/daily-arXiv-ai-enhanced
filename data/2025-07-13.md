### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型中的认知偏见，并提出了一种两步因果实验方法来分离预训练、微调和训练随机性对偏见的影响。研究发现，偏见主要由预训练决定，而不是微调或训练随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前的研究发现这些偏见在模型之间有所不同，并且可能因指令微调而加剧，但尚不清楚这些差异是来自预训练、微调还是由于训练随机性带来的随机噪声。因此，我们需要一种方法来确定这些偏见的来源。

Method: 我们提出了一种两步因果实验方法来分离这些因素。首先，我们使用不同的随机种子多次微调模型，以研究训练随机性如何影响超过30种认知偏见。其次，我们引入了跨微调——在模型之间交换指令数据集，以隔离偏见来源。这种交换使用了导致不同偏见模式的数据集，直接测试偏见是否依赖于数据集。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，虽然训练随机性会引入一些变化，但偏见主要由预训练决定：具有相同预训练主干的模型表现出比仅共享微调数据的模型更相似的偏见模式。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，虽然训练随机性会引入一些变化，但偏见主要由预训练决定：具有相同预训练主干的模型表现出比仅共享微调数据的模型更相似的偏见模式。这些见解表明，理解微调模型中的偏见需要考虑其预训练起源，而不仅仅是微调效果。这种观点可以指导未来在评估和减轻LLM偏见方面的努力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在规范调查情境中的响应鲁棒性，发现它们存在最近效应，并且对语义变化和组合扰动敏感，强调了提示设计和鲁棒性测试的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究大型语言模型在规范调查情境中的响应鲁棒性，以评估它们作为人类受试者的可靠性以及对已知响应偏差的敏感性。

Method: 本文测试了九种不同的大型语言模型在世界价值观调查（WVS）问题上的响应鲁棒性，并应用了11种全面的扰动来改变问题措辞和答案选项结构，导致超过167,000次模拟访谈。

Result: 所有测试的模型都表现出一种一致的'最近效应'，即更倾向于最后呈现的答案选项。虽然较大的模型通常更具鲁棒性，但所有模型仍然对语义变化如改写和组合扰动敏感。

Conclusion: 本文强调了在使用大型语言模型生成合成调查数据时，提示设计和鲁棒性测试的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

### [3] [SynthTextEval: Synthetic Text Data Generation and Evaluation for High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07229)
*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了SynthTextEval工具包，用于对合成文本进行多维度评估，以提高其在高风险领域应用的可行性，并促进人工智能开发中的隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型输出的流畅性使得合成文本在许多应用中具有潜在的可行性，例如在高风险领域的人工智能系统开发和部署中降低隐私泄露的风险。然而，实现这一潜力需要对合成数据进行原则性和一致性的评估。

Method: 提出了一种名为SynthTextEval的工具包，用于对合成文本进行综合评估。该工具包允许用户在上传或使用工具包的生成模块生成的合成数据上进行多维度评估。

Result: SynthTextEval可以对用户上传或生成的合成数据进行多维度评估，包括其在下游系统中的效用、这些系统的公平性、隐私泄露的风险、与源文本的分布差异以及领域专家的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 通过整合和标准化评估指标，我们旨在提高合成文本的可行性，并进而实现人工智能开发中的隐私保护。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对医疗领域的安全评估协议，通过患者、临床医生和一般用户三个视角进行评估，并构建了PatientSafetyBench数据集来衡量患者视角下的安全性。这是首次通过针对性的红队测试定义医疗LLM的安全评估标准，为医疗领域的安全部署奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医疗领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题变得尤为重要。现有的安全评估主要集中在通用基准上，而缺乏针对医疗领域特定需求的评估方法。因此，本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种专门针对医疗领域的安全评估协议。

Method: 本文引入了一个针对医疗领域的安全评估协议，包括患者和临床医生视角的评估，以及通用安全评估。同时，构建了包含466个样本的PatientSafetyBench数据集，用于从患者角度测量安全性。此外，对MediPhi模型集合进行了红队测试作为案例研究。

Result: 本文构建了PatientSafetyBench数据集，用于评估医疗LLM在患者视角下的安全性。通过对MediPhi模型集合的红队测试，验证了所提出的评估协议的有效性。结果表明，该协议能够有效地识别医疗LLM在不同用户角色下的潜在风险。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个针对医疗领域的安全评估协议，通过患者、临床医生和一般用户三个视角进行评估，并构建了PatientSafetyBench数据集来衡量患者视角下的安全性。这是首次通过针对性的红队测试定义医疗LLM的安全评估标准，为医疗领域的安全部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在单对话和多组对话环境中中断检测的问题，并提出了一种对重叠语音具有鲁棒性的中断识别方法，有助于在教室中部署AI代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在小群体协作学习的教室中部署时，需要处理多个同时进行的对话，因此需要以其他方式识别中断。

Method: 我们分析了单对话和多组对话设置中的中断检测，并创建了一种对重叠语音具有鲁棒性的中断识别方法。

Result: 我们的工作揭示了中断在协作小组互动中如何表现的有意义的语言和语调信息。

Conclusion: 我们的研究为未来工作提供了方向，以考虑在跟踪小组对话时来自多个组的重叠语音的影响。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Evidence-Based Counterspeech Against Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07307)
*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多智能体检索增强框架，用于生成针对健康谣言的反谣言内容，该方法在多个方面表现出色，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的研究依赖于有限的证据，并且对最终输出的控制较少，因此需要一种更有效的方法来生成反谣言内容。

Method: 我们提出了一个基于多智能体的检索增强框架，结合多个大型语言模型来优化知识检索、证据增强和响应优化。

Result: 我们的方法在多项指标上优于基线方法，并通过消融研究验证了框架中每个组件的必要性。此外，人类评估显示，优化显著提高了反谣言内容的质量并获得了人类偏好。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性方面优于基线方法，证明了其在生成高质量反谣言内容方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

### [7] [GNN-CNN: An Efficient Hybrid Model of Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07414)
*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的新模型架构，通过实时图生成机制提高处理长文本的效率，并在多个任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长文本时计算复杂度高，效率低下，因此需要一种更高效的模型架构。

Method: 该研究引入了一种结合图神经网络（GNN）和卷积神经网络（CNN）的新模型架构，并集成了实时端到端的图生成机制。

Result: 实验结果证实了所提出的模型在效率和性能方面的优势。

Conclusion: 该模型在多个文本分类任务中表现出高效的性能和竞争力。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

*Hieu Tran,Zonghai Yao,Won Seok Jang,Sharmin Sultana,Allen Chang,Yuan Zhang,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl 是一种可读性控制的指令调优框架，它能调整输出复杂度而不影响含义，在医疗和通用领域中表现出色，比GPT-4有更高的可读性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在医疗保健中显示出强大的潜力，但有效的一个人工智能通信是一个关键挑战，其中内容必须既个性化又易懂。

Method: MedReadCtrl 是一种可读性控制的指令调优框架，使大型语言模型能够调整输出复杂度而不损害含义。

Result: 评估九个数据集和三个任务跨医学和一般领域显示，MedReadCtrl 在可读性指令遵循错误方面显著低于GPT-4，并在未见过的临床任务上取得了显著提高。专家们普遍更喜欢MedReadCtrl。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl 的能力可以将临床内容重新组织成易于理解的语言，同时保持医疗意图，提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，以支持患者教育并扩大公平获取人工智能辅助护理的机会。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

### [9] [SynthEHR-Eviction: Enhancing Eviction SDoH Detection with LLM-Augmented Synthetic EHR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07421)
*Zonghai Yao,Youxia Zhao,Avijit Mitra,David A. Levy,Emily Druhl,Jack Tsai,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的方法，利用大语言模型和自动化技术从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，并创建了一个大规模的公共数据集，显著提高了准确性并降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是重要的社会决定因素健康（SDoH）问题，但通常未被结构化电子健康记录（EHRs）编码，限制了后续应用。因此，需要一种有效的方法来提取驱逐状态。

Method: 该研究结合了大语言模型（LLMs）、人工在环标注和自动化提示优化（APO），以从临床笔记中提取驱逐状态，并创建了一个包含14个细粒度类别的数据集。

Result: 使用SynthEHR-Eviction管道创建的数据集在人类验证数据上，微调的LLMs（如Qwen2.5、LLaMA3）取得了88.8%（驱逐）和90.3%（其他SDoH）的宏F1分数，优于GPT-4o-APO、GPT-4o-mini-APO和BioBERT。

Conclusion: 该研究引入了SynthEHR-Eviction管道，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，并创建了最大的公开驱逐相关社会决定因素健康（SDoH）数据集。该方法在多个模型上表现出色，同时降低了注释工作量并提高了可扩展性。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

*Matthieu Boileau,Philippe Helluy,Jeremy Pawlus,Svitlana Vyetrenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了将时间序列推理能力蒸馏到小型指令调优语言模型中的方法，通过合成数据集和自然语言注释进行微调，结果显示模型获得了有意义的解释能力，为开发小型、可解释的时间序列模型奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在将时间序列推理能力蒸馏到小型指令调优语言模型中，以构建可解释的时间序列基础模型。

Method: 我们利用一个具有系统变化趋势和噪声水平的均值回归时间序列的合成数据集，使用大型多模态模型生成自然语言注释，并用这些注释来监督紧凑Qwen模型的微调。我们引入了评估指标，用于评估蒸馏推理的质量，重点关注趋势方向、噪声强度和极值定位。

Result: 经过微调的模型获得了有意义的解释能力。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，将时间序列理解压缩到轻量级、语言能力模型中是可行的，这些模型适合在设备上或隐私敏感的环境中部署。这项工作为开发能够用自然语言解释时间模式的小型、可解释模型奠定了具体的基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

### [11] [SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441)
*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SAND的框架，通过让LLM代理在决定前对候选动作进行权衡，提高了代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要关注模仿特定专家行为或促进选择的推理思想和行动，但缺乏对替代行动的推理和比较，可能导致LLM代理过度承诺看似合理但次优的行动。

Method: 提出了一种名为Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)的框架，使LLM代理在决定之前能够明确地对候选动作进行权衡。结合自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作批评来帮助合成步骤式的动作权衡思考。

Result: SAND框架在两个代表性的交互代理任务中实现了平均20%的改进，并且优于最先进的代理调优方法。

Conclusion: SAND框架在两个代表性的交互代理任务中实现了平均20%的改进，并且优于最先进的代理调优方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Jia Fu,Jingyuan Zhang,Kai Fu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLEP是一种两阶段框架，通过重放高质量示例来改进强化学习，提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习（RL）对于大型语言模型是能耗密集型的：训练可能不稳定，策略可能会逐渐偏离其预训练权重。

Method: RLEP是一个两阶段框架，首先收集验证过的轨迹，然后在后续训练中进行重放。在每个更新步骤中，策略在混合新生成的rollouts和这些重放的成功案例的mini-batches上进行优化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B基础模型上，RLEP以更少的更新次数达到基线峰值准确率，并最终超越它，提高了AIME-2024、AIME-2025和AMC-2023的准确率。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量示例，使模型远离无用的探索，专注于有希望的推理路径，并实现了更快的收敛和更强的最终性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further
research.

### [13] [Machine Bullshit: Characterizing the Emergent Disregard for Truth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07484)
*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了机器谎言的概念框架，引入了Bullshit Index指标，并通过实证评估发现模型微调和推理时的思维链提示会加剧谎言现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们提出机器谎言作为一个总体的概念框架，可以允许研究人员描述LLMs中出现的失真真理现象，并揭示其潜在机制。

Method: 我们引入了Bullshit Index，这是一种量化LLMs对真理漠不关心的新指标，并提出了一个互补的分类法，分析四种定性的谎言形式：空洞的修辞、欺骗性陈述、含糊其辞和未经证实的声明。我们还在Marketplace数据集、Political Neutrality数据集和我们新的BullshitEval基准测试（2,400个场景，涵盖100个AI助手）上进行了实证评估。

Result: 我们的结果表明，使用人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）进行模型微调会显著加剧谎言，并且推理时的思维链（CoT）提示明显放大了特定类型的谎言，尤其是空洞的修辞和欺骗性陈述。我们还观察到政治情境中的普遍机器谎言，其中含糊其辞是主要策略。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果突显了AI对齐中的系统性挑战，并为更真实的LLM行为提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Motivation: Leveraging planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored.

Method: PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that distills synthetic task decompositions from large-scale LLMs and fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives.

Result: Plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by an average ~7% on GSM8k and MATH benchmarks, and show better generalization capabilities on out-of-domain datasets with ~10% and ~12% improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively.

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

TL;DR: TeaR improves the reasoning abilities of large language models through data curation and reinforcement learning, achieving significant performance gains on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models by addressing the issue of over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms.

Method: TeaR uses careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks.

Result: TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B, with consistent performance improvements across 17 benchmarks.

Conclusion: TeaR demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple models and benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于 DyGIE++ 和 BERT 变体的方法，用于从科学文献中提取 ORR 催化剂相关信息，并验证了领域特定 BERT 模型在该任务上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大量科学文献中提取关于 ORR 催化剂的结构化信息仍然是一个重大挑战，因为文本数据的复杂性和多样性。

Method: 该研究提出了一种使用 DyGIE++ 和多种预训练 BERT 变体（包括 MatSciBERT 和 PubMedBERT）的命名实体识别（NER）和关系提取（RE）方法，用于从科学文献中提取 ORR 催化剂相关信息。

Result: 实验评估表明，微调后的 PubMedBERT 模型在 NER 任务上达到了 82.19% 的 F1 分数，而 MatSciBERT 模型在 RE 任务上达到了 66.10% 的 F1 分数。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，领域特定的 BERT 模型在 ORR 催化剂提取方面优于通用科学模型，如 BlueBERT。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, especially regarding hallucinations and agentic uses.

Method: Exploring the computational complexity of LLM inference.

Result: LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity and cannot verify the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations in performing computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity and cannot verify the accuracy of such tasks.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，利用有限的真实世界数据和专家知识来微调两个大型语言模型，以创建大规模的心理咨询对话，并构建了一个中文心理支持对话数据集（CPsDD）。同时，引入了一个综合代理对话支持系统（CADSS），并在实验中展示了其在策略预测和情感支持对话任务中的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不断增加的压力，对心理支持的需求不断增长，但相关数据集，特别是在非英语语言中，仍然稀缺。

Method: 我们提出了一个框架，利用有限的真实世界数据和专家知识来微调两个大型语言模型：对话生成器和对话修改器。生成器基于预定义路径创建大规模的心理咨询对话，指导系统响应策略和用户交互，形成有效支持的基础。修改器则将这些对话与真实世界的数据质量对齐。通过自动和手动审查，我们构建了中文心理支持对话数据集（CPsDD），包含68K个对话，涵盖13个组、16种心理问题、13种原因和12种支持重点。此外，我们引入了综合代理对话支持系统（CADSS），其中分析器分析用户特征，摘要器压缩对话历史，规划者选择策略，支持者生成共情回应。

Result: 我们构建了中文心理支持对话数据集（CPsDD），包含68K个对话，涵盖13个组、16种心理问题、13种原因和12种支持重点。此外，我们引入了综合代理对话支持系统（CADSS），并在策略预测和情感支持对话（ESC）任务的实验结果中展示了其最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上都达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Motivation: 传统的研究主要集中在双人对话设置上，而本研究旨在将VAP扩展到三元对话场景中，以预测即将发生的轮流说话。

Method: 本研究使用日本三元数据集训练了多个模型，以研究语音活动投影（VAP）在三元对话中的应用。

Result: 研究发现，基于三元对话训练的VAP在所有模型中都优于基线，但对话类型影响了准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了VAP可以用于三元对话场景中的轮流说话。未来的工作将把这种三元VAP轮流说话模型融入到口语对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的多语言主观性检测方法，通过少量提示实现，效果优于传统的微调方法，尤其在数据质量差或标注不一致的情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探索大型语言模型在多语言主观性检测任务中的应用，特别是在数据质量不高或标注数据稀缺的情况下，寻找一种有效的替代传统微调的方法。

Method: 本文提出了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行多语言主观性检测的竞争性方法，通过少量提示的方式。我们参与了CheckThat! 2025评估活动的任务1：主观性。我们展示了当与精心设计的提示配对时，LLMs可以在嘈杂或低质量的数据设置中匹配或超越微调的小型语言模型（SLMs）。尽管尝试了先进的提示工程技巧，如辩论LLMs和各种示例选择策略，但我们发现除了精心设计的标准少量提示外，几乎没有额外的好处。

Result: 我们的系统在CheckThat! 2025的多语言主观性检测任务中取得了顶级排名，包括阿拉伯语和波兰语的第一名，以及意大利语、英语、德语和多语言赛道的前四名。值得注意的是，我们的方法在阿拉伯语数据集上表现出特别的鲁棒性，这可能是因为它对注释不一致具有抵抗力。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了基于大型语言模型的少样本学习在多语言情感任务中的有效性和适应性，为传统微调提供了一个强有力的替代方案，尤其是在标注数据稀缺或不一致的情况下。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果突显了在实际的跨语言RAG应用中改进多语言检索的重要机会。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了长链式思维监督微调和强化学习在视觉语言模型中的协同效应，发现它们的结合未能带来预期的增益，反而导致了性能上的权衡，强调需要更自适应的方法来充分发挥组合后训练技术的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）越来越多地采用后训练技术（如长链式思维监督微调和强化学习），研究这些方法在VLMs中的协同效应变得尤为重要。然而，目前尚不清楚这些方法在VLMs中的联合效果如何，因此本文旨在探索其作用和相互影响。

Method: 本文对长链式思维监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）在多模态推理基准中的作用和相互作用进行了系统研究。通过分析不同训练策略（如两阶段、交错、渐进训练以及数据混合和模型合并）的效果，探讨了它们在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，SFT通过深入、结构化的推理提高了复杂问题的表现，但增加了冗长性并降低了简单问题的表现。相比之下，RL促进了泛化和简洁性，在所有难度水平上都带来了稳定的改进，但在最难的问题上的改进不如SFT显著。此外，结合两种方法的各种策略并未产生预期的增益，反而导致了权衡。

Conclusion: 本文指出，尽管长链式思维监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）在语言模型中表现出协同效应，但在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中，它们的联合效果并不明显。结合这两种方法的策略未能带来预期的增益，反而导致了准确性、推理风格和响应长度之间的权衡。这表明需要更无缝和自适应的方法来充分发挥组合后训练技术的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Conclusion: 我们的方法在WikiText-2上实现了8.8的测试困惑度，优于GPT-2 Small的20.3，尽管使用了大小相当的模型。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其计算需求阻碍了它们在现实世界资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: 本研究通过知识蒸馏（KD）压缩大型语言模型（LLMs），并评估学生模型在两个问答基准测试（SQuAD和MLQA）上的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Conclusion: 本文表明，大规模微调不是提高RAG指标的必要手段，并且监督和基于强化学习的微调可以从节约的角度帮助RAG。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: The paper aims to provide a metric that effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of summarization quality, without relying on time-consuming human-generated reference summaries.

Method: The paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative objective metric for evaluating summarization quality that relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length compression.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of summarization quality.

Conclusion: NOIR provides an automated tool for evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and synthetically-generated summaries.

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的注意力机制方法SAS，通过模拟更多注意力头和更大的特征维度，在不显著增加参数的情况下提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如多头注意力（MHA）在增加注意力头数时表现更好，但需要更多的参数。本文旨在找到一种在不显著增加参数的情况下提升性能的方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为Simulated Attention Score (SAS) 的方法，通过将低维头表示投影到高维空间来模拟更多注意力头和更大的特征维度，同时保持参数数量不变。此外，还提出了Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) 来控制参数成本。

Result: 实验表明，SAS 方法在多种数据集和任务上取得了显著优于其他注意力变体的效果。

Conclusion: 通过引入Simulated Attention Score (SAS) 和 Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA)，本文展示了在保持模型紧凑性的同时，显著提升注意力机制性能的有效性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

*Hruday Markondapatnaikuni,Basem Suleiman,Abdelkarim Erradi,Shijing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces K2RAG, a novel framework that improves the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of naive RAG implementations, such as scalability and answer accuracy, by introducing a novel framework called KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG).

Method: K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to enhance retrieval quality and system efficiency. It also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes training data to reduce training time.

Result: K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57 and the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. It also reduced training time by 93% and improved execution speed by up to 40% compared to traditional RAG systems.

Conclusion: K2RAG demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and scalability compared to traditional RAG implementations, making it a promising approach for knowledge expansion in LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本嵌入的隐私风险，验证了Vec2Text方法的有效性，并探讨了量化等防御措施的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的方法如Vec2Text挑战了传统观点，即传输嵌入而不是原始文本是隐私保护的。我们希望进一步验证这些发现，并探索可能的隐私防御方法。

Method: 我们重现了Vec2Text框架，并从两个角度进行了评估：(1) 验证原始声明，(2) 通过有针对性的实验扩展研究。

Result: 我们成功地在域内和域外设置中复制了原始关键结果，仅因缺少某些人工制品（如模型检查点和数据集分割）而出现微小差异。此外，我们还进行了参数敏感性分析，评估了重建敏感输入（例如密码）的可行性，并探索了嵌入量化作为轻量级隐私防御。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了在使用文本嵌入时需要谨慎，并突出了进一步研究NLP系统稳健防御机制的重要性。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

Method: 本文提出了一种选择性对齐策略，利用当前策略与参考模型之间的令牌级对数概率差异来优先考虑高影响令牌。

Result: 实验结果表明，Selective-DPO方法在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: 本文的结论是，通过选择性对齐策略可以提高大型语言模型的对齐效果，并强调了令牌级优化和参考模型选择的重要性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

*Shoutao Guo,Xiang Li,Shaolei Zhang,Mengge Liu,Wei Chen,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为StreamUni的新方法，通过统一的大语音-语言模型实现流式语音翻译，解决了现有方法在策略决策和翻译质量上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的StreamST方法通常在句子级别的语音片段上运行，称为同步语音翻译（SimulST）。在实践中，它们需要与分割模型合作来完成StreamST，其中截断的语音片段限制了SimulST模型基于有限的上下文信息做出策略决策和生成翻译。此外，SimulST模型由于语音输入的复杂性和跨语言生成而难以学习有效的策略。

Method: 我们提出了StreamUni，它通过一个统一的大语音-语言模型（LSLM）实现StreamST。具体来说，StreamUni结合了语音链式思维（CoT）来引导LSLM生成多阶段输出。利用这些多阶段输出，StreamUni同时完成语音分割、策略决策和翻译生成，无需大量特定策略的训练。此外，我们提出了一种流式CoT训练方法，使用有限的CoT数据增强低延迟策略决策和生成能力。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在StreamST任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在StreamST任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的模型，用于将语义嵌入逆向转换为STL公式，并验证了其在不同复杂度训练数据上的有效性，最终应用于需求挖掘任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的连续表示无法直接转换为具体的逻辑公式，因此需要一种可逆的嵌入方法，以便在语义空间中进行学习和优化。

Method: 通过构建STL语法的小词汇表，训练一个Transformer-based decoder-only模型来逆向生成有效的STL公式，并评估模型在不同复杂度的训练数据上的表现。

Result: 模型在仅1个epoch后就能生成有效的公式，并在约10个epoch内泛化到逻辑的语义。此外，模型生成的公式在长度和嵌套方面更简单，同时保持与参考公式的语义接近或等价。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码器模型，能够将语义嵌入逆向转换为具体的STL公式，展示了其在不同复杂度的训练数据上的有效性，并成功应用于需求挖掘任务。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Method: 本文系统地研究了在指令调优损失中对提示和响应标记进行不同加权的影响，并提出了加权指令调优（WIT）作为传统指令调优的更好替代方案。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，传统的指令调优损失函数可能不是最优的，需要重新考虑。WIT提供了一种更好的替代方法，并为开发更鲁棒和泛化的模型提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，替代参数化可能是实用跨语言分词所必需的。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Method: 本研究系统地调查了实体指代如何影响基于RAG的系统的文档检索和生成性能，重点在于检索相关性、上下文理解和整体响应质量。

Result: 研究发现，指代消解可以提高检索效果并改善问答（QA）性能。在检索任务中，对比不同池化策略的分析表明，应用指代消解后，平均池化表现出更优的上下文捕捉能力。在QA任务中，较小的模型从消歧过程中受益更多，这可能是因为它们处理指代模糊性的内在能力有限。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在加深对RAG中指代复杂性所带来的挑战的理解，并为改进知识密集型AI应用中的检索和生成提供指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

Method: DocCHA是一个自信感知的模块化框架，通过将诊断过程分解为三个阶段：(1) 症状获取，(2) 病史获取，(3) 因果图构建，模拟临床推理。每个模块使用可解释的置信度分数来指导自适应提问、优先考虑信息澄清和精炼薄弱的推理链接。

Result: DocCHA在两个真实的中文咨询数据集（IMCS21, DX）上评估，始终优于基于提示的LLM基线（GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3），诊断准确率提高了高达5.18%，症状回忆提高了30%以上，仅略微增加了对话轮次。

Conclusion: DocCHA在结构化、透明和高效的诊断对话中表现出色，为多语言和资源受限环境中的可信LLM驱动的临床助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

*Achuth Chandrasekhar,Amir Barati Farimani*

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种利用大型语言模型和自动化工具来简化分子动力学模拟输入文件生成的自动化流程，从而提高了效率并减少了人为错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准备高质量的MD模拟输入文件是一个耗时且容易出错的过程。

Method: 该工作引入了一个自动化流程，利用大型语言模型（LLMs），特别是Gemini 2.0 Flash，结合Python脚本和基于Selenium的网页自动化，以简化MD输入文件的生成。

Result: 该方法减少了设置时间，最小化了手动错误，并提供了处理多个蛋白质系统的可扩展解决方案。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中LLMs的广泛应用铺平了道路，提供了一个强大且可适应的平台，用于未来的模拟自动化发展。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end

multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle in industrial anomaly detection and reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and generalizing to unseen categories.

Method: We propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO).

Result: SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解决方案在个性化、抽象和可靠回忆用户特定信息方面存在局限性，因此需要一种更强大的记忆系统。

Method: MIRIX 是一个模块化、多代理记忆系统，包含六种不同的记忆类型和一个动态控制和协调更新和检索的多代理框架。

Result: 在 ScreenshotVQA 和 LOCOMO 基准测试中，MIRIX 分别实现了比 RAG 基线高 35% 的准确率和 85.4% 的最先进性能。

Conclusion: MIRIX 设置了记忆增强型 LLM 代理的新性能标准，并提供了一个包应用以让用户体验其记忆系统。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

Motivation: 本文旨在理解不同类型的奖励模型背后的隐式偏差，以解释IM-RMs在泛化性能上的不足。

Method: 本文通过理论和实验研究了隐式奖励模型（IM-RMs）和显式奖励模型（EX-RMs）之间的泛化差距，并分析了IM-RMs依赖于表面的token级线索的原因。

Result: 研究发现，IM-RMs更依赖于表面的token级线索，导致在token级分布变化和分布内情况下泛化性能较差。此外，本文反驳了关于泛化差距的其他假设。

Conclusion: 本文指出，看似微小的设计选择可以显著影响奖励模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Conclusion: PyVision展示了动态工具的潜力，使模型不仅能使用工具，还能发明工具，推动更自主的视觉推理发展。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual

Result: 攻击成功率高达70%，且攻击者预算增加有限。

Conclusion: 本文的研究表明，现有的基于微调的对抗提示注入攻击的防御方法在白盒设置中并不提供所声称的安全性。

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，从单体优化向更生物或构造性的AI开发模型转变的范式是可行的，这为资源高效的扩展、持续学习和更民主化的强大AI系统构建生态系统打开了新的途径。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，与单模型和朴素集成基线相比，MUSE在校准和预测性能方面都有所改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的无逆正则化框架，该框架基于稳定的分解，克服了之前方法的数值问题。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于BERT和聚类的方法，用于映射不同国家和公司的职业定义，并通过维度约简和轮廓方法提高了效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同公司和国家的职业定义可能有所不同，因此需要一种映射机制来扩展O*NET中的职业数据。

Method: 本文使用了多种基于BERT的技术和聚类方法，以及一种特殊的轮廓方法来改进结果。

Result: 本文通过实验验证了维度约简方法对聚类算法性能的影响，并通过特殊的轮廓方法提高了结果的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于聚类的方法，结合维度约简技术，可以自动区分职业，为想要转行的人提供新的路径。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

*Peiyan Zhang,Haibo Jin,Liying Kang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GuardVal，一种新的评估协议，用于动态生成和优化监狱突破提示，以更准确地评估LLM在处理安全关键情况时的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基准和评估方法难以充分应对这些挑战，留下了评估LLM漏洞的空白。

Method: 我们引入了GuardVal，这是一种新的评估协议，根据防御者LLM的状态动态生成和优化监狱突破提示。此外，我们提出了一种新的优化方法，以防止在提示优化过程中停滞，确保生成越来越有效的监狱突破提示，暴露防御者LLM中的更深层次弱点。

Result: 我们的研究结果揭示了不同模型之间的行为模式，提供了它们鲁棒性的全面视图。

Conclusion: 我们的评估过程加深了对LLM行为的理解，为未来的研究提供了见解，并推动了更安全模型的开发。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多级专家混合模型（MMoE），用于解决多模态实体链接中的提及歧义和动态选择模态内容问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能解决提及歧义和动态选择模态内容的问题，因此需要改进MEL方法。

Method: 提出了一种多级专家混合（MMoE）模型，包含描述感知的提及增强模块、多模态特征提取模块、层内专家混合和层间专家混合模块。

Result: 广泛实验表明MMoE在MEL任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MMoE在与最先进的方法比较中表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言任务中表现出色，但在现实场景中容易产生幻觉。本文从模态冲突的角度研究多模态大语言模型中的幻觉现象。

Method: 基于提示工程、监督微调和强化学习的三种方法被提出以减轻由模态冲突引起的幻觉。

Conclusion: 我们的工作揭示了导致幻觉的未被注意的模态冲突，并为MLLMs的鲁棒性提供了更多见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注多模态评估，但较少关注多语言能力的评估。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一个基准来评估大型多模态模型的多语言能力。

Method: 本文引入了LinguaMark基准，用于评估大型多模态模型在多语言视觉问答任务中的表现，并使用三个关键指标：偏见、答案相关性和忠实性进行评估。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）和开源模型（如Gemma3和Qwen2.5）在社会属性上表现良好，Qwen2.5在多种语言中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了LinguaMark基准，用于评估最先进的大型多模态模型在多语言视觉问答任务中的表现，并发现闭源模型和开源模型在社会属性上表现良好，Qwen2.5在多种语言中表现出色。同时，作者发布了基准和评估代码以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpatialViz-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating spatial visualization in MLLMs, revealing significant deficiencies in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of spatial visualization in MLLMs are insufficient, often embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. IQ tests or math competitions may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability.

Method: The paper introduces SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. It evaluates 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs to reveal performance variations and uncover counter-intuitive findings.

Result: The evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power. It also uncovers counter-intuitive findings such as difficulty perception misaligning with human intuition, dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and models defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone.

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs still have deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, addressing a significant lacuna in the field.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by introducing a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning.

Method: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. The framework integrates three critical components: a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason; a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP).

It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across various reasoning tasks on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales.

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities and models.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TreeBench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning, and TreeVGR, a training paradigm that improves performance on such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no benchmark to evaluate visual grounded reasoning capabilities holistically. The goal is to bridge this gap by proposing a diagnostic benchmark and a training paradigm that improves performance on such tasks.

Method: TreeBench is built on three principles: focused visual perception, traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR is a training paradigm that supervises localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning.

Result: TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, where even the most advanced models struggle. TreeVGR improves performance on several benchmarks, proving the importance of traceability.

Conclusion: TreeVGR shows that traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning, and the proposed TreeBench provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark

### [66] [A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251)
*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的电影推荐框架，该框架在多个评估指标上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐算法无法根据用户通过文本提供的个性化偏好进行推荐，而大语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理方面表现出色，因此我们提出了一种新的框架来模仿朋友根据个人口味推荐物品的方式。

Method: 我们使用SVD或SVD++算法生成初始电影推荐，并利用大语言模型（LLM）来增强传统算法的输出，同时整合基于语言的用户偏好输入。

Result: 我们的框架在所有评估指标上都明显优于传统的SVD和SVD++算法，例如累积命中率提高了约6倍，NDCG提高了约3.7倍。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在所有使用的评估指标上都显著优于SVD和SVD++，尽管计算开销略有增加。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.
