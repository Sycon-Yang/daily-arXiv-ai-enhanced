### [1] [Are you sure? Measuring models bias in content moderation through uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22699)
*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督方法，通过模型对弱势群体标注者消息分类的不确定性来评估其偏见，并发现某些预训练模型虽然对少数群体标签的预测准确率高，但置信度低，从而揭示了模型在不同群体中的代表性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动内容审核对于确保社交媒体的安全至关重要。基于语言模型的分类器被越来越多地采用，但它们会加剧种族和社会偏见。尽管已经开发了若干资源和基准语料库来应对这一问题，但衡量模型在内容审核中的公平性仍然是一个开放性问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种无监督方法，根据模型对属于弱势群体的人类标注者的消息分类的不确定性进行基准测试。我们使用不确定性（通过合规模型预测技术计算）作为分析11个模型对女性和非白人标注者的偏见的代理，并观察其与基于性能的指标（如F1分数）的差异。

Result: 结果表明，一些预训练模型可以高精度预测来自少数群体的标签，即使它们的预测置信度较低。

Conclusion: 通过测量模型的置信度，我们能够看到哪些标注者群体在预训练模型中得到更好的表示，并在模型实际使用前引导去偏过程。

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

### [2] [AccessEval: Benchmarking Disability Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22703)
*Srikant Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了AccessEval，一个评估21个闭源和开源大型语言模型在不同现实领域和残疾类型中的表现的基准测试。结果表明，针对与残疾相关的查询的回应往往更加负面，存在更多刻板印象和事实错误。这揭示了模型行为中持续存在的能力主义，并强调了在日常应用中减轻偏见的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了系统地研究各种残疾情境下这些影响，我们引入了AccessEval，这是一个基准测试，用于评估21个封闭源代码和开源LLMs在6个现实世界领域和9种残疾类型中的表现，使用成对的中性查询和残疾意识查询。

Method: 我们引入了AccessEval（可访问性评估），这是一个基准测试，用于评估21个封闭源代码和开源LLMs在6个现实世界领域和9种残疾类型中的表现，使用成对的中性查询和残疾意识查询。我们使用情感、社会认知和事实准确性指标评估模型输出。

Result: 我们的分析揭示了针对与残疾相关的查询的回应往往具有更负面的语气、更多的刻板印象和更高的事实错误，这些影响在不同的领域和残疾类型中表现出显著的差异。这些差异反映了模型行为中持续存在的能力主义。

Conclusion: 我们的分析揭示了针对与残疾相关的查询的回应往往具有更负面的语气、更多的刻板印象和更高的事实错误，这些影响在不同的领域和残疾类型中表现出显著的差异。这些差异反映了模型行为中持续存在的能力主义。通过在现实世界决策情境中检查模型性能，我们更好地阐明了这些偏见如何转化为对残疾用户的实际伤害。这种框架有助于弥合技术评估和用户影响之间的差距，强调了在日常应用中减轻偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

### [3] [RAR$^2$: Retrieval-Augmented Medical Reasoning via Thought-Driven Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22713)
*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了RAR$^2$，一种改进增强推理检索和增强推理检索的联合学习框架，通过构建思维过程来揭示隐含的知识需求，并利用它来指导检索和答案生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常专注于优化查询，而没有明确建模推理过程，限制了它们检索和整合临床相关知识的能力。

Method: 提出了一种联合学习框架RAR$^2$，以改进增强推理的检索和增强推理的检索。构建了一个混合偏好对的训练数据集，并应用直接偏好优化（DPO）来训练模型。此外，设计了两种测试时缩放策略以探索框架的边界。

Result: 实验表明，RAR$^2$在多个生物医学问答数据集上有效，优于使用或不使用微调的RAG基线。

Conclusion: RAR$^2$在多个生物医学问答数据集上表现出色，优于使用或不使用微调的RAG基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

### [4] [TRUEBench: Can LLM Response Meet Real-world Constraints as Productivity Assistant?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22715)
*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-based productivity assistants, addressing gaps in multilinguality, capturing implicit constraints, and handling complex multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating the real-world instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Current benchmarks often lack sufficient multilinguality, fail to capture implicit constraints in user requests, and overlook the complexities of multi-turn dialogue.

Method: We introduced TRUEBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity assistants. It features input prompts across 12 languages, incorporates intra-instance multilingual instructions, employs rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints, and includes complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with accumulating constraints and context switches. We also refined constraints using an LLM validator.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate.

Conclusion: TRUEBench offers a demanding and realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis with Dynamic Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22729)
*Sadia Abdulhalim,Muaz Albaghdadi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为动态注意力融合（DAF）的轻量级框架，该框架结合了预训练语言模型的冻结文本嵌入和语音编码器的声学特征，使用自适应注意力机制来加权每个模态。DAF模型在多模态基准测试中表现优于静态融合和单模态基线，提升了情感预测的准确性，并对情感计算应用有广泛影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的情感分析一直是一个单模态任务，仅依赖于文本。这种方法忽略了语音语调和韵律等非语言线索，这些线索对于捕捉真实的情感意图至关重要。

Method: 我们引入了动态注意力融合（DAF），这是一个轻量级框架，结合了预训练语言模型的冻结文本嵌入和语音编码器的声学特征，使用自适应注意力机制按每个话语加权每个模态。

Result: 我们的DAF模型在大型多模态基准测试中始终优于静态融合和单模态基线。我们报告了F1分数的显著提升和预测误差的减少，并进行了各种消融研究，支持我们的假设，即动态加权策略对于建模情感复杂的输入是至关重要的。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合语言和非语言信息，我们的方法为情感预测提供了更稳健的基础，并对情感计算应用有更广泛的影响，从情绪识别和心理健康评估到更自然的人机交互。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

### [6] [Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738)
*Parikshit Bansal,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种近似从联合分布中采样多个token的方法，通过在现有大型扩散语言模型上开发一个轻量级的单层“采样器”，从而在单次完整模型前向传递中生成多个未遮蔽的token。实验表明，该方法在预训练模型和指令调优模型上都有效，并且在语言建模、数学和编码任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自回归语言模型中，每个token是基于所有过去token进行采样的，因此整体字符串是从模型表示的正确底层联合分布中采样的。然而，遮蔽扩散语言模型通过无遮蔽token按顺序或并行生成文本，这可能导致字符串偏离真实联合分布。因此，需要一种方法来近似从联合分布中采样多个token。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的轻量级单层“采样器”，该采样器在现有大型扩散语言模型的基础上进行训练，以模仿完整模型的精确联合采样。通过在一次完整模型前向传递后多次运行该采样器层，可以生成多个未遮蔽的token。

Result: 实验结果表明，当每个完整模型去噪步骤中无遮蔽四个token时，该采样算法相对于真实联合分布的MAUVE得分为0.87（与边际基线0.31相比）。该方法在预训练模型和指令调优模型上均表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种近似从联合分布中采样多个token的方法，通过在现有大型扩散语言模型上开发一个轻量级的单层“采样器”，从而在单次完整模型前向传递中生成多个未遮蔽的token。实验表明，该方法在预训练模型和指令调优模型上都有效，并且在语言建模、数学和编码任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

### [7] [Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739)
*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Painless Activation Steering (PAS)，这是一种完全自动化的激活转向方法，可以在任何给定的带标签数据集上使用，无需提示构造、特征标记或人工干预。PAS在多个模型和任务上展示了其有效性，并在某些任务上超过了其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活转向技术需要手工制作的提示对或劳动密集型特征注释，这使得它们比即插即用的方法（如强化学习和监督微调）更不方便。

Method: 我们引入了Painless Activation Steering (PAS)，这是一种完全自动化的激活转向方法，可以在任何给定的带标签数据集上使用，无需提示构造、特征标记或人工干预。

Result: PAS在三个开放权重模型和18个任务上进行了评估，发现PAS可靠地提高了行为任务的性能，但并未提高智能导向任务的性能。iPAS在偏见、道德和对齐方面表现出最强的因果转向效果。此外，PAS在上下文学习和监督微调的基础上还带来了额外的增益。

Conclusion: 我们的结果提供了对激活转向在何处有效、何处失败以及如何将其作为实用的自动化语言模型后训练选项进行部署的描述。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

### [8] [MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22750)
*Jeonghyun Park,Ingeol Baek,Seunghyun Yoon,Haeun Jang,Aparna Garimella,Akriti Jain,Nedim Lipka,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MIRAGE基准，用于分析和评估多跳推理中的歧义问题，并提出了CLARION框架，该框架在MIRAGE上表现出色，为更适应和稳健的推理系统提供了新的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多跳问答（QA）常常涉及与推理过程本身不可分割的歧义。这种歧义带来了独特的挑战，其中从一个问题中涌现出多个推理路径，每个都需要独立解决。由于每个子问题都是模糊的，模型必须在每一步解决歧义。因此，回答一个问题需要在整个推理链中处理多层歧义。然而，当前的大规模语言模型（LLMs）在此设置中表现不佳，通常探索错误的推理路径并产生不完整的答案。

Method: 引入了一个名为MIRAGE的基准，用于分析和评估歧义解释和多跳推理的挑战性交叉点。此外，提出了一种多代理框架CLARION，以显著优于现有方法的方式解决多跳歧义问题。

Result: MIRAGE包含1,142个高质量的模糊多跳问题示例，根据句法、一般和语义歧义进行分类，并通过严格的多LLM验证流程进行筛选。实验结果表明，即使最先进的模型在MIRAGE上也表现不佳，这证实了在多步骤推理中解决歧义是一个独特且重要的挑战。CLARION在MIRAGE上显著优于现有方法，为更适应和稳健的推理系统铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 研究发现，即使最先进的模型在MIRAGE上也表现不佳，这证实了在多步骤推理中解决歧义是一个独特且重要的挑战。为了建立一个稳健的基线，我们提出了CLARION，这是一种多代理框架，在MIRAGE上显著优于现有方法，为更适应和稳健的推理系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

### [9] [ML2B: Multi-Lingual ML Benchmark For AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22768)
*Ekaterina Trofimova,Zosia Shamina,Maria Selifanova,Artem Zaitsev,Remi Savchuk,Maxim Minets,Daria Ozerova,Emil Sataev,Denis Zuenko,Andrey E. Ustyuzhanin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ML2B，第一个评估多语言ML代码生成的基准，包含30个Kaggle竞赛，翻译成13种自然语言，并提供了评估框架和结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ML代码生成基准主要局限于英语，忽视了ML研究和实践的全球性和多语言性。

Method: 我们使用AIDE，一个用于端到端评估数据科学管道的自动化框架，来评估多语言ML代码生成。

Result: 我们的结果揭示了非英语任务上的性能下降15-45%，突显了代码生成中多语言表示学习的关键挑战。

Conclusion: ML2B基准、评估框架和全面结果已通过我们的GitHub仓库提供，以促进多语言ML代码生成的未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

### [10] [ArFake: A Multi-Dialect Benchmark and Baselines for Arabic Spoof-Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22808)
*Mohamed Maged,Alhassan Ehab,Ali Mekky,Besher Hassan,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了第一个多方言阿拉伯欺骗语音数据集，并评估了不同TTS模型生成的合成语音样本的难度。结果表明，FishSpeech在阿拉伯语音克隆中表现最佳，但依赖单一TTS可能限制泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成文本到语音模型的兴起，区分真实和合成语音变得具有挑战性，特别是对于阿拉伯语，其研究关注有限。大多数欺骗检测工作集中在英语上，这为阿拉伯语及其许多方言留下了显著的空白。

Method: 我们引入了第一个多方言阿拉伯欺骗语音数据集。为了评估每个模型生成的合成音频的难度并确定哪个模型产生最具挑战性的样本，我们进行了一个评估管道，包括使用两种方法训练分类器：现代基于嵌入的方法结合分类器头部；经典机器学习算法应用于MFCC特征；以及RawNet2架构。该管道进一步包括基于人类评分的平均意见分数计算，以及将原始和合成数据集通过自动语音识别模型进行处理以测量词错误率。

Result: 我们的结果表明，FishSpeech在Casab兰卡语料库上的阿拉伯语音克隆中优于其他TTS模型，产生了更逼真和具有挑战性的合成语音样本。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，FishSpeech在Casablanca语料库上的阿拉伯语音克隆中优于其他TTS模型，产生了更逼真和具有挑战性的合成语音样本。然而，依赖单一TTS进行数据集创建可能会限制泛化能力。

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

### [12] [Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824)
*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL)的新方法，用于训练大型语言模型（LLM）。该方法通过让模型生成对给定问题和解决方案的批评，并根据生成的批评是否与真实判断一致来给予奖励。实验表明，基于CRL的模型在多个基准测试中表现优于仅使用传统强化学习（RL）的模型，显示出CRL作为RL补充的巨大潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的研究表明，明确教授LLMs如何进行批评是有益的。受这些研究的启发，我们提出了CRL，以解决传统RL在生成响应时缺乏机制来促进批评或反思的问题。

Method: 我们提出了Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL)，其中模型被任务生成给定(问题, 解决方案)对的批评。奖励仅由生成的批评的最终判断标签c是否与真实判断c*一致来决定。我们引入了	extsc{Critique-Coder}，它通过用20%的CRL数据替换标准RL数据来训练。

Result: 	extsc{Critique-Coder}在所有评估的基准测试中都优于仅使用RL的基线。特别是，	extsc{Critique-Coder-8B}在LiveCodeBench (v5)上达到了60%以上，超过了其他推理模型如DeepCoder-14B和GPT-o1。此外，	extsc{Critique-Coder}在BBEH数据集上的逻辑推理任务中表现出更好的性能，表明CRL在编码数据集上的应用增强了通用推理和批评能力。

Conclusion: 我们认为CRL是标准RL在LLM推理中的良好补充。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

### [13] [ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830)
*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了ChatInject攻击方法，展示了其在多轮对话中对LLM代理的有效性，并指出现有防御措施的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLM对结构化聊天模板的依赖性以及通过有说服力的多轮对话进行上下文操纵的潜在漏洞，因为以往的研究主要集中在纯文本注入攻击上。

Method: 研究引入了ChatInject攻击方法，通过模仿原生聊天模板来格式化恶意负载，并开发了一个基于说服的多轮变体，以在对话回合中引导代理接受和执行可疑操作。

Result: 实验结果表明，ChatInject在AgentDojo和InjecAgent上的平均攻击成功率显著提高，多轮对话在InjecAgent上的平均成功率达到52.33%。此外，基于聊天模板的负载在不同模型之间具有很强的可迁移性，即使在封闭源代码的LLM上也有效，而现有的基于提示的防御措施对这种攻击方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前代理系统中的漏洞，表明需要改进防御机制以应对ChatInject等新型攻击。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong
performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2)
chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models
and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown
template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely
ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn
variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

### [14] [Learning to Detect Relevant Contexts and Knowledge for Response Selection in Retrieval-based Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22845)
*Kai Hua,Zhiyuan Feng,Chongyang Tao,Rui Yan,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多轮响应选择模型（RSM-DCK），能够检测上下文和知识集合的相关部分，从而提高响应选择的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于检索的对话系统工作已经投入了大量努力来利用神经网络构建匹配模型，其中所有上下文和知识内容都被用来以各种表示方法匹配响应候选。但实际上，上下文和知识的不同部分对于识别适当的响应候选是不同重要的，因为许多话语由于主题转移而无用。那些过多的无用信息会影响匹配过程并导致性能下降。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为RSM-DCK的多轮响应选择模型，该模型可以检测上下文和知识集合的相关部分。首先，使用最近的上下文作为查询，在词级和话语级语义上预选相关部分。然后，响应候选与选定的上下文和知识集合分别交互。最后，利用上下文和响应候选的融合表示来更自信地后选知识集合的相关部分进行匹配。

Result: 我们在两个基准数据集上测试了所提出的模型。评估结果表明，我们的模型比现有方法表现更好，并能有效检测相关上下文和知识以进行响应选择。

Conclusion: 我们的模型在两个基准数据集上进行了测试，评估结果表明我们的模型比现有方法表现更好，并能有效检测相关上下文和知识以进行响应选择。

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

*Jiaqian Li,Yanshu Li,Ligong Han,Ruixiang Tang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的隐式ICL方法In-Context Routing (ICR)，在注意力logits层面内化可泛化的ICL模式，实现了零样本成本下的少样本性能，并在多个数据集和模型上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于注入偏移向量到残差流中，这些通常从标记的示例或任务特定对齐中构建，无法充分利用ICL的结构机制，泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出了一种新的隐式ICL方法In-Context Routing (ICR)，在注意力logits层面内化可泛化的ICL模式，并利用可学习的输入条件路由器来调节注意力logits。

Result: 在12个跨不同领域的现实数据集和多个LLM上评估了ICR，结果表明ICR始终优于需要任务特定检索或训练的先前隐式ICL方法，并且在现有方法难以处理的域外任务中表现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ICR能够推动ICL的实际价值边界，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

*R. Alexander Knipper,Charles S. Knipper,Kaiqi Zhang,Valerie Sims,Clint Bowers,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates cognitive biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) and finds that they exhibit bias-consistent behavior in a significant percentage of instances. The study shows that both model size and prompt specificity affect bias susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which they exhibit cognitive biases.

Method: The paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. It introduces a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks, hand-curates a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive biases in collaboration with psychologists, and proposes a scalable approach for generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates.

Result: LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring, availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect theory, and representativeness biases. Larger size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case (Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in a significant percentage of instances, and both model size and prompt specificity play a significant role in bias susceptibility.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图的方法，结合词典和深度学习技术，用于预测阿拉伯语文档级可读性。实验结果表明，该方法在多个可读性指标上优于独立的GNN或transformer分支。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高阿拉伯语文档级可读性的预测效果，本文提出了一种基于图的方法，结合词典和深度学习技术。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于图的方法，结合词典来预测阿拉伯语的文档级可读性，这是BAREC共享任务2025年约束赛道的一部分。我们的系统将每个文档建模为句子级图，其中节点代表句子和词干，边捕捉语言关系，如词汇共现和类别成员关系。句子节点通过SAMER词典以及阿拉伯变压器模型的上下文嵌入进行增强。图神经网络（GNN）和变压器句子编码器作为两个独立的分支进行训练，并在推理时通过后期融合结合其预测。对于文档级预测，使用最大池化聚合句子级输出以反映最困难的句子。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种混合方法在多个可读性指标上优于独立的GNN或transformer分支。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，这种混合方法在多个可读性指标上优于独立的GNN或transformer分支。总体而言，研究结果表明融合在文档层面具有优势，但GNN-only方法在精确预测句子层面的可读性方面仍然更强大。

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

Motivation: 理论心智（ToM）是人类社会智能的关键方面，但聊天机器人和基于LLM的社会代理通常不整合它。我们希望展示明确使用ToM的LLM在对话中表现更好，更有效地实现目标。

Method: 我们引入了ToMAgent（ToMA），一个专注于ToM的对话代理。ToMA通过将ToM与对话前瞻相结合，生成对实现对话目标最有用的心理状态。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在Sotopia交互式社会评估基准上优于各种基线。全面分析显示，ToMA表现出更具战略性和目标导向的推理行为，这使得其能够进行长期适应，同时保持与合作伙伴的良好关系。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，将ToM集成到LLM代理中是构建社会智能代理的一个重要进展。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了任务特定优化可以产生超越通用系统的模型，同时需要的计算资源显著减少。

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while
requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o在药物配方匹配、药物-药物相互作用识别和准备药物订单句子方面的表现，发现其整体表现较差，需要领域特定训练和全面评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在推荐适当药物方案方面的一致性，特别是在药物配方匹配、药物-药物相互作用识别和准备药物订单句子方面的表现。

Method: 使用GTP-4o完成了三个实验，通过计算余弦相似度、归一化Levenshtein相似度和ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1来量化准确性，或者通过临床医生的手动评估。

Result: GPT-4o在药物配方匹配方面表现不佳，经常遗漏可用的药物配方（每种药物平均1.23个）并出现不存在的配方（每种药物平均1.14个）。只有49%的测试药物与所有可用配方正确匹配。药物配方越多，准确性越低。GPT-4o在识别药物-药物相互作用方面也不一致，尽管在搜索增强评估中表现优于其内部知识（54.7% vs. 69.2%）。然而，允许网络搜索在没有药物-药物相互作用的情况下会降低性能（中位数正确率100% vs. 40%）。最后，GPT-4o在准备药物订单句子方面表现中等，只有65.8%的药物订单句子没有药物或缩写错误。

Conclusion: 模型在所有测试中的表现总体较差，这突显了通过临床医生标注的数据集进行领域特定训练和全面评估框架的必要性。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

Method: 本文采用了一种管道，利用大语言模型（LLMs）作为接口，通过提示文本到图像模型来生成故事情节的插图。

Result: 本文通过人类注释任务获得了这些插图的成对质量判断，并发布了SceneIllustrations数据集。

Conclusion: 本文展示了LLMs能够有效地将故事文本中隐含的场景知识进行口头表达，并且这种能力在生成和评估插图方面具有影响力。此外，本文还发布了SceneIllustrations数据集，作为未来跨模态叙事转换研究的新资源。

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

TL;DR: 研究发现，显式诱导电路并不能保证提升ICL性能，自然文本在计算恒定时可能更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是测试显式诱导电路是否在预训练期间有助于改进ICL，或者自然文本是否在计算保持恒定的情况下足够。

Method: 引入Bi-Induct，一种轻量级课程，将前向复制（Induction）、后向复制（Anti）或平衡混合注入预训练流中，以测试目标合成数据是否能加速诱导头的出现并增强ICL。

Result: Bi-Induct加速了小规模下的诱导头出现，但并未一致地产生更强的泛化能力。在标准LM基准测试中，Bi-Induct与自然仅训练相当；在函数风格的ICL探测中，1B自然仅模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，显式诱导电路并不足以提高上下文学习（ICL）性能；ICL的提升依赖于这些电路变得功能必要。

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

Conclusion: 这些发现指出了可能支持人类口语词识别的表征策略，挑战了语音和形态学需要独立语言表征的假设。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受控研究，通过保持内容不变而改变结构来分析表格表示对表格问答性能的影响，并引入了一个诊断基准以支持详细分析。实验结果表明，不同方法在不同条件下表现各异，强调了表示在塑造表格问答性能中的核心作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试与固定的格式相关，并未系统地研究表示本身如何影响模型性能。在现实世界的设置中，表格问答必须在结构化数据库和包含文本字段的半结构化表格上运行。

Method: 我们提出了一个受控研究，通过保持内容不变而改变结构来隔离表格表示的作用。使用一个语义化管道，我们生成成对的结构化和半结构化表格，从而可以在不同的建模范式之间进行直接比较。

Result: 实验结果揭示了持续的权衡：基于SQL的方法在结构化输入上具有高准确性，但在半结构化数据上退化；大型语言模型表现出灵活性但精度降低；混合方法在噪声模式下表现良好。这些效应随着更大的表格和更复杂的查询而加剧。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了表格表示对表格问答性能的中心作用，并为模型选择和设计提供了可行的见解，为更稳健的混合方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

TL;DR: ADAM is a framework for evaluating and improving multimodal large language models in biographical reasoning, including a multilingual dataset, cognitive evaluations, and a retrieval-augmented generation system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate and improve multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical reasoning, as this is a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge.

Method: ADAM includes AdamDB, a multilingual and multimodal dataset, and AdamBench, which provides cognitively structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy. Additionally, AdamRAG is proposed to address hallucinations in biographical contexts.

Result: Experiments show that AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval.

Conclusion: ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally
grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual,
accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are
under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ReMemR1的记忆增强代理，以及一种多级奖励强化学习方法（RLMLR），以解决大型语言模型在长上下文问答中的挑战。实验结果表明，该方法在长文档问答任务中表现出色。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在长上下文问答中面临挑战，其中查询的关键证据可能分散在数百万个标记中。现有的方法通过在单次文档扫描过程中动态更新记忆语料库来增强大型语言模型，但这种方法存在不可逆的单向处理、信息丢失和稀疏强化学习信号的问题。

Method: 我们提出了ReMemR1，这是一种带有回调增强记忆的记忆增强代理，允许从整个记忆历史中选择性检索，并允许非线性推理和重新访问早期证据。此外，我们还提出了多级奖励强化学习（RLMLR），结合最终答案奖励与密集的步骤级信号，以指导有效的记忆使用。

Result: 实验表明，ReMemR1在长文档问答任务中相比现有的基于记忆的方法有显著提升，验证了ReMemR1作为长上下文推理代理的有效解决方案。

Conclusion: 实验表明，ReMemR1在长文档问答任务中相比现有的基于记忆的方法有显著提升，验证了ReMemR1作为长上下文推理代理的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多智能体辩论系统中LLMs的sycophancy问题，并提出了一种框架来评估和应对这种现象。研究发现sycophancy会加剧分歧崩溃并降低准确性，从而提出了设计原则以在智能体交互中平衡分歧与合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的sycophancy行为可能导致辩论陷入过早共识，从而削弱多智能体辩论的优势。尽管先前的研究关注用户-LLM的sycophancy，但辩论中代理间sycophancy的影响仍不清楚。因此，我们需要一个框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 我们引入了一个操作框架，该框架(1)提出了适用于MADS设置的sycophancy的正式定义，(2)开发了新的指标来评估代理sycophancy水平及其对信息交换的影响，并(3)系统地研究了不同水平的sycophancy在代理角色（辩论者和法官）上如何影响去中心化和集中式辩论框架的结果。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，sycophancy是多智能体辩论中的核心故障模式，它在达到正确结论之前加剧了分歧崩溃，并且其准确性低于单智能体基线。此外，sycophancy源于不同的辩论者驱动和法官驱动的故障模式。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了sycophancy是多智能体辩论中的核心故障模式，它在达到正确结论之前加剧了分歧崩溃，并且其准确性低于单智能体基线。基于这些发现，我们提出了可操作的设计原则，以在智能体交互中有效平衡有益的分歧与合作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的无需自我评估的方法，用于不可验证的任务，旨在实现轻量级且有效的自我改进。实验表明，该方法在计算效率和整体性能方面都优于传统的自我评估方法。

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions.

Method: EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning.

Result: An 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.

Conclusion: EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型中的不确定性仍然是一个基本挑战，特别是在存在多个有效输出的创造性任务中。

Method: 我们使用credal集（概率分布的凸包）提出了一种几何框架，以量化和分解神经文本生成中的不确定性，并与人类创意变化进行校准。

Result: 我们的credal集分析揭示了模型在捕捉人类创意变化方面的显著差距，最佳模型-人类校准仅达到0.434（Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7）。

Conclusion: 我们的几何框架为改进人机创意对齐的生成系统提供了可行的见解。我们发布了完整的实验框架。

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为d$^2$Cache的无需训练的近似KV缓存框架，用于加速基于扩散的大语言模型（dLLMs）的推理。该方法通过两阶段细粒度选择策略，自适应地更新部分令牌的KV状态，并缓存其他令牌的KV状态以供重用。实验结果表明，d$^2$Cache在提升推理速度的同时，也改善了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs)在推理效率方面存在不足，因为它们依赖于双向注意力，无法直接从标准的键值（KV）缓存中受益，而自回归模型（ARMs）可以。

Method: 引入了	extit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache)，这是一种无需训练的近似KV缓存框架，用于加速dLLM推理。d$^2$Cache采用两阶段细粒度选择策略，以识别令牌并在每个解码步骤中自适应更新其KV状态，同时缓存剩余令牌的KV状态以供重用。

Result: 在两个代表性的dLLMs（如LLaDA和Dream）上的广泛实验结果表明，d$^2$Cache不仅实现了显著的推理加速，还提高了生成质量。

Conclusion: d$^2$Cache不仅实现了显著的推理加速，还在生成质量上取得了稳定的提升。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at

Motivation: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling the design of novel compounds with specific properties. However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings.

Method: SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the invalid SMILES.

Result: Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing performance on other metrics.

Conclusion: SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models.

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

Method: 我们引入了TagPR，这是一种新颖的训练框架，通过标记思想的方法显著增强了大型语言模型的个性化推理内在能力。我们的方法首先开发了一个数据驱动的管道来自动生成和语义标记推理链，创建一个促进可解释推理的结构化数据集。然后，我们提出了一种协同训练策略，首先在这些标记数据上进行监督微调以建立基础推理模式，接着进行多阶段强化学习（RL）过程。这个RL阶段由一个独特的复合奖励信号指导，该信号整合了基于标签的约束和一个带有用户嵌入的新个性化奖励模型（PRMU），以实现与用户特定逻辑的精细对齐。

Result: 在公共LaMP基准和自构建数据集上的广泛实验表明，我们的方法实现了最先进的结果，在所有任务中平均比基础模型提高了32.65%。

LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

### [37] [Tree Reward-Aligned Search for TReASURe in Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23146)
*Zichao Yu,Ming Li,Wenyi Zhang,Weiguo Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TReASURe is a tree-search test-time alignment method that addresses the challenges of parallel unmasking and high-variance reward estimation in Masked Diffusion Language Models. It introduces UnmaskBranch and ResubstituteScore to improve exploration and pruning stability, achieving state-of-the-art results in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges: (i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration, and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance estimates, making pruning unstable.

Method: TReASURe introduces UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per parent node, and ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy completions.

Result: Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs (number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

Conclusion: TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

### [38] [Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Enhanced Multi-Turn Interactions with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23166)
*Chenxing Wei,Hong Wang,Ying He,Fei Yu,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROSA is a lightweight algorithm that improves the performance of LLMs in multi-turn interactions by adapting to user feedback efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs performance often degrades in extended interactions because they are trained on static, single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user feedback.

Method: ROSA is a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM, guiding the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a single, efficient update step.

Result: ROSA achieves significant improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: ROSA achieves significant improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的预训练方法，通过在预训练阶段引入额外的计算步骤，使得模型在相同推理成本下表现优于更大的模型，并且增加潜在思维数量可以进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以在预训练阶段利用类似Chain-of-Thought（CoT）的计算步骤扩展来提高每个单独标记的生成效果。

Method: 提出了一种新的预训练方法：使用潜在思维预训练语言模型。该方法让语言模型首先生成一个中间潜在思维（当前位置的最后一个隐藏状态），然后将其作为输入来预测实际的后续标记。

Result: 实验表明，在相同的推理成本下，每token生成一个额外潜在思维的模型优于参数量是其两倍的标准模型。例如，1.4B参数的模型在Pile数据集上预训练后，显著优于在相同数据上训练的2.8B参数的Pythia模型。此外，增加每个实际标记生成的潜在思维数量可以持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过在预训练阶段引入额外的计算步骤，模型可以在相同的推理成本下超越参数量更大的标准模型，并且增加生成的潜在思维数量可以持续提升模型性能。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完整的三阶段框架，用于提高大型语言模型驱动的多智能体系统的指令层次结构合规性，通过诊断、定位和对齐三个步骤实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的多智能体系统（MAS）在复杂任务中迅速推进了协作推理、工具使用和角色专业化协调。然而，可靠性关键的部署仍受到一种系统性故障模式的阻碍：在指令冲突（系统-用户、同行之间）下，代理在存在竞争需求时会错误地优先考虑系统级规则。此外，广泛使用的宏观层面指标（如pass@k）掩盖了这些微观层面的违规行为，并未提供有效的补救措施

Method: 我们提出了一个完整的三阶段框架：(1) 诊断 - 基于上下文的角色遵循评分（CRAS），一个查询级、上下文感知的评分指标，将角色遵循分解为四个可衡量的维度；(2) 定位 - 注意力漂移分析，揭示了指令冲突主要由集中在中间层的注意力头解决；(3) 对齐 - 指令层的手术对齐（SAIL），仅在定位的焦点层上安装LoRA，并优化了一个基于令牌加权DPO风格的偏好目标，根据其焦点注意力贡献来授予令牌

Result: 在标准基准和MAS框架上，我们的手术方法提高了指令层次结构的合规性（例如，在MedQA上使用AutoGen提高了5.60%）

Conclusion: 我们的手术方法在不进行全模型微调的情况下提高了指令层次结构的合规性（例如，在MedQA上使用AutoGen提高了5.60%）

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用EEG和眼动追踪数据，揭示了句法结构构建可能在类别检测之前发生，并主导词汇影响，支持预测性的'树形脚手架'理解理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理语言学中的一个核心问题是句法在句子处理中的时间。现有的证据来自违反范式，这混淆了两个可分离的过程——句法类别检测和短语结构构建，并隐含地假设短语结构跟随类别检测。

Method: 使用ZuCo语料库的共注册EEG和眼动追踪数据来区分这些过程，并在自然阅读条件下测试它们的时间顺序。分析了注视转换，使用贝叶斯网络建模，并研究了固定相关电位。

Result: 读者优先在句法头之间移动，表明短语结构而不是串行单词顺序组织扫描路径。结构深度是偏离线性阅读的主要驱动因素，超过了词汇熟悉度和意外度。句法意外度在词开始前和早期整合期间影响神经活动。

Conclusion: 这些发现通过表明短语结构构建可以在类别检测之前发生并主导词汇影响，扩展了当前的句法时间模型，支持了预测性的'树形脚手架'理解理论。

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

TL;DR: 本文研究了推理大语言模型在少样本思维链中表现不佳的问题，提出了 I2S 方法，通过将示例转化为显式见解并生成目标特定的推理轨迹，有效提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于验证器的强化学习训练的推理大语言模型（RLMs）在少样本思维链（CoT）中的表现不如直接回答。本文旨在解决这一悖论，并探索如何有效利用上下文示例。

Method: 本文通过分析 DeepSeek-R1 的高质量推理轨迹，发现增加示例会降低准确性。随后提出了 I2S 方法，该方法通过将示例转化为显式见解并生成目标特定的推理轨迹来解决这一问题。

Result: I2S 和 I2S+ 在多个基准测试中表现出色，甚至对 GPT 模型也有显著提升。例如，在 AIME'25 上，GPT-4.1 提升了 +14.0%，o1-mini 在 AIME 和 GPQA 上分别提升了 +2.7% 和 +1.7%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Insight-to-Solve (I2S) 的序列测试时过程，能够将示例转化为显式的、可重用的见解，并推导出目标特定的推理轨迹。实验结果表明，I2S 和 I2S+ 在多个基准测试中表现优于直接回答和测试时扩展基线，甚至对 GPT 模型也有帮助。

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

Motivation: 研究K-pop歌曲中使用的语言策略，特别是代码切换和英语歌词的使用，以了解其在全球排行榜上的成功。

Method: 本文分析了K-pop歌曲中英语和韩语歌词的比例、代码切换的频率和其他风格特征，并进行了分类任务以从歌词中预测表演者性别。

Result: 英语在在全球排行榜上的K-pop歌曲中占主导地位，男性和女性表演者都表现出高度的代码切换和英语使用。女性独唱艺术家更倾向于一致地使用英语。分类任务取得了高达0.76的宏观F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究发现，K-pop歌词中的语言选择受到全球市场压力的影响，并揭示了反映表演者身份和排行榜背景的风格模式。

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言模型在生成介词短语时如何决定其补足语是作为工具性状语还是属性修饰语，有助于改进模型对语法结构的掌握。

Method: 研究通过构建包含带有头部介词短语的提示集，分析了Gemma-2在不同上下文中生成介词补足语的能力，并利用激活投影和值向量调整来识别和控制特定注意力头的行为。

Result: 研究发现Gemma-2在给定相同上下文的情况下更倾向于生成工具性修饰语，比例为3:4。通过调整单个注意力头的值向量，可以改变这一分布，使工具性修饰语的比例降至33%，而属性修饰语的比例升至36%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Gemma-2在生成介词短语时对工具性修饰和属性修饰的偏好，并通过调整注意力头的值向量实现了对这种偏好的控制。

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

Motivation: 现有的方法要么将多轮训练简化为孤立的单轮样本，忽略了任务级规划，要么采用端到端强化学习（RL），但存在冗余且缺乏显式的进度意识整合。

Method: PARL-MT框架结合了进度意识生成（PAG）管道和进度意识引导的强化学习（PAG-RL）算法。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中，PARL-MT的表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PARL-MT显著优于现有方法，证明了进度意识在实现稳健和高效的多轮函数调用中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

Motivation: 确保维基百科的准确性至关重要，因为它是训练大型语言模型（LLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）系统的关键资源。然而，如何准确地评估和改进维基百科仍然存在挑战。

Method: 我们介绍了CLAIRE，一个结合LLM推理和检索的代理系统，以揭示潜在的不一致声明以及用于人类审查的上下文证据。此外，我们贡献了WIKICOLLIDE，第一个真实的维基百科不一致性的基准。

Result: 在用户研究中，87.5%的参与者报告说使用CLAIRE后更有信心，参与者在同一时间内识别出64.7%更多的不一致性。结合CLAIRE与人工标注，我们发现至少3.3%的英文维基百科事实与其他事实矛盾，矛盾传播到7.3%的FEVEROUS和4.0%的AmbigQA示例中。最佳全自动系统仅达到75.1%的AUROC。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，矛盾是维基百科的一个可衡量的组成部分，并且基于LLM的系统如CLAIRE可以提供一种实用的工具，帮助编辑者在大规模上提高知识的一致性。

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Motivation: 金融对话转录文本在句子级信息提取方面面临独特的挑战，因为它们的非正式结构、领域特定的词汇和可变意图密度。需要一种有效的框架来提取用户意图相关的句子。

Method: Fin-ExBERT 是一个基于领域适应的 BERT 骨干网络，并增强了 LoRA（低秩适应）适配器，以实现使用有限标记数据的高效微调。采用两阶段训练策略，包括逐步解冻和差异学习率。此外，还采用了基于概率曲率的动态阈值策略，避免固定截止启发式方法。

Conclusion: Fin-ExBERT 提供了一个可部署的解决方案，用于金融对话挖掘，具有批量评估、可视化和校准导出功能。

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a

### [49] [A2D: Any-Order, Any-Step Safety Alignment for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23286)
*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Yoonjun Cho,Dongjae Jeon,Sangwoo Shin,Hyesoo Hong,Albert No*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A2D is a token-level defense method for diffusion large language models that effectively prevents harmful outputs and enables real-time monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of harmful spans appearing at arbitrary positions in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) and to defend against template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA.

Method: A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises.

Result: A2D slashes DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B) and allows early rejection with up to 19.3x faster safe termination.

Conclusion: A2D consistently prevents the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero and enabling real-time monitoring.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

### [50] [Scaling Policy Compliance Assessment in Language Models with Policy Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23291)
*Joseph Marvin Imperial,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) to improve LLMs' policy compliance assessment capabilities, demonstrating significant performance improvements in both inference-time and training-time scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of evaluating whether an input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, known as policies, by introducing PRTs to improve LLMs' capabilities in this area.

Method: The paper introduces Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment capabilities.

Result: The empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies.

Conclusion: PRTs can enhance the performance of LLMs in policy compliance assessment and improve their ability to accurately cite policy clauses.

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SIE框架，通过自动构建结构化推理环境，实现了可扩展、可泛化和可验证的推理能力，并在实验中展示了其在不同任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学和编码环境难以扩展，而基于游戏的环境中的技能过于专门化，无法泛化。因此需要一个具有可扩展性、可泛化推理和可验证性的理想推理环境。

Method: 引入了SIE框架，通过从大规模结构化数据自动构建推理环境，利用丰富的组合模式支持可泛化的推理，并通过显式的模式和推理链提供基于规则的可验证性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SIE框架在领域内的结构化推理中取得了显著提升，并且能够将学到的组合推理技能有效推广到领域外的数学和逻辑推理任务中。此外，LLMs在信息有限的部分SIE中也能通过探索环境推断缺失信息，从而提高推理性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SIE框架不仅在领域内的结构化推理中取得了显著提升，还使学习到的组合推理技能能够有效地推广到领域外的数学和逻辑推理任务。此外，LLMs可以通过探索环境推断缺失信息，从而提高推理的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

*Tiancheng Li,Yuhang Wang,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Guo-jun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C-Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm that aggregates multiple prompts to improve AI system performance through consensus, achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether aggregating results from multiple prompts can further advance AI system capabilities, as few works have investigated this aspect.

Method: C-Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal performance. It uses an island-based evolutionary algorithm to maintain population diversity and evaluates each prompt's contribution within groups using a voting score as the fitness score.

Result: C-Evolve achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-ended and closed-ended tasks. On Qwen3-8B, it achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are higher than GEPA. For GPT-4.1-mini, it reaches 47.96% on IFBench and 95.33% on MATH.

Conclusion: C-Evolve's results demonstrate its competitive performance across various tasks, showing significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

*Han Yan,Zheyuan Liu,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM is a unified framework that improves the robustness and balance of unlearning metrics by enforcing dual-space smoothness in representation and parameter spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness, utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks.

Method: PRISM is a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance unlearning metrics. It consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter space to mitigate relearning attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE, across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better balance among key metrics.

Conclusion: PRISM outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better balance among key metrics.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter

*Xinchun Su,Chunxu Luo,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的两阶段框架MedCritical，通过使用由大教师模型微调的小语言模型进行自我对抗，以提高其推理能力，并在医学领域取得了显著的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学领域，复杂的推理任务如临床诊断、治疗计划和医学知识整合存在挑战，小语言模型的表现不如GPT-4和Deepseek等大型语言模型。最近的知识蒸馏方法试图通过教师引导的错误纠正来解决这些问题，但这种LLM作为裁判的方法在成本、时间和效率方面仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段框架MedCritical，使用由大教师模型微调的小语言模型进行自我对抗。第一阶段提取教师模型的高层次和详细长链思维模板来指导学生模型生成更复杂的推理思维。第二阶段通过模型自迭代协作引入直接偏好优化（DPO）来增强学生模型的推理能力。

Result: MedCritical模型在较低成本下实现了与传统知识蒸馏方法相当的结果。MedCritical 7B模型在CMExam基准测试中分别优于Taiyi和Huatuo-o1-7B模型3.04%和10.12%。

Conclusion: MedCritical 7B模型在CMExam基准测试中表现优于Taiyi和Huatuo-o1-7B模型，达到了7B类小模型的新SOTA性能。

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

TL;DR: MetaAPO is a novel framework for preference optimization that dynamically couples data generation with model training, using a lightweight meta-learner to guide online generation and reduce annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the evolving model policy, as existing methods fail to adapt to the model's dynamic learning state.

Method: Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), which dynamically couples data generation with model training using a lightweight meta-learner as an 'alignment gap estimator' to guide targeted online generation and assign sample-wise meta-weights.

Result: Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference optimization approaches while reducing 42% in online annotation costs.

Conclusion: MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference optimization approaches across various settings while reducing online annotation costs.

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为临床对比编码（CCD）的训练和检索无关的推理框架，以提高多模态大语言模型在放射学中的临床准确性，减少医学幻觉。实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集和模型上均能有效提升放射学报告生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在放射学中取得了显著进展，但它们经常生成临床上不支持的描述，即医学幻觉，这在需要准确性和图像引导输出的医疗应用中带来了严重风险。通过实证分析，我们发现提示引起的幻觉在放射学MLLMs中仍然普遍存在，主要是由于对临床部分的过度敏感。

Method: 我们引入了临床对比编码（CCD），这是一种无需训练和检索的推理框架，通过整合任务特定的放射学专家模型的结构化临床信号来提高临床准确性。CCD引入了双阶段对比机制，在生成过程中细化token级别的logits，从而提高临床真实性而不修改基础MLLM。

Result: 实验在三个数据集和多个模型上进行，结果表明CCD在放射学报告生成（RRG）的整体性能上始终有所提升。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上，当应用于最先进的RRG模型时，它在RadGraph-F1上实现了高达17%的提升。

Conclusion: 我们的方法提供了一种轻量级且可推广的解决方案，有效弥合了专家模型和MLLMs在放射学中的差距。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Guard Vector，这是一种通过计算守卫模型和预训练语言模型之间的参数差异得到的安全任务向量。通过将此向量与目标语言模型组合，可以得到Target Guard Model (TGM)。TGM在分类质量、语言扩展、模型可移植性和流式处理方面表现出色，同时提高了吞吐量并减少了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的守卫模型在分类质量和语言扩展方面存在局限，且需要额外的训练和目标语言标签。此外，模型的可移植性和流式处理能力也有待提高。

Method: Guard Vector是通过计算一个守卫模型（Guard Model）和一个相同架构的预训练语言模型之间的参数差异得到的。将这个向量与目标语言模型组合起来，得到Target Guard Model (TGM)。然后，使用一种结合基于前缀的训练和评估以及产生单个标记输出的分类器的方法来适应TGM。

Result: TGM在标准安全套件上提高了分类质量，并实现了对中文、日文和韩文的语言扩展，无需额外训练或目标语言标签。它还展示了在两个广泛使用的公共守卫骨干模型Llama和Gemma之间的模型可移植性。通过前缀SFT，TGM在流式处理中保持了分类质量，并且单个标记输出设计提高了吞吐量并减少了延迟。

Conclusion: TGM通过组合安全任务向量和目标语言模型，提高了分类质量，并实现了对中文、日文和韩文的语言扩展，同时保持了模型的可移植性。此外，TGM在流式处理中保持了分类质量，并提高了吞吐量和降低了延迟，从而有助于构建更负责任的人工智能生态系统。

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

Motivation: 由于预训练的计算成本很高，因此需要一种更有效的方法来研究大型语言模型的学习、推理和记忆能力。

Method: 我们提出在一次训练运行中同时进行多个预训练实验，以克服预训练的计算成本限制。

Result: 我们成功地在一个1.5B参数模型上进行了10个实验，并且能够复制之前多个工作的结果。此外，我们还进行了关于知识获取、数学推理和水印的新研究。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，在单次训练运行中进行多个预训练实验可以实现严格的科学实验，从而在计算预算内研究大型模型。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

TL;DR: GRACE is a framework that improves prompt optimization by integrating Gated Refinement and Adaptive Compression, achieving significant performance gains with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for prompt optimization often struggle to generate stable and effective prompts, leading to low efficiency and getting trapped in local optima.

Method: GRACE integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and Adaptive Compression, which refine update signals and distill the prompt's core concepts to restructure the optimization trace.

Result: In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three practical domains, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements of 4.7%, 4.4%, and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. It also uses only 25% of the prompt generation budget required by prior methods.

Conclusion: GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods and shows high optimization efficiency with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

Method: 我们形式化了Genette（1987）的副文本理论，构建了一个包含560个专家对齐副文本的数据集，并评估了具有和不具有推理痕迹的大型语言模型在显性化选择和内容上的表现。

Result: 实验表明，即使大型语言模型生成的副文本提高了受众的理解，但仍远不如翻译者创作的副文本有效。此外，统计分析显示，即使是专业翻译者在使用副文本方面也存在很大差异。

Conclusion: 我们的研究展示了在机器翻译中使用副文本显性化以超越语言等价的潜力，并提出了在单语解释和个性化适应方面的前景。

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

Conclusion: 本研究的发现有助于提高对人类评分和基于LLM的自动化评分背后推理的理解。

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

TL;DR: 研究发现，标准解码方法低估了语言模型的知识，而通过RCD策略可以有效提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多被判断为错误的答案实际上是正确的，但由于评估过于严格而被忽略，导致对模型参数知识的低估。

Method: 提出了一种名为Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD)的解码策略，该策略限制模型输出到唯一的表面形式。此外，还引入了一个名为YAGO-QA的数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用RCD策略可以显著提高模型在YAGO-QA数据集上的表现，例如Llama-3.1-70B在RCD下的F1分数为46.0%，而使用默认解码方式仅为32.3%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，标准解码方法低估了语言模型的参数知识，而RCD策略能够有效提升模型的表现。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

*Xuanming Zhang,Yuxuan Chen,Min-Hsuan Yeh,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CooT is a framework that introduces explicit cognitive self-monitoring to LLMs, improving safety and social reasoning during inference without retraining the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify. The paper aims to introduce a framework that allows for explicit, dynamic, and auditable alignment during inference.

Method: CooT is a novel decoding-time framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop. It couples a standard text generator with a cognitive perceiver that continuously monitors the unfolding sequence and uses a structured, precedence-based hierarchy of principles to detect potential misalignments.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Conclusion: CooT transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference, allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了37篇关于大规模评估中自动项目难度预测的研究，讨论了基于文本的方法的潜力，并展示了其在预测项目难度方面的高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 项目难度在考试表现、分数可解释性和所有考生的公平性中起着关键作用，特别是在大规模评估中。传统的方法需要现场测试和经典测试理论或项目反应理论校准，这可能耗时且昂贵。为了克服这些挑战，基于文本的方法利用机器学习和语言模型作为有前途的替代方案。

Method: 本文综述和综合了37篇关于大规模评估环境中自动项目难度预测的文章，涵盖了数据集、难度参数、学科领域、题目类型、项目数量、训练和测试数据分割、输入、特征、模型、评估标准和模型性能结果。

Result: 结果表明，尽管经典机器学习模型由于其可解释性仍然相关，但最先进的语言模型使用小型和大型基于变压器的架构可以捕捉语法和语义模式，而无需手动特征工程。模型性能结果被总结为未来研究的基准，总体而言，基于文本的方法有望以低至0.165的均方根误差、高达0.87的皮尔逊相关性和高达0.806的准确率预测项目难度。

Conclusion: 该综述讨论了实践意义并概述了自动化项目难度建模的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o from
OpenAI and Llama2-7b and Llama2-13b from Meta. We evaluate the models'
performance across datasets, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, text

*Dania Refai,Alaa Dalaq,Doaa Dalaq,Irfan Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis that uses LLMs to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large, high-quality labeled datasets limits progress in Arabic sentiment analysis. Active learning and LLMs have shown promise in other languages but are underexplored in Arabic.

Method: We propose an active learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis and evaluate multiple deep learning architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) across three benchmark datasets. We also compare two annotation strategies: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling.

Result: LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained through human labeling.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior performance compared to human labeling in Arabic sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估忽略了微调裁判在现实世界部署中的实际问题，因此需要研究未来证明和向后兼容性以及问题泛化性。

Method: 本文在数学领域下研究了三个方面，使用统一框架和不同的训练和测试分布、三种SFT和DPO微调算法以及三种不同的基础模型进行分析。

Result: 大多数模型在未来的证明上面临挑战，而向后兼容性相对容易，DPO训练的模型表现持续提升。持续学习在适应旧和新响应分布之间的变化时提供了更平衡的适应性。所有模型在从训练中看到的问题转移到未见过的问题时都观察到一定程度的性能下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在不断变化的生成器环境下开发和部署裁判模型提供了实际考虑因素。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

Motivation: 现有工作低估了推理质量，主要关注数据数量，这可能会将噪声或错误信息传递给学生模型。

Method: 我们提出了模型导向的推理选择蒸馏（MoRSD），并提出了一种推理难度（RD）度量来评估学生模型在给定推理下生成正确答案的能力。

Result: 与基线相比，我们在三个任务的七个数据集上平均提高了4.6%，并且通过控制推理的准确性、多样性和难度来使用更少的推理。

Conclusion: 我们的方法有望成为高效链式思维蒸馏的一种可能解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Method: 引入Jackal，一个包含100,000个自然语言请求和验证的JQL查询以及在实时Jira实例上的执行结果的大型文本到JQL基准。

Result: 在Jackal-5K上，最佳模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro）的执行准确率为60.3%。不同用户请求类型的性能差异显著：长自然语言（86.0%）、短自然语言（35.7%）、语义相似（22.7%）和语义精确（99.3%）。

Conclusion: Jackal暴露了当前最先进的LLMs的局限性，并为Jira企业数据的未来研究设定了新的基于执行的挑战。

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

Motivation: 当前主流的幻觉检测方法依赖于事实一致性验证或静态隐藏层特征，前者受限于知识覆盖范围，后者难以捕捉推理过程中的推理偏差。因此，需要一种更有效的幻觉检测方法。

Conclusion: HSAD方法通过有效结合推理过程建模与频域特征提取，克服了现有方法在知识覆盖范围和推理偏差检测方面的局限性，展示了更高的检测准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练被认为是一种表面的过程，但这种表面性也存在一个关键的权衡：提高利用能力的同时限制了探索能力。因此，我们需要一种方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为Timber的方法，通过部分将指令模型恢复到对应的基模型，以增强其探索能力，同时保持其利用能力。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen系列上的广泛实验表明，Timber可以持续改进普通的指令模型，特别是在Pass@k性能上。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了关于后训练阶段的新见解，并提出了无需训练的实用策略来优化指令模型。

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于推理的大型语言模型通常依赖于逐步生成显式标记，并且其效果通常取决于大规模监督微调或强化学习。虽然Chain-of-Thought（CoT）技术在复杂推理任务上显著提升了性能，但它们仍然效率低下，需要长的推理轨迹，增加了延迟和标记使用量。

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RemeDi的基于掩码的扩散语言模型，引入了remasking机制，以实现更灵活的文本优化。通过联合预测标记分布和每个标记的置信度分数，模型能够识别低质量的标记并重新掩码，从而在后续步骤中进行更丰富的采样。实验表明，RemeDi在多个数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs)难以修改错误的标记，一旦生成通常保持不变。关键挑战是识别输入中的潜在错误。

Method: RemeDi通过联合预测标记分布和每个标记的置信度分数，在每一步确定哪些标记需要解掩码，从而实现更灵活的文本优化。此外，设计了一个remask-aware管道进行训练，包括监督微调和强化学习。

Result: RemeDi在多个数据集上实现了开源DLM中的最先进结果。

Conclusion: RemeDi在多个数据集上实现了开源DLM中的最先进结果。

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

*Shulin Huang,Yiran Ding,Junshu Pan,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统地探讨了强化学习（RL）和监督微调（SFT）在跨语言推理泛化方面的表现。结果显示，RL不仅在准确性上优于SFT，而且在跨语言泛化方面也表现出更强的能力。此外，RL在非英语数据上的训练效果优于英语数据，而SFT则没有这种现象。通过机制分析，我们探索了RL优势和跨语言泛化的潜在因素。研究结果表明，RL能够使模型具备更稳健的推理策略，为多语言推理提供了重要指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强大型语言模型（LLMs）的复杂推理能力引起了广泛关注。虽然强化学习（RL）在提高复杂推理方面表现出色，但其对跨语言泛化的影响与监督微调（SFT）相比仍未被探索。

Method: 我们使用Qwen2.5-3B-Base作为基础模型，在多种多语言推理基准上进行了实验，包括数学推理、常识推理和科学推理。此外，我们还进行了全面的机制分析，以探索RL优势和跨语言泛化的潜在因素。

Result: 我们的研究得出了两个重要发现：(1) 与SFT相比，使用RL进行微调不仅实现了更高的准确性，还表现出显著更强的跨语言泛化能力。(2) 在非英语数据上进行RL训练比在英语数据上进行训练能获得更好的整体性能和泛化能力，而SFT中并未观察到这一现象。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果提供了有力的证据，表明强化学习（RL）使模型具备更稳健的推理策略，为更公平和有效的多语言推理提供了重要的指导。

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）由于英语中心的预训练和内部推理偏见，在高资源语言和中/低资源语言之间存在显著性能差距，这使得它们在全局企业应用中仍不可靠。这种不一致性在多语言环境中（如客户支持、内容审核和信息检索）会损害客户体验和操作可靠性。

Method: 我们提出了一种实用的、分批对齐策略，用于微调大型语言模型，利用每个训练批次中的语义等效多语言数据，直接在不同语言之间对齐模型输出。

Result: 这种方法在不损害英语性能、模型推理或检索质量的情况下，将非英语准确性提高了高达23.9%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法简单易实现，可扩展，并能无缝集成到现有的LLM训练和部署流程中，使行业中的多语言AI解决方案更加稳健和公平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,
scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TF-Bench，一个基于System F类型推断的基准，用于评估大型语言模型的推理能力。通过去除语义无关的自然语言，构建了TF-Bench_pure。分析显示，最先进的模型在TF-Bench_pure上的准确率仅为55.85%，并提出了两个新的度量标准来评估稳健性和测试时推理的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码推理的基准缺乏一个正式的、以程序为中心的演绎框架，无法确保合理的评估，并且无法评估模型是否真正关于程序语义进行推理，而只是利用自然语言和代码标记之间的表面关联。

Method: 我们引入了TF-Bench，这是一个基于System F类型推断的基准，用于评估大型语言模型的推理能力。通过使用经过验证的转换来去除语义无关的自然语言，我们构建了TF-Bench_pure，这是一个纯粹以语义驱动的TF-Bench变体。

Result: 我们的分析揭示了最先进的大型语言模型的显著局限性，最佳性能的模型（Claude-3.7-sonnet）在TF-Bench_pure上的准确率仅为55.85%。此外，我们提出了两个新的度量标准来评估稳健性和测试时推理的有效性，强调了当前大型语言模型能力的关键限制，并突出了未来研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future
research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied
agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet,
evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded
benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in
human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired
with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for
decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven
Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial
and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns
and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and
multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance
improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model
limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more
robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态知识图谱补全方法M-Hyper，通过结合融合和独立模态表示的优势，实现了有效的跨模态交互，同时保持了模态特定信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态知识图谱补全方法存在两种问题：基于融合的方法会丢失模态特定信息，缺乏适应不同模态相关性的灵活性；而基于集成的方法虽然保留了模态独立性，但难以捕捉模态间的细微、上下文依赖的语义互动。因此，本文旨在解决这些双重限制。

Method: 本文受四元数代数的启发，利用其四个正交基来表示多个独立模态，并使用Hamilton乘积来高效建模它们之间的成对交互。引入了细粒度实体表示分解（FERF）模块和鲁棒的关系感知模态融合（R2MF）模块，以获得三个独立模态和一个融合模态的稳健表示。最终的四种模态表示被映射到双四元数的四个正交基中进行全面的模态交互。

Result: 实验结果表明，M-Hyper方法在多模态知识图谱补全任务中表现出了最先进的性能、鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的多模态知识图谱补全方法M-Hyper，能够实现融合和独立模态表示的共存与协作。实验表明该方法在性能、鲁棒性和计算效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究对于增加模态是否有助于或损害性能存在矛盾的报告，因此我们需要一个受控的评估框架来分析模型内部以确定模态交互何时支持或削弱推理。

Method: 我们通过一个基于逻辑的评估框架来分析多模态推理，该框架将多模态推理分为六种交互模式，并通过实验验证了不同模态对推理的影响。

Result: 额外的模态仅在提供独立且充分的推理路径时才会增强推理，而冗余或链式蕴含支持通常会损害性能。此外，推理在三个方面系统性地退化：较弱的模态拉低整体性能，冲突偏向某些模态，不同模态的联合信号无法有效整合。

Conclusion: 我们的研究显示，整合而不是感知是多模态推理的主要障碍，这表明需要关注任务组合训练和早期融合控制。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的强化学习框架KLCF，旨在解决大型语言模型在长文本生成中的幻觉和事实性缺陷问题。KLCF通过知识一致性优化和双事实对齐机制，提高了事实性指标并缓解了模型幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉和事实性缺陷仍然是大型语言模型（LLMs）在长文本生成中的关键障碍。现有的基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）框架主要依赖于偏好奖励，但常常忽视模型的内部知识边界，加剧了所谓的“幻觉税”。

Method: 我们提出了知识级一致性强化学习框架（KLCF），该框架专注于策略模型表达的知识与基础模型的参数知识之间的知识一致性，并引入了双事实对齐机制来共同优化事实回忆和精度。KLCF利用预训练的知识边界构建事实清单，指导在线强化学习以提高事实覆盖率和回忆；同时，它基于基础模型的内部知识训练一个自我评估模块，以在生成过程中提高事实精度。

Result: 实验结果表明，KLCF在多个长文本基准测试中显著提高了事实性指标，并有效缓解了模型幻觉。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，KLCF在多个长文本基准测试中显著提高了事实性指标，并有效缓解了模型幻觉。

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM个性化方法在面对冷启动用户和具有丰富但偏斜历史的用户时效果不佳，这源于无法建模跨用户的集体知识。

Method: 提出了一种局部-全局记忆框架（LoGo），结合了个性化局部记忆和捕捉共享兴趣的集体全局记忆，并引入了一个调解模块来解决局部和全局信号之间的冲突。

Result: 在多个基准测试中进行的广泛实验表明，LoGo能够一致地提高个性化质量，既解决了冷启动用户的问题，又缓解了偏差预测。

Conclusion: LoGo框架通过结合个性化局部记忆和集体全局记忆，有效解决了冷启动问题和偏差问题，表明引入集体知识对于增强LLM个性化的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为KAPPA的方法，用于解决大型语言模型在多项选择题上的知识-预测差距问题。该方法通过调整隐藏状态来对齐模型的预测和知识坐标，从而提高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了调查MCQ上知识-预测差距的机制并缓解它，我们进行了探测分析，并发现某些层中的残留流包含由两个重要基础张成的子空间：一个编码给定MCQ的正确答案的概率的知识基础，另一个编码模型预测的答案选择的概率的预测基础。

Method: 我们引入了KAPPA（通过基于投影的调整进行知识对齐预测），这是一种参数无关的干预方法，它通过在这个子空间内将预测坐标与知识坐标对齐来转换隐藏状态。

Result: 在二元选择的Big-Bench-Hard和ARC-Challenge的重新表述上进行的实验表明，KAPPA显著提高了准确性，并且始终优于基线。虽然最佳子空间因任务而异，但子空间在一定程度上具有通用性，这得到了跨数据集实验的支持。此外，KAPPA的有效性还扩展到了MCQ以外的自由形式问题。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了对知识-预测差距的新几何理解，并提供了一种实用的方法，以更好地将模型行为与其潜在知识对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the QIAS 2025 shared task on Islamic
knowledge understanding and reasoning. We developed a hybrid
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines sparse and dense
retrieval methods with cross-encoder reranking to improve large language model
(LLM) performance. Our three-stage pipeline incorporates BM25 for initial
retrieval, a dense embedding retrieval model for semantic matching, and
cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach
on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the
proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accuracy
improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best
configuration is achieved with Fanar, yielding accuracy scores of 45% in
Subtask 1 and 80% in Subtask 2.

*Arti Rani,Shweta Singh,Nihar Ranjan Sahoo,Gaurav Kumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Open-DeBias方法，通过引入OpenBiasBench基准，解决了文本问答中的开放集偏见检测和缓解问题，并在多个NLP任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法通常局限于预定义类别，限制了它们解决新型或特定上下文出现的偏见的能力。本文旨在填补这一差距，解决文本问答中的开放集偏见检测和缓解问题。

Method: 本文引入了OpenBiasBench基准，用于评估各种类别和子群体中的偏见，并提出了一种名为Open-DeBias的新颖、数据高效且参数高效的去偏方法，利用适配器模块来减轻现有的社会和刻板偏见并推广到未见过的偏见。

Result: 与最先进的BMBI方法相比，Open-DeBias在BBQ数据集上将QA准确性提高了近48%（在模糊子集上）和6%（在消歧子集上），仅使用一小部分训练数据微调适配器。此外，相同的适配器在零样本转移到韩语BBQ时达到84%的准确率，证明了其语言无关的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Open-DeBias方法，该方法在多种NLP任务中表现出色，展示了其在通用、开放领域偏见缓解中的适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

*Ziyi Yang,Weizhou Shen,Ruijun Chen,Chenliang Li,Fanqi Wan,Ming Yan,Xiaojun Quan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPELL, a self-play reinforcement learning framework for improving long-context reasoning in LLMs without relying on human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving long-context reasoning in LLMs due to the lack of reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals.

Method: SPELL is a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning framework that integrates questioner, responder, and verifier roles within a single model to enable continual self-improvement.

Result: Experiments on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL improves performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned on large-scale annotated data. It achieves a 7.6-point gain in pass@8 on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking.

Conclusion: SPELL demonstrates significant improvements in long-context reasoning for LLMs, showing promise for scaling to more capable models.

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

*Shaobo Wang,Jiaming Wang,Jiajun Zhang,Cong Wang,Yue Min,Zichen Wen,Fei Huang,Huiqiang Jiang,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Q-Tuning, a dynamic pruning approach that improves data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning of large language models by jointly optimizing sample and token pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data efficiency has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to jointly optimize both dimensions.

Method: We introduce the Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning.

Result: Our method sets a new state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B, Q-Tuning achieves a +38% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline using only 12.5% of the original training data.

Conclusion: Q-Tuning provides a practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in budget-constrained LLM SFT.

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

### [91] [DocPruner: A Storage-Efficient Framework for Multi-Vector Visual Document Retrieval via Adaptive Patch-Level Embedding Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23883)
*Yibo Yan,Guangwei Xu,Xin Zou,Shuliang Liu,James Kwok,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocPruner is a framework that reduces storage overhead in Visual Document Retrieval by adaptively pruning redundant patch-level embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent state-of-the-art methods for VDR use multi-vector paradigms that introduce prohibitive storage overhead, making large-scale deployment costly and impractical.

Method: DocPruner employs adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR, leveraging the intra-document patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant embeddings.

Result: DocPruner achieves a significant 50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible degradation in document retrieval performance.

Conclusion: DocPruner offers a robust, flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale VDR systems.

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

*Jingyi Yang,Guanxu Chen,Xuhao Hu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对掩码扩散语言模型的新方法，通过特定的解码调度器和强化学习算法，提高了模型的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MDLMs具有并行解码、灵活生成顺序等优势，但现有的解码策略和强化学习算法尚未得到充分探索。直接转移AR模型的技术可能不是最优的，因此需要针对MDLMs进行专门优化。

Method: 本文提出了EOSER和ASS解码调度器，以及CJ-GRPO算法，以解决MDLMs在解码策略和强化学习算法上的不足。

Result: 实验结果表明，EOSER、ASS和CJ-GRPO方法在数学和规划基准测试中表现出色，能够有效地控制MDLMs。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种有效且高效地控制掩码扩散语言模型的方法，通过引入EOS Early Rejection (EOSER)和Ascending Step-Size (ASS)解码调度器以及Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)，在推理任务中取得了显著的成果。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究大多将未来事件预测视为静态任务，未能考虑预测和信心应如何随着新证据的出现而演变。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种评估大型语言模型在面对新信息时是否能正确修订预测的方法。

Method: 本文引入了EVOLVECAST框架，用于评估大型语言模型是否能根据新信息适当修订其预测。通过将人类预测者作为比较参考，分析在更新情境下的预测变化和置信度校准。

Result: 实验结果显示，大型语言模型在面对新信息时表现出一定的响应性，但更新通常不一致或过于保守。同时，无论是口头表达还是基于logits的置信度估计，都没有 consistently 超过人类参考标准。

Conclusion: 本文指出，尽管大型语言模型在面对新信息时表现出一定的响应性，但它们的更新通常不一致或过于保守。此外，无论是口头表达还是基于logits的置信度估计，都没有 consistently 超过人类参考标准，这表明需要更稳健的信念更新方法。

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种开源、模块化的对话轮次检测模型Easy Turn，结合了声学和语言双模态信息，能够预测四种对话轮次状态，并发布了1,145小时的语音数据集。与现有开源模型相比，该模型在轮次检测任务上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工交互对于自然的人机通信至关重要，但需要可靠的轮次检测来决定系统何时应说话、倾听或保持沉默。现有解决方案要么依赖专用的轮次检测模型，这些模型大多未开源；要么受限于参数量大或仅支持单一模态（如声学或语言）。此外，一些方法通过微调大型语言模型（LLM）来实现全双工能力，但这需要大量的全双工数据，而这些数据在开源中仍然稀缺。

Method: 本文提出了Easy Turn模型，该模型结合了声学和语言双模态信息，用于预测四种对话轮次状态：完整、不完整、反馈和等待。同时，发布了Easy Turn trainset数据集以支持模型训练。

Result: 与现有的开源模型如TEN Turn Detection和Smart Turn V2相比，Easy Turn模型在公开的Easy Turn测试集中实现了最先进的轮次检测准确率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Easy Turn的开源、模块化的对话轮次检测模型，能够集成声学和语言双模态信息来预测四种对话轮次状态，并发布了用于训练的1,145小时语音数据集。与现有的开源模型相比，该模型在公开的Easy Turn测试集中实现了最先进的对话轮次检测准确率。

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的机器口译系统是单模态的，仅依赖语言信号进行翻译，这在需要额外线索（如视觉、情境或语用信息）的情况下会限制性能。

Method: 本文介绍了Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI)，一种结合视觉语言模型处理语音和视觉输入的原型系统，以通过上下文视觉信息来引导翻译过程。

Result: 视觉基础显著提高了词汇消歧，对性别解析有适度且不稳定的增益，对句法歧义没有好处。

Conclusion: 拥抱多模态是提升机器口译翻译质量的必要步骤。

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and higher inference costs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ByteSized32Refactored，一个重构、模块化和可扩展的实现，用于探索文本游戏生成任务。通过优化代码结构和创建基础库，减少了代码行数并提高了可扩展性。实验显示生成质量在部分维度上有所提升，但也面临新的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟交互式世界模型仍然是大型语言模型（LLMs）的核心挑战。本文旨在通过重构和优化代码结构，提高文本游戏生成的质量和可扩展性。

Method: 我们引入了ByteSized32Refactored，这是原始ByteSized32语料库的重构、模块化和可扩展实现，用于探索文本游戏生成的任务。我们进一步优化了每个文本游戏的代码结构，并创建了GameBasic.py基础库，通过抽象7个基类（GameObject等）为可重用模块，从而将总Python代码行数从20k减少到10k。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，使用ByteSized32Refactored生成的文本游戏在未见过的场景中，在四个评估维度中有两个维度的质量有所提高，而另外两个维度则有所下降，这表明重构代码的层次结构给LLMs带来了新的挑战。

Conclusion: 我们强调，以基础库和模块化优化为中心的可扩展代码结构，不仅有助于LLM适应环境规范，还建立了一个可扩展的环境，支持未来的扩展。

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models.

Method: Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals encoded in the residual streams of LLMs.

Result: PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better with huge time savings.

Conclusion: PaLRS offers an effective, much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for alignment with minimal data.

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and

distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

*Gauri Kholkar,Ratinder Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的方法'Policy as Prompt'，利用大型语言模型将自然语言政策转化为可验证的实时防护措施，从而提高了AI的安全性和可监管性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主AI代理在工业中越来越广泛地部署，保护它们变得至关重要。现有的方法在将政策转化为实际实施方面存在差距，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的方法，称为'Policy as Prompt'，该方法使用大型语言模型（LLMs）通过应用上下文理解和最小特权原则来解释和执行自然语言政策。我们的系统首先获取技术工件以构建可验证的策略树，然后将其编译成轻量级的基于提示的分类器，在运行时审核代理行为。

Result: 我们在各种应用中验证了我们的方法，展示了可扩展且可审计的管道，能够有效地将政策转化为实际实施。

Conclusion: 我们的方法展示了可扩展且可审计的管道，弥合了政策与实践之间的关键差距，为可验证的安全和更可监管的AI铺平了道路。

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time
guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by
applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit
agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse
applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more
regulatable AI.

TL;DR: MCPMark is a new benchmark designed to evaluate how well LLMs can interact with external systems in realistic and complex workflows, revealing the limitations of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCP benchmarks are narrow in scope, focusing on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.

Method: The paper proposes MCPMark, a benchmark consisting of 127 high-quality tasks created by domain experts and AI agents, with each task including a programmatic script for automatic verification.

Result: The best-performing model, gpt-5-medium, reaches only 52.56% pass@1 and 33.86% pass^4, while other strong models fall below 30% pass@1 and 15% pass^4. On average, LLMs require 16.2 execution turns and 17.4 tool calls per task.

Conclusion: MCPMark is a challenging benchmark that highlights the limitations of current LLMs in handling complex and realistic workflows involving rich interactions with external systems.

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

TL;DR: SDLM通过引入NSP，解决了DLMs的固定长度解码和KV缓存不兼容问题，实现了高效的序列生成，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models (DLMs)虽然理论上效率高，但受限于固定长度解码和与键值（KV）缓存的不兼容性。Block diffusion虽缓解了这些问题，但仍强制固定块大小并需要昂贵的训练。

Method: NSP（Next Sequence Prediction）统一了下一个token和下一个block的预测，使模型能够在每个步骤自适应地确定生成长度。基于NSP，提出了Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM)，可以在最小成本下改造预训练的自回归语言模型（ALMs）。

Result: 实验表明，SDLM仅使用3.5M训练样本即可与强大的自回归基线相媲美，同时比Qwen-2.5实现了2.1更高的吞吐量。特别是SDLM-32B模型展示了更显著的效率增益。

Conclusion: SDLM展示了其建模范式的强大可扩展性，特别是在处理不同不确定性和语义变化时的鲁棒性以及在保持KV缓存兼容性方面的优势。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

### [103] [SparseD: Sparse Attention for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24014)
*Zeqing Wang,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SparseD, a novel sparse attention method for diffusion language models that reduces inference latency by leveraging head-specific sparsity patterns and using full attention in early denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source DLMs suffer from high inference latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention with respect to context length. Sparse attention methods designed for ARs are incompatible with DLMs as they fail to capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation in early denoising steps.

Method: SparseD is a novel sparse attention method for DLMs that leverages observations about sparsity behaviors, pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns once and reusing them across all steps, while using full attention in early denoising steps and switching to sparse attention later.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to 1.50× speedup over FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

Conclusion: SparseD is a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in long-context applications, achieving lossless acceleration with up to 1.50× speedup over FlashAttention.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

TL;DR: ResFormer is a new neural network architecture that efficiently models varying context lengths by combining reservoir computing and traditional Transformers, achieving significant performance improvements and reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of Transformer-based models due to quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a cascaded methodology.

Method: ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with fixed-length inputs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD, and IEMOCAP.

Conclusion: ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual information.

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to

extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于Transformer的集成模型和大型语言模型（LLM），用于其他语言的情感分析。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在情感分析性能上超过了86%。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在特定任务要求下的生成能力，而我们引入了LSCG问题，以评估LLM解析大量细粒度通用约束的能力。

Method: 我们创建了一个名为Words Checker的实际LSCG实例，并提出了FoCusNet模型来解析原始约束列表，帮助LLM专注于相关约束。

Result: 实验结果显示，随着约束数量的增加，现有解决方案的性能显著下降，而FoCusNet在准确率上有所提升。

Conclusion: 实验表明，现有的解决方案在约束数量增加时性能显著下降，而FoCusNet显示出8-13%的准确率提升。

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEAR is a new evaluation paradigm for abductive reasoning that scores hypothesis sets based on consistency, generalizability, and diversity. It provides label-free, scalable training signals that improve LLMs' ability to generate diverse and reliable hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The central question is whether large language models can discover new knowledge and how to evaluate this ability. Abductive reasoning is studied as the generation of plausible hypotheses to explain observations.

Method: GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics: consistency, generalizability, and diversity. It also proposes a momentum-based curriculum that adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity.

Result: Using GEAR, a fine-grained study of nine LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems was conducted, generating over 50,000 candidate hypotheses. The momentum-based curriculum improved all GEAR objectives and transferred to established abductive reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more diverse and reliable hypotheses.

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的偏见测试框架BTC-SAM，利用大型语言模型生成高质量的测试用例，以减少对领域专家和众包的依赖，并提高测试覆盖率。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道德推理已成为大型语言模型研究的一个有前途的方向，但实现泛化仍然是一个核心挑战。从语言学的角度来看，这种困难源于大型语言模型擅长捕捉分布语义，而道德则在语用层面运作。

Method: 本文提出了基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，利用每一步的上下文信息来弥合语用差距，并引导大型语言模型将道德基础与道德推理目标联系起来。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法显著提升了大型语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，能够显著提升大型语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力，并为未来基于道德基础理论的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的提示优化框架，旨在提高提示在改写下的鲁棒性，通过减少文本锐度差距，从而在保持准确性的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法主要关注点对点的准确性，很少强制改写不变性或搜索稳定性，因此无法在实践中修复这种脆弱性。自动提示搜索仍然脆弱：小的、语义保留的改写经常导致性能波动。

Method: 我们提出了TARE（Textual Sharpness-Aware Evolving），这是一种无需导数的框架，交替进行基于采样的对抗性搜索和稳健选择。我们还提出了ATARE，它学习各向异性的权重来塑造语义邻域，并随时间调整半径以平衡探索和保真度。

Result: 我们在多种任务中评估了我们的方法，结果表明，我们的方法在保持准确性的同时，优于仅关注准确性的提示搜索，同时保持计算上的实用性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法设计旨在最小化文本锐度差距，从而生成在改写下保持准确性的提示，优于仅关注准确性的提示搜索，同时保持计算上的实用性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

TL;DR: LOT is a method that compares the reasoning of large reasoning models and identifies systematic differences in their thinking patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs reason differently remains an open question.

Method: LOT is a classification method that uses a generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and articulate their distinctive features in words. It models how these features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical distributions across LRM outputs.

Result: LOT identifies systematic differences in the thoughts of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in math, science, and coding, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain.

Conclusion: LOT can identify systematic differences in how LRMs reason and can be used to improve model performance by aligning reasoning styles.

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，用于分析大型语言模型中上下文学习的机制，通过识别专注于任务识别和任务学习的注意力头，并展示了它们在不同任务和设置中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们旨在通过调和两种主要观点：注意力头的组件级分析和ICL的全息分解为TR和TL，来研究大型语言模型中上下文学习（ICL）的机制基础。

Method: 我们提出了基于任务子空间逻辑归因（TSLA）的新框架，以识别专门用于TR和TL的注意力头，并通过相关分析、消融研究和输入扰动来验证它们的作用。

Result: 我们展示了识别出的TR和TL头独立且有效地捕捉了ICL的TR和TL组件，并揭示了TR头通过将隐藏状态与任务子空间对齐来促进任务识别，而TL头则在子空间内旋转隐藏状态以向正确标签靠近以促进预测。

Conclusion: 我们的框架提供了一个统一且可解释的账户，说明大型语言模型如何在各种任务和设置中执行ICL。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出直接训练LTVs，以提高任务向量的准确性和灵活性，并揭示了TVs在ICL中的机制作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常使用繁琐且不透明的方法从模型输出或隐藏状态中提取任务向量（TVs），并且很少阐明TVs如何影响计算。

Method: 直接训练Learned Task Vectors (LTVs)，并系统分析任务向量（TVs）的机制作用。

Result: LTVs在准确性上超过提取的TVs，并在任意层、位置甚至ICL提示下有效。低层次上，TVs主要通过注意力头OV电路引导预测，而高层次上，TV传播主要是线性的。

Conclusion: LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations of ICL.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

Motivation: The effectiveness of GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent complexity of these tasks.

Method: RAG-GUI is first warm-started via supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection sampling finetuning (RSF).

Result: Evaluated across three distinct tasks, RAG-GUI consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes.

Conclusion: RAG-GUI demonstrates strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world

Motivation: 由于传统准确度指标无法捕捉问题特征或提供特定主题的见解，因此需要一种可靠且准确的评估方法来评估LLMs在高风险医疗应用中的表现。

Method: 本文引入了\textsc{MedIRT}，这是一个基于项目反应理论（IRT）的评估框架，用于评估LLMs在医学应用中的表现。通过为每个主题使用一个单维两参数逻辑IRT模型，估计LLM的潜在模型能力以及问题难度和区分度。

Conclusion: 本文建立了一种基于心理测量学的稳健方法，对于在医疗保健中安全、有效和值得信赖地部署大型语言模型（LLMs）至关重要。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端生成范式在个性化方面存在局限性，其不透明的决策过程阻碍了全面的用户画像，并加剧了流行度偏差。因此，需要一种更透明、公平和多样化的个性化方法。

Method: PET框架通过将任务重新表述为在稳定且可解释的偏好聚类晶格上推断动态概率分布来解决这些问题。它应用了logit probing和生成分类技术来推断用户的偏好作为概率分布，从而实现透明的偏好学习。

Result: 在公共基准（Yelp、MovieLens）上，PET在NDCG上比直接生成基线提高了高达40%。在一个大规模的真实短视频平台数据集上，它在排名长尾内容方面表现出色，比最先进的生产模型在NDCG分数上高出7倍。

Conclusion: PET将用户资料模型从直接生成偏好列表转变为透明的分布偏好映射，为更可解释、公平和多样化的个性化系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability.

Method: AceSearcher is a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation. It couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10 datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. On document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented LLMs with up to 9x more parameters.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

Motivation: 随着静态基准测试的可用性增加，语言模型的公平评估变得越来越困难。由于这些基准测试可能受到训练数据的污染，因此难以判断模型是真正推理还是仅仅回忆答案。

Method: BeyondBench使用算法问题生成来创建数学基础的问题，从而避免了传统基准测试中因互联网规模训练数据而带来的污染风险。该框架涵盖了44个算法任务，分为三个难度级别，并且每个任务生成的问题空间非常大，解决方案通过数学证明进行验证。

Result: 评估了101个语言模型，包括85个开源模型和16个闭源模型，结果显示模型在面对复杂问题时性能急剧下降。在Hard Suite评估中，一些模型的平均准确率分别为56.38%、26.91%和33.60%。此外，没有使用工具的情况下，性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的评估框架BeyondBench，以解决静态基准测试可能被训练数据污染的问题。通过算法问题生成，确保了测试的更新和未污染。评估结果显示，模型在面对复杂问题时表现出明显的推理缺陷。

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

Conclusion: ScenarioBench 提供了一个政策基础、跟踪感知的基准，用于评估文本到SQL和检索增强生成在合规性情境中的表现。

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的框架MetaTuner，该框架结合了提示优化和微调，以提高大型语言模型的性能。实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准测试中均优于基线方法。

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

*Gyuhyeon Seo,Jungwoo Yang,Junseong Pyo,Nalim Kim,Jonggeun Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究介绍了SimuHome，一个基于Matter协议的高保真智能家庭模拟环境，并提供了一个包含600个情节的挑战性基准测试。评估结果显示，现有模型在处理复杂任务时表现不佳，强调了需要改进状态验证和时间调度方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发智能家庭代理面临的主要瓶颈包括缺乏一个现实的模拟环境以及一个具有挑战性的基准测试。因此，需要一个能够提供高保真环境并支持真实设备部署的解决方案。

Method: 引入了SimuHome，这是一个基于Matter协议的时间加速家庭环境，可以模拟智能设备，支持API调用，并反映环境变量的变化。此外，还提供了包含600个情节的挑战性基准测试，以评估智能家庭代理的能力。

Result: 在统一的ReAct框架下对11个代理的评估显示，尽管模型在简单任务上表现良好，但在隐含意图推理、状态验证和时间调度方面表现不佳。最先进的模型GPT-4.1的成功率仅为54%。

Conclusion: 研究发现，即使是最先进的模型在处理隐含意图推理、状态验证和时间调度方面也存在困难，这表明需要更可靠的方法来通过工具验证当前状态并协调时间依赖性动作。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架GIRCSE，通过自回归生成迭代精炼语义表示，取得了比现有方法更好的效果，并展示了生成更多标记能提升嵌入质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大型语言模型（LLM）的嵌入通常采用仅编码器范式，将LLM视为静态特征提取器，忽略了它们的核心生成优势。

Method: 我们引入了GIRCSE（生成性迭代精炼对比句子嵌入），这是一种利用自回归生成来迭代精炼语义表示的新框架。我们提出了一个迭代对比精炼（ICR）目标，以鼓励每个精炼步骤产生更好的表示。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，GIRCSE在MTEB基准和指令遵循任务上优于强大的LLM嵌入基线。此外，GIRCSE表现出一种新兴的测试时缩放特性：在推理时生成更多标记会稳步提高嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 我们的结果确立了生成性迭代精炼作为表示学习的新范式。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance
on expert-intensive manual coding presents a major scalability bottleneck.
Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a
structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic
clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research
without sacrificing theoretical nuance.

Motivation: 由于dLLM的迭代和并行生成机制，它们存在与传统自回归LLM不同的新型漏洞。本文旨在深入分析dLLM在越狱攻击中的漏洞，并提出有效的防御方法。

Method: 本文提出了DiffuGuard，它包含两个阶段：Stochastic Annealing Remasking和Block-level Audit and Repair。前者通过引入受控随机性来减轻贪婪选择偏差，后者利用内部模型表示进行自主风险检测和引导修正。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiffuGuard能够显著降低六种不同越狱方法的攻击成功率，从47.9%降至14.7%，同时保持模型的实用性和效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了DiffuGuard，这是一种无需训练的防御框架，通过双阶段方法有效减少了dLLM对越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持了模型的实用性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

<details>

Motivation: 高质量的多模态基准对于推动大型模型中的科学推理至关重要，但其手动创建成本高且不可扩展。为了克服这一瓶颈，我们探索了将文本仅问答对（TQAs）转化为高质量多模态问答对（MMQAs）的潜力。

Method: 我们开发了一个代理系统（Q-Mirror），通过将MMQA生成和评估整合到一个闭环中进行迭代优化，从而实现了我们的框架。

Result: 我们的实验表明，虽然最先进的模型可以生成MMQAs，但它们的输出仍然存在显著差距，这突显了可靠评估的必要性。我们进一步证明，顶级理解模型在MMQA质量评估中与人类判断高度一致。利用这两个见解，Q-Mirror代理将平均分数从78.90提高到85.22，通过率从72%提高到95%。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

Conclusion: 研究发现，内在和提示值机制部分共享关键组件，但也具有独特的元素，导致不同的价值可操控性和响应多样性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

TL;DR: SV enhances speculative decoding by dynamically predicting speculation accuracy and adapting verification length, leading to improved decoding efficiency without modifying existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of speculative decoding (SD) when speculation accuracy is low, which can offset the benefits of SD, especially at large batch sizes.

Method: SV introduces a companion model to estimate the alignment between draft and target model distributions, refining verification decisions to reduce wasted computation.

Result: SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding with the target model, improving SD performance by up to 2×, with an average speedup of 1.4× in large-batch settings.

Conclusion: SV demonstrates robustness, scalability, and practical utility for efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 现有的微调方法在非主导语言上的性能和跨语言对齐效果不佳，导致知识迁移不理想。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段的表示级框架AlignX，用于增强预训练LLMs的多语言性能。第一阶段通过多语言语义对齐和语言特征集成对齐多语言表示。第二阶段通过多语言指令微调刺激LLMs的多语言能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，AlignX能够提升LLMs的多语言泛化能力和跨语言生成能力，并使多语言表示更接近，改善跨语言对齐。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的方法增强了LLMs的多语言泛化和跨语言生成能力。进一步分析表明，AlignX使多语言表示更接近并改善了跨语言对齐。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

Method: 我们基于一对平行语料库进行研究，其中人类撰写的段落与LLM简化的变体对齐，并测试了四种数据调度：重复暴露、由低到高复杂度、由高到低和交错。

Result: 添加简化数据可以提高微调和零样本性能，相对于重复暴露基线。较小的模型从低到高复杂度的顺序中受益，而较大的模型则在交错顺序中表现更好。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，添加简化数据可以提高微调和零样本性能，相对于重复暴露基线。较小的模型从低到高复杂度的顺序中受益，而较大的模型则在交错顺序中表现更好。

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

Result: RMT在语言建模中实现了高达+64.91%的性能提升，同时仅使用了21%的推理长度。此外，经过强化中间训练的检查点在数学领域可以带来高达+18.76%的改进。

Conclusion: RMT框架在语言建模中实现了显著的性能提升，并且在后续的后训练阶段也表现出色。

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

Conclusion: 我们的实验发现，两个传统的度量标准——METEOR和ROUGE-1——在评估模型响应的有害性方面优于基于LLM的判断者，这挑战了关于LLM在此领域优越性的普遍信念。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

Result: LLaDA-MoE在多个基准测试中表现优于之前的扩散语言模型LLaDA、LLaDA 1.5和Dream，并且其指令调优模型LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct在知识理解、代码生成、数学推理、代理和对齐任务方面的能力可与Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct相媲美。

Conclusion: 将稀疏的MoE架构集成到掩码扩散语言模型的训练目标中，仍然能在使用少量激活参数的情况下展现出MoE的优势，并为扩散语言模型的进一步探索提供了充足的空间。

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE
models are available at Huggingface.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind
human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that
explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's
internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL,
a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance.
Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that
synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via
RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative
Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament
Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy
adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive
experiments show that Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves SOTA performance on the BIRD
benchmark, reaching 81.67\% execution accuracy on the test set and ranking
first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating an effective path toward

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MultiSpider 2.0，这是一个扩展到八种语言的文本到SQL基准测试，揭示了多语言之间的显著差距，并提出了一种协作驱动的语言代理基线以提高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到SQL使自然访问数据库成为可能，但大多数基准测试仅限于英语，限制了多语言进展。

Method: 我们引入了MultiSpider 2.0，将其扩展到八种语言（英语、德语、法语、西班牙语、葡萄牙语、日语、中文、越南语），同时保留Spider 2.0的结构难度，并增加了语言和方言的变异性，要求对复杂的SQL进行更深入的推理。我们提供了一个协作驱动的语言代理基线，通过迭代优化查询，提高了准确性。

Result: 最先进的LLMs（如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1）在依赖内在推理时，在此基准测试中的执行准确率仅为4%，而在MultiSpider 1.0上为60%。协作驱动的语言代理基线将准确率提高到15%。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了一个显著的多语言差距，并促使开发跨语言稳健且准备好用于现实世界企业部署的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CDT框架，以全面评估大型语言模型的能力，并在数据集评估和数据选择中取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往只关注孤立的能力，缺乏全面评估LLM能力的框架。

Method: 提出Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT)框架，通过认知理论扩展模型能力定义，并应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择。

Result: CDT能力指标与下游性能相关性良好，能支持有效的数据集分析和构建；在数据选择实验中，通用和特定基准得分分别提高了1.6和2.2点。

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了CDT的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了NTP的替代方法，将其分为五类，并提出一个分类法，以指导研究解决逐标记生成的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在描述NTP替代方法的新兴生态系统，并为研究解决逐标记生成的已知局限性的模型提供指导。

Method: 本文对NTP的替代方法进行了分类，将其分为五个主要类别：(1) 多标记预测；(2) 先计划后生成；(3) 潜在推理；(4) 连续生成方法；(5) 非Transformer架构。

Result: 本文提供了对NTP替代方法的全面综述，并提出了一个分类法，以帮助研究者开发新的变革性模型。

Conclusion: 本文通过综合这些方法的见解，提供了一个分类法，以指导研究解决逐标记生成已知局限性的模型，从而开发出用于自然语言处理的新一代变革性模型。

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

### [144] [Bias Mitigation or Cultural Commonsense? Evaluating LLMs with a Japanese Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24468)
*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了SOBACO基准，用于评估LLMs中的社会偏见和文化常识。结果表明，去偏方法会显著降低LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能，强调了开发考虑文化常识权衡的去偏方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究主要通过测量一般语言理解的任务来评估偏见缓解的影响，这些任务通常与社会偏见无关。相比之下，文化常识与社会偏见密切相关，因为两者都源于社会规范和价值观。偏见缓解对LLMs中文化常识的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 我们提出了SOBACO（SOcial BiAs和Cultural cOmmonsense基准），一个日本基准，旨在以统一格式评估LLMs中的社会偏见和文化常识。我们在SOBACO上评估了几种LLMs，以检查去偏方法如何影响LLMs中的文化常识。

Result: 我们的结果揭示了去偏方法会降低LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能（准确率最多下降75%）。

Conclusion: 我们的结果揭示了去偏方法会降低LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能（准确率最多下降75%）。这些结果突显了开发考虑与文化常识权衡的去偏方法的重要性，以提高LLMs的公平性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的对齐算法，用于更精确地分析神经网络在语音识别任务中的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐方法不适合精确的误差分析，需要更细粒度的误差分析来揭示罕见术语、命名实体和领域特定词汇中的重要误差。

Method: 本文提出了一种结合动态规划和束搜索评分的新对齐算法。

Result: 与传统文本对齐方法相比，本文的方法提供了更准确的个体错误对齐，从而实现了可靠的误差分析。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的对齐算法，可以更准确地对齐个别错误，从而实现可靠的错误分析。该算法通过PyPI提供。

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

Motivation: 现有缓解策略主要基于事后过滤，引入了显著的延迟或计算开销，并且与令牌级别的流式生成不兼容。此外，隐私侵犯内容在以往的研究中往往未得到充分关注。

Method: Self-Sanitize 是一种基于认知心理学的新型 LLM 驱动的缓解框架，包含一个轻量级的 Self-Monitor 模块和一个 Self-Repair 模块，用于实时监控和修复有害内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，Self-Sanitize 在最小开销下实现了优越的缓解性能，并且不会降低 LLM 的实用性。

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize 提供了一种实用且稳健的解决方案，以实现更安全的 LLM 部署。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

TL;DR: 本文分析了GRPO算法的三个挑战，并提出了GRPO-MA方法来解决这些问题，实验结果表明该方法在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析GRPO算法在训练链式思维推理中的三个挑战，并提出一种改进方法以解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为GRPO-MA的方法，该方法利用每个思维过程的多答案生成，以实现更稳健和高效的优化。

Result: GRPO-MA减少了梯度尖峰，并在多个任务中表现出更好的性能和训练效率。

Conclusion: GRPO-MA在数学、代码和多种多模态任务中显著提高了性能和训练效率，并且增加每种思维的答案数量可以持续提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SUIT的知识编辑方法，该方法通过识别和修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间来提高知识保留能力。实验结果表明，SUIT在多个模型上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识编辑方法在没有对键向量和值向量进行约束的情况下会导致编辑模型产生显著的扰动，因此需要一种更有效的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为SUIT的方法，该方法通过识别和修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间来实现知识编辑。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B、GPT-J-6B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验结果表明，SUIT在保持高编辑效果的同时显著提高了知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SUIT成功识别了与编辑相关的关键子空间，从而在保持高编辑效果的同时显著提高了知识保留能力。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型评估通常基于通用或特定领域的基准测试，这些测试往往缺乏对终端用户实际生活经验的支撑。在医疗等关键领域，需要评估能够反映日常需求、文化实践和复杂背景的方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种社区驱动的评估流程Samiksha，该流程与民间社会组织和社区成员共同创建，利用社区反馈来决定评估内容、构建基准以及评分方式。

Result: 本文在印度的医疗领域展示了这一方法，分析了当前多语言大型语言模型如何处理复杂的社区健康查询，并提供了一种可扩展的路径，以实现更具上下文依据和包容性的语言模型评估。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个社区驱动的评估流程Samiksha，旨在通过与民间社会组织和社区成员合作，提供更贴近实际需求、文化实践和复杂背景的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

*Shaohao Rui,Kaitao Chen,Weijie Ma,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med is a framework that enhances adaptive thinking in medical LLMs by using uncertainty-guided length calibration, reducing reasoning length without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable adaptive thinking in medical LLMs, where models think less for simpler questions and more for complex ones, to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.

Method: AdaThink-Med generates multiple candidate outputs, evaluates their correctness and uncertainty, and uses an uncertainty-guided length calibration module to estimate problem difficulty. It penalizes longer reasoning paths for low-difficulty, correct answers and encourages extending the chain of thought for high-difficulty, incorrect answers.

Result: AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation on six public medical QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med demonstrates the ability to dynamically suppress redundant reasoning processes by developing two distinct reasoning modes, 'non-thinking' and 'thinking', while achieving significant length reduction without major performance degradation.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

Result: 我们识别了VLMs中的视觉单词形式选择性单元，并证明有针对性的消融这些单元会导致阅读任务的特定损害，而一般的视觉和语言理解能力保持不变。

Conclusion: 我们的建模结果再现了阅读障碍的关键特征，并建立了一个计算框架来研究阅读障碍。

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

### [155] [Understanding the Dilemma of Unlearning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24675)
*Qingjie Zhang,Haoting Qian,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Minlie Huang,Ke Xu,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可解释的unlearning框架unPact，并发现现有方法要么不足以消除知识，要么过于破坏性，仍然存在可靠unlearning的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以追踪大型语言模型（LLMs）复杂架构中的知识，对unlearning机制的可解释性分析很少。我们旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 我们提出了unPact，这是一个可解释的框架，通过提示归因和贡献跟踪来进行unlearning。它量化每个提示标记对输出的影响，使预-和后-unlearning比较以揭示变化。

Result: 我们发现：(1) 通过干扰提示中的关键词焦点，unlearning似乎有效；(2) 大量知识并未真正被删除，可以通过简单地在提示中强调这些关键词来恢复，而无需修改模型权重；(3) 灾难性遗忘源于对所有标记的无差别惩罚。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，现有的unlearning方法要么不足以消除知识（知识可以通过强调关键词恢复），要么过于破坏性（导致一般性能崩溃），仍然存在可靠unlearning的差距。

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了单次响应LLM-as-a-judge评分的可靠性，并提出了一种基于模型内部信号的评分方法，该方法在多个基准测试中表现良好，能够提供更准确和稳定的评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨单次响应LLM-as-a-judge评分的可靠性，并试图在没有参考的情况下获得细粒度、确定性的评分。

Method: 研究提出了Latent Judges，从内部模型信号中推导标量评分，包括：(i) 整数评分的概率加权分数，(ii) “是”的验证器风格概率，以及(iii) 在评分位置上的模型激活训练的线性探测器。

Result: 在广泛的成对和单评分基准测试中，潜在方法与标准提示相匹配或超越，特别是在成对准确性以及与Best-of-N选择相关的列表排序方面有持续的增益。概率加权分数实现了最强的单评分相关性，而探测器在输出logits校准错误时恢复了有用信号。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，潜在信息可以为无参考评估提供确定性和更具区分性的信号，并可以改进选择和训练方法，如Best-of-N、多教师蒸馏和路由。

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

*Guibin Zhang,Muxin Fu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemGen is a dynamic generative memory framework that enables agents to recall and augment latent memory throughout reasoning, resulting in improved performance and the emergence of human-like memory faculties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing paradigms for agent memory are constrained by parametric memory and retrieval-based memory, which do not capture the fluid interweaving of reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. The goal is to address this gap by proposing a framework that mimics human cognitive faculties.

Method: MemGen is a dynamic generative memory framework that consists of a memory trigger and a memory weaver. The memory trigger monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, while the memory weaver constructs a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to 38.22%, exceeds GRPO by up to 13.44%, and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization ability.

Conclusion: MemGen surpasses existing external memory systems and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization ability. It spontaneously evolves human-like memory faculties, suggesting an emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic machine cognition.

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

TL;DR: Socratic-Zero是一种自动生成高质量训练数据的框架，通过三个代理的协同进化实现自我改进，无需预设任务或标签，在多个数学推理基准测试中表现出色，甚至超越了其他最先进的商业大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据合成或蒸馏方法在数据质量不一致和无法动态适应模型能力变化方面存在局限，导致训练信号不佳。因此，需要一种能够自动生成高质量数据并持续优化的框架。

Method: Socratic-Zero是一个完全自主的框架，通过三个代理（教师、求解器和生成器）的协同进化来生成高质量的训练数据。求解器通过学习成功和失败轨迹上的偏好反馈来不断改进其推理能力；教师根据求解器的弱点动态设计更具挑战性的问题；生成器则提炼教师的问题设计策略，以实现可扩展的高保真课程生成。

Result: 从仅100个种子问题开始，Socratic-Solver-8B在七个数学推理基准测试中平均提高了20.2个百分点，优于之前的数据合成方法。此外，Socratic-Generator-32B生成的合成数据使学生大语言模型在这些基准测试中的表现超过了其他最先进的商业大语言模型。

Conclusion: Socratic-Zero框架通过三个代理的协同进化，实现了高质量训练数据的自动生成，无需预设任务或标签。该方法在多个数学推理基准测试中表现出色，甚至超越了其他最先进的商业大语言模型。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,
and Claude-4.1-Opus.

TL;DR: ProxyAttn is a training-free sparse attention algorithm that improves the efficiency of Large Language Models by achieving more precise block estimation through compressed attention head dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks.

Method: ProxyAttn, a training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads.

Result: Experiments on a variety of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance loss.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法在偏好优化中存在正负样本质量相似的问题，这使得偏好学习变得复杂。

Method: SeaPO方法利用LLM中常见的三种错误类型，将特定的错误模式引入模型偏好优化，通过基于偏好的训练来减少这些错误的发生，从而提高模型性能。

Result: 在五个能力维度和不同模型规模（1.5B到14B）上的评估表明，生成的数据显著提高了整体模型性能，尤其是在真实性方面有5-10个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: SeaPO方法通过引入特定的错误模式，提高了模型在偏好优化中的性能，特别是在真实性方面有显著提升。

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

TL;DR: KnowGuard is a new approach that improves the ability of large language models to correctly abstain when there is insufficient medical information, leading to better diagnostic accuracy and fewer interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with abstentions, frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information. This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge boundaries with external medical evidences.

Method: KnowGuard, a novel investigate-before-abstain paradigm that integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making, consists of two key stages: evidence discovery and evidence evaluation.

Result: Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic accuracy by 3.93% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on average.

Conclusion: KnowGuard outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic accuracy by 3.93% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on average.

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

Motivation: 传统CD模型缺乏处理动态、非结构化对话的合适框架，并且难以从长对话中准确提取诊断语义。

Method: 我们适应了教育理论中的启动-回应-评价（IRE）框架，设计了一个针对对话的诊断框架，并开发了一种独特的基于图的编码方法，将教师问题与相关知识组件相结合，以更精确地捕获关键信息。

Result: 实验在三个真实对话数据集上进行，结果表明DiaCDM不仅显著提高了诊断准确性，还增强了结果的可解释性。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，DiaCDM不仅显著提高了诊断准确性，还增强了结果的可解释性，为教师提供了一种强大的工具来评估学生的认知状态。

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的规模不断扩大，推理期间键值（KV）缓存的内存占用已成为一个显著的瓶颈。现有的方法主要集中在单个提示内的KV缓存压缩或跨提示的共享前缀或频繁出现的文本片段的重用。然而，这些策略在提示语义相似但词汇不同的情况下受到限制，这在多文档摘要和对话代理等任务中经常发生。

Method: SemShareKV框架通过在语义相似的提示中重用KV缓存来加速LLM推理。它使用局部敏感哈希（LSH）进行模糊标记匹配，并结合旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）以更好地保留位置信息。

Result: 在多种摘要数据集上的实验表明，对于5k个标记的输入，速度提高了6.25倍，GPU内存使用量降低了42%，且质量下降可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了语义感知缓存共享在高效LLM推理中的潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域面临显著的性能挑战，状态最先进的模型在医疗编码任务中的准确率仅为45.9%。因此，需要一种能够系统分析错误并进行针对性干预的方法，以提高专业领域的AI性能。

Method: 该研究提出了一个分层错误纠正（HEC）框架，通过系统的错误分析和有针对性的干预策略来解决领域特定的AI限制。研究分析了四个专业领域的错误模式，并开发了一个三阶段的纠正框架，根据其层次重要性解决错误。

Result: 实验验证显示，在医疗转录、法律文档分类、政治偏见检测和法律推理任务中，框架表现出了持续的改进。跨模型验证显示平均提高了11.2个百分点。然而，分析表明在高基线任务中，分层干预可能会干扰有效的推理过程。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，系统性错误分析可以指导专业领域中有效的AI增强策略，特别是在中等基线任务中，同时强调了理解框架边界对于最佳部署的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了用于心理危机分类的统一分类法，整理了评估数据集，并建立了评估响应适当性的协议。结果显示，尽管LLM在处理明确的危机披露时表现良好，但仍存在重大风险，需要增强安全措施、改进危机检测和上下文感知干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏统一的危机分类法、强大的注释基准和基于临床最佳实践的实证评估，进展受到阻碍。

Method: 我们引入了一个统一的六类临床心理危机分类法，整理了一个多样化的评估数据集，并建立了一个专家设计的评估响应适当性的协议。我们系统地基准测试了三种最先进的LLM，以评估它们分类危机类型和生成安全、适当的响应的能力。

Result: 结果表明，虽然LLM在处理明确的危机披露时高度一致且通常可靠，但仍然存在重大风险。相当一部分响应被评定为不适当或有害，由开放权重模型生成的响应显示出比商业模型更高的失败率。我们还发现了处理间接或模糊的风险信号的系统性弱点，依赖于公式化和不真实的默认回复，并且经常与用户上下文不一致。

Conclusion: 我们的分类法、数据集和评估框架为持续的研究和负责任的创新奠定了基础，有助于减少伤害并更好地保护弱势用户。

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动识别隐喻方面的潜力，并比较了三种方法：检索增强生成（RAG）、提示工程和微调。结果显示，最先进的封闭源代码LLMs可以达到高准确性，微调的中位F1得分为0.79。研究认为LLMs可以用于至少部分自动化隐喻识别，并可以作为开发和精炼隐喻识别协议以及支撑它们的理论的试验场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻是话语中的普遍特征，也是研究认知、情感和意识形态的强大工具。然而，大规模分析受到需要人工标注的限制，因为隐喻具有上下文敏感性。本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在全文中自动识别隐喻的潜力。

Method: 本研究比较了三种方法：(i) 检索增强生成（RAG），其中模型提供了代码本并根据其规则和示例被指示注释文本；(ii) 提示工程，我们设计了特定任务的口头指令；以及 (iii) 微调，其中模型在手工编码的文本上进行训练以优化性能。在提示工程中，我们测试了零样本、少样本和思维链策略。

Result: 结果表明，最先进的封闭源代码LLMs可以达到高准确性，微调的中位F1得分为0.79。人类和LLM输出的比较显示，大多数差异是系统性的，反映了隐喻理论中已知的灰色区域和概念挑战。

Conclusion: 我们提出，LLMs 可以用于至少部分自动化隐喻识别，并可以作为开发和精炼隐喻识别协议以及支撑它们的理论的试验场。

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

### [169] [Expanding Computation Spaces of LLMs at Inference Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24884)
*Yoonna Jang,Kisu Yang,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了语言模型是否可以在推理时仅使用人工插入的填充标记序列。实验表明，适当类型的填充标记和数量因任务而异，但在最终'Answer:'标记前直接放置填充标记最为有效。较小的模型受益最大，这表明这些空间作为额外的计算能力而非冗余输入。注意力图显示，扩展的空间通常延续原始注意力机制，并有时关注问题或答案选项，表明对解决问题有意义的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought (CoT) 理由使语言模型能够使用额外的任务相关文本进行问题解决，不仅从详细的推理步骤中受益，还从更长输入的扩展计算空间中受益。先前的工作已经训练了填充标记或特殊标记来作为额外的计算空间。本研究旨在探讨语言模型是否可以在推理时仅使用人工插入的填充标记序列。

Method: 研究调查了语言模型是否可以在推理时仅使用人工插入的填充标记序列。首先确定了有效的标记类型、数量和插入位置，然后检查模型在训练的哪个阶段开始利用扩展的计算空间，并通过注意力图分析这些空间内的动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，适当的标记类型和数量因任务而异，但在最终'Answer:'标记前直接放置填充标记最为有效。较小的模型受益最大，最多提高了12.372个百分点。注意力图显示，扩展的空间通常延续原始注意力机制，并有时关注问题或答案选项，表明对解决问题有意义的计算。

Conclusion: 实验表明，适当类型的填充标记和数量因任务而异，但在最终'Answer:'标记前直接放置填充标记最为有效。较小的模型受益最大，这表明这些空间作为额外的计算能力而非冗余输入。注意力图显示，扩展的空间通常延续原始注意力机制，并有时关注问题或答案选项，表明对解决问题有意义的计算。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

TL;DR: 本研究构建了一个西班牙官方公报的摘要数据集，并表明微调的大型语言模型在摘要任务中表现优于通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于信息过载，需要能够简洁总结长文档的能力，但目前缺乏针对西班牙语文档，特别是法律领域的摘要。

Method: 本研究提出了BOE-XSUM数据集，并评估了微调的中型大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本设置下的性能，与通用生成模型进行比较。

Result: 微调的模型显著优于非专业模型，其中最佳模型BERTIN GPT-J 6B（32位精度）比顶级零样本模型DeepSeek-R1在准确率上高出24%（41.6% vs. 33.5%）。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了BOE-XSUM数据集的有效性，并表明微调的大型语言模型在摘要任务上优于通用生成模型。

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

*Rebira Jemama,Rajesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的框架，用于作者验证和风格模仿分析，结果显示提示策略对风格保真度的影响大于模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可以生成流畅的文本，但它们复制特定人类作者独特风格的能力尚不清楚。

Method: 该方法将TF-IDF字符n-gram与transformer嵌入相结合，并通过经验距离分布对文本对进行分类，无需监督训练或阈值调整。

Result: 该框架在学术论文上达到了97.5%的准确率，在跨领域评估中达到了94.5%。使用该框架，我们评估了三个不同家族（Llama、Qwen、Mixtral）的五个LLM，结果表明提示策略对风格保真度的影响比模型大小更大。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，风格保真度和统计可检测性是可分离的，为未来在作者建模、检测和身份条件生成方面的工作奠定了可重复的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: 本文表明，通过精心策划和重新采样高质量的开源数据集，可以在较少的数据量下实现强大的推理能力。MobileLLM-R1系列模型在多个推理基准测试中表现出色，甚至可以与更大规模的模型相媲美。

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

Motivation: 尽管AI医生在诊断技能方面取得了进展，但其他重要品质如同理心、耐心和清晰沟通仍被忽视。为了弥补这一差距，本文旨在提供一个全面评估医疗多轮提问的基准和框架。

Method: 本文介绍了MAQuE（Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation），这是最大的医疗多轮提问自动综合评估基准。该基准包含3000个真实模拟的患者代理，展示了多样的语言模式、认知限制、情感反应和被动披露倾向。同时，本文还引入了一个多维评估框架，涵盖任务成功、提问熟练度、对话能力、提问效率和患者体验。

Result: 实验结果显示，不同大型语言模型在评估各个方面都面临重大挑战。即使是最先进的模型，在提问能力方面仍有显著改进空间。这些模型对现实患者行为的变化高度敏感，这显著影响了诊断准确性。此外，细粒度的评估指标揭示了不同评估视角之间的权衡，突显了在实际临床环境中平衡性能和实用性的挑战。

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有的防御措施主要关注用户行为，而忽略了项目侧特征，如标题和描述，这些特征可以暴露恶意意图。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段检测框架，通过大型语言模型（LLMs）整合项目侧语义。第一阶段使用低成本行为标准预筛选可疑用户，第二阶段使用基于LLM的审计来评估语义一致性。此外，通过在轻量级LLM上进行强化微调，增强了审计模型。

Result: 实验结果表明SemanticShield对六种代表性的攻击策略有效，并且在之前未见过的攻击方法上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 实验表明SemanticShield在对抗洗牌攻击方面有效，并且在之前未见过的攻击方法上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过系统编码正确性历史来实现可靠的大型语言模型置信度估计，而不是依赖模型自身的自我反思。


<details>

Motivation: 生成准确且校准的置信度估计对于在高风险或面向用户的应用中部署大型语言模型至关重要，但仍然是一个开放挑战。

Method: 提出多种方法注入目标模型的历史正确性信息，创建广义正确性模型（GCM）。通过训练GCM来学习跨数据集和模型的正确性预测模式，并使用CM作为研究正确性预测能力来源的工具，同时探索无需训练语言模型的替代方法。

Result: GCM可以在多个大型语言模型上进行训练，并学习适用于不同数据集和模型的正确性预测模式。答案的表达方式是正确性的一个强预测因素。包含历史作为上下文示例可以提高正确性预测，后处理校准可以提供互补的校准误差减少。

Conclusion: 可靠的大型语言模型置信度估计是一种可以通过系统编码正确性历史而非依赖自我反思的通用且模型无关的技能。

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

Motivation: 传统模型蒸馏通常专注于行为模仿，即学生模型被训练以复制教师模型的输出，而将内部计算视为黑盒。本文旨在提出一种替代方法，即蒸馏教师模型实现的底层计算机制。

Method: 本文提出了电路蒸馏方法，该方法引入了一个目标，以对齐教师模型和学生模型中类似电路组件之间的内部表示。此外，还提出了一种匹配功能对应的电路组件的方法，并引入了一个反映这些组件所诱导表示相似性的损失函数。

Result: 在使用Llama3系列模型进行实体跟踪和心智理论（ToM）任务的评估中，电路蒸馏的结果表明其优于标准蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了通过调整学生模型中一小部分有针对性的参数，可以成功地转移算法能力，这为通过可解释和可控的内部学生机制高效地蒸馏特定教师能力提供了可能性。

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

Motivation: 在AI时代，快速生成语言文本是人们追求的圣杯。本文旨在引入一种新的方法，以提高语言生成的速度和效果。

Method: DiDi-Instruct 是一种基于训练的方法，通过从预训练的离散扩散语言模型（dLLM）初始化来实现快速语言生成模型。

Result: DiDi-Instruct 模型在OpenWebText上优于所有加速的语言生成模型以及GPT-2基线和标准dLLMs，实现了从62.2（8 NFEs）到18.4（128 NFEs）的样本困惑度。

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct 是一种高效且有效的蒸馏方法，使语言生成变得迅速。

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Conclusion: GateMABSA在两个基准Twitter数据集上的实验表明，它优于多个基线模型。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

*Marco Bronzini,Carlo Nicolini,Bruno Lepri,Jacopo Staiano,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的解码LLM向量空间信息的方法，称为Hyperdimensional Probe，能够提取有意义的概念并帮助识别LLM的失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释性方法（如直接logit归因和稀疏自编码器）由于模型的输出词汇或不清楚的特征名称而提供有限的见解。

Method: 该方法结合了符号表示和神经探测的思想，通过Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs)将模型的残差流投影到可解释的概念上。

Result: 实验表明，该探针能够在各种LLM、嵌入大小和输入领域中可靠地提取有意义的概念。

Conclusion: 本工作提出了Hyperdimensional Probe，这是一种新的解码LLM向量空间信息的范式，能够可靠地提取有意义的概念，并帮助识别LLM的失败。

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型作为自动语音识别的后处理模块，通过置信度感知提示提高鲁棒性和泛化能力，结果表明该方法在两个数据集上均有效减少了错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自动语音识别（ASR）的后处理模块，重点关注它们对混乱语音进行错误纠正的能力。

Method: 我们提出了置信度感知提示，其中将词级不确定性估计直接嵌入到LLM训练中，以提高跨说话人和数据集的鲁棒性和泛化能力。我们微调了一个LLaMA 3.1模型，并将我们的方法与仅转录微调和事后基于置信度的过滤进行了比较。

Result: 我们的方法在Speech Accessibility Project的自发语音上实现了相对于简单LLM纠正的10%相对WER减少，在TORGO上实现了47%的减少。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在Speech Accessibility Project的自发语音上实现了相对于简单LLM纠正的10%相对WER减少，在TORGO上实现了47%的减少，证明了针对受损语音的置信度感知微调的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer在程序跟踪生成任务中的应用，发现虽然模型在分布内表现良好，但在泛化到不同因素时存在系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们研究了Transformer在程序跟踪生成（PTG）任务上的应用，其中模型为合成程序生成逐步执行跟踪。与现有的算法问题不同，PTG通过长跟踪外部化推理，每个步骤都是微不足道的。

Method: 我们训练了具有多种修改的小型Transformer，包括替代位置编码、softmax替换、混合模型和短卷积。

Result: 这些模型在分布内准确性方面表现强劲，但在泛化到各种因素时表现出系统性失败，尽管某些设计显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 尽管这些模型在分布内准确性表现良好，但它们在泛化到各种因素（例如程序长度、跟踪步骤）时表现出系统性失败，尽管某些设计显著提高了泛化能力。

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to
various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs
significantly improve generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DataMind的新方法，用于构建通用的数据分析代理。通过解决数据资源不足、训练策略不当和不稳定代码多轮滚动等问题，DataMind在多个数据分析基准上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法依赖于提示工程，而开源模型难以应对多样化格式、大规模数据文件和长周期多步骤推理的需求。因此，需要一种新的方法来构建通用的数据分析代理。

Method: DataMind通过细粒度任务分类法、递归易到难任务组合机制、知识增强轨迹采样策略、基于模型和规则的过滤、动态调整的训练目标以及内存节省且稳定的代码多轮滚动框架来解决开放源代码数据分析代理的三个关键挑战。

Result: DataMind-14B在多个数据分析基准上取得了71.16%的平均分数，超过了DeepSeek-V3.1和GPT-5等最强的专有基线模型。DataMind-7B在所有开源模型中表现最佳，得分为68.10%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了DataMind，一种可扩展的数据合成和代理训练方法，用于构建通用的数据分析代理。通过DataMind-12K数据集和DataMind-14B模型，实现了最先进的性能，并在多个数据分析基准上优于现有的专有基线模型。

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高文档重排序的效率和性能，同时减少模型的规模。

Method: jina-reranker-v3 引入了一种新的 'last but not late interaction' 方法，通过在同一个上下文窗口内对查询和文档进行因果自注意力计算，实现丰富的跨文档交互。

Result: jina-reranker-v3 在 BEIR 基准测试中取得了 61.94 nDCG@10 的成绩，比生成性列表重排序器小十倍。

Conclusion: jina-reranker-v3 是一个高效的多语言文档重排序模型，具有最先进的 BEIR 性能，并且比生成性列表重排序器小十倍。

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that
introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction
models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector
matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and
documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document
interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of
each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR
performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative
listwise rerankers.

*Akio Hayakawa,Stefan Bott,Horacio Saggion*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于小型LLM的高效LS系统框架，通过知识蒸馏和上下文学习进行探索。实验表明，虽然知识蒸馏提高了自动度量分数，但也增加了有害简化。研究还提出了一种过滤策略，以抑制有害简化而保留有益简化，为高效和安全的LS提供了基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于脆弱用户群体（例如残疾人）是这项技术的关键目标群体，因此确保LS系统的输出的安全性和正确性至关重要。此外，在隐私敏感和资源受限的环境中，大型语言模型（LLMs）在实际应用中面临挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一个高效的LS系统框架，利用可部署在本地环境中的小型LLM。在该框架中，我们探索了知识蒸馏和上下文学习作为基线。

Result: 我们的实验在五种语言中评估了模型输出，既自动又手动。手动分析显示，虽然知识蒸馏提高了自动度量分数，但它通过增加有害简化引入了安全权衡。我们发现模型的输出概率是检测有害简化的有用信号。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了高效且安全的LS基准，强调了性能、效率和安全性之间的关键权衡，并展示了安全实际部署的有希望的方法。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 本文建立了评估下一代真正个性化AI研究助手的严格基础。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations
and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential.
However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while
open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect
personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep
Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It
pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user
profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world
contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system
performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures
(P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual
Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current
capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work
establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next
generation of truly personalized AI research assistants.

Method: 本文通过扩展现有的基准测试并评估不同规模的商业和开源大型语言模型来研究知识抽取的价值。

Result: 研究结果显示，网络规模的知识抽取仍然是大型语言模型的挑战性任务，但通过提取三元组和多任务学习可以提高模型效果。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果表明，尽管大型语言模型在问答任务中表现出色，但知识抽取仍然对提高模型效果有帮助。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising
questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question
answering. This paper investigates the value of triple extraction in this new
paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction
annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes.
Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task
for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from
knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and
multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of
knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for
maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource

Method: 通过将任务提示翻译成每种语言，评估了六种开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，并利用AMC-16K数据集进行分析。此外，还使用多语言嵌入模型来研究检索偏见，并分析了检索到的声明的频率。

Result: 研究发现多语言大型语言模型在高资源语言如英语上的表现优于低资源语言。同时，检索偏见导致某些声明被不成比例地检索，从而影响了检索性能的准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言大型语言模型在跨语言事实核查中的持续偏见，并提出了改进多语言事实核查公平性的建议。此外，还发现了检索偏见的存在，某些声明在不同帖子中被不成比例地检索，导致流行声明的检索性能被夸大，而较少常见的声明则被低估。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

TL;DR: PbT是一种两阶段的师生管道，通过生成高质量的合成数据来解决低资源自然语言生成中的配对问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多低资源自然语言生成（NLG）场景中，从业者可能只有原始输出或原始输入，但很少同时拥有两者，这导致小模型只能从很少的例子中学习或依赖于大型LLM生成的昂贵的合成例子。

Method: PbT是一种两阶段的师生管道，通过让教师大语言模型将每个未配对的例子压缩成一个简短的中间表示（IR），然后训练学生从IR中重建输入，从而实现输出与学生生成的输入的配对。

Result: 在五个基准测试（文档摘要、对话摘要和问题生成）以及SwitchBoard的未配对设置中评估了PbT。一个8B的学生仅使用PbT数据就超过了使用70B教师生成语料库和其他无监督基线模型的表现，接近人工标注对的1.2 ROUGE-L，并在三分之一的注释成本下缩小了82%的oracle差距。

Conclusion: PbT能够生成高质量的合成数据，在多个基准测试中表现优异，且在SwitchBoard的人工评估中显示出其生成摘要的简洁性和忠实性。

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用NVFP4格式稳定且准确训练大型语言模型的新方法，通过集成随机哈达玛变换、二维量化方案、随机舍入和选择性高精度层，验证结果显示其性能与FP8基线相当，标志着窄精度LLM训练算法的重大进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进预训练效率对于实现下一代更强大的LLM至关重要。虽然8位浮点（FP8）训练已被广泛采用，但转向更窄的精度，如4位浮点（FP4），可能会提高计算速度和资源利用率。然而，这种级别的量化对训练稳定性、收敛性和实现提出了挑战，尤其是对于在长标记范围上训练的大规模模型。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的方法，使用NVFP4格式稳定且准确地训练大型语言模型（LLMs）。该方法集成了随机哈达玛变换（RHT）以限制块级异常值，采用二维量化方案以在正向和反向传递中保持一致的表示，利用随机舍入进行无偏梯度估计，并包含选择性高精度层。

Result: 我们通过在10万亿个标记上训练一个120亿参数的模型来验证我们的方法——这是迄今为止公开记录的最长的4位精度训练运行。结果表明，使用我们的基于NVFP4的预训练技术训练的模型在训练损失和下游任务准确性方面与FP8基线相当。

Conclusion: NVFP4结合我们的训练方法，在窄精度LLM训练算法方面代表了重大进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Conclusion: NAIPv2 是一种去偏且可扩展的自动化论文质量评估框架，标志着未来科学智能系统的一个重要步骤。

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTS is a framework that improves the factual accuracy and robustness of text summarization by aligning incentives with truthful reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a single response.

Method: Truthful Text Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS decomposes a draft synthesis into atomic claims, elicits each source's stance on every claim, scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that rewards informative agreement, and filters unreliable sources before re-summarizing.

Result: Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and disincentivizing manipulation.

Conclusion: TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and disincentivizing manipulation.

Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage
recipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search
behaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves
reasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\% accuracy
on BrowseComp, 29.2\% on BrowseComp-ZH, and 40.4\% on Xbench-DS, outperforming
prior open-source deep research agents such as WebSailor-72B and DeepDive-32B.

Abstract: Dialect speech embodies rich cultural and linguistic diversity, yet building
text-to-speech (TTS) systems for dialects remains challenging due to scarce
data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation. To address
these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that
standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme
ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a
dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and
employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and
Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches
dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable,
open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive
speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and
specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.

Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and
expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that
isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a
dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal
reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient
cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For
understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder
design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.
For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech
token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice
cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent
work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing
open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,
producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form
audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于缓存标记对注意力输出贡献的简单驱逐标准CAOTE，通过将注意力分数和值向量无缝集成来优化因标记驱逐导致的误差。CAOTE是首个在闭式中使用值标记的基于注意力的驱逐方法，并且可以作为元启发式方法与任何标记驱逐方法灵活结合。实验表明，当与最先进的基于注意力分数的方法结合时，CAOTE总能提高下游任务的准确性，表明在标记驱逐过程中利用值信息的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output.

Method: CAOTE is a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. It optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors.

Result: CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. It improves accuracies on the downstream task when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods.

Conclusion: CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their
abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes
crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely
adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by
evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores
as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of
attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the
information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this
paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of
cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction
error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and
value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of
attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as
a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We
show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based
methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the
importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

*Fumin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模型Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs)，它结合了CESR和GAMs的优点，同时克服了它们的局限性。实验结果表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless, CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs.

Method: We introduce Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.

Result: The experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of predictive performance.

Conclusion: MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of predictive performance.

Motivation: 现有的方法在奖励模型学习中通常依赖于无边界、固定边界或简单的函数边界，但这些方法无法考虑不同偏好强度的差异，且依赖于可能有噪声的边界信息。因此，需要一种更有效的方法来建模偏好强度，以提高泛化能力和对齐效果。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的训练指标（如损失）无法解释大型语言模型中复杂能力的出现。因此，需要一种新的方法来理解模型在不同训练阶段的表示几何变化。

Method: 研究采用了谱方法，通过测量有效秩（RankMe）和特征谱衰减（α-ReQ）来分析预训练和后训练过程中模型表示的几何特性。

Result: 研究发现，在自回归预训练过程中，模型经历了三个几何阶段：初始的“warmup”阶段表现出快速的表示崩溃；随后是“entropy-seeking”阶段，其中流形的维度显著扩展；最后是“compression-seeking”阶段，其中模型选择性地保留主要特征方向上的方差。后训练方法进一步改变了这些几何特性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了在预训练和后训练过程中，大型语言模型的表示几何结构经历了三个非单调的阶段，并展示了这些阶段如何与模型性能和泛化能力相关联。此外，后训练方法对几何结构有进一步影响，这可能对模型的实际应用产生重要影响。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

TL;DR: CE-PO is a reward-shaping framework that enhances the causal coherence of large language models, leading to improved accuracy and robustness to causal perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal perturbations.

Method: CE-PO is a reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). It estimates model-internal influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner.

Result: CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on average (up to 9.58%).

Conclusion: CE-PO improves accuracy and robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits while maintaining near-parity accuracy.

TL;DR: RHYTHM is a unified framework that uses large language models to predict human mobility by leveraging temporal tokenization and hierarchical attention to capture daily and weekly dependencies, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors.

Method: RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies. It also enriches token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeds these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone.

Result: RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time.

Conclusion: RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at

TL;DR: SPEC-RL 是一种基于推测解码的框架，用于提高 RLVR 训练效率，显著减少推演时间而不影响策略质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的加速方法在计算成本、偏差或迭代间的冗余方面存在局限，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案来优化 RLVR 的训练过程。

Method: SPEC-RL 框架结合了推测解码和 RL 推演过程，通过重用之前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，并通过草稿和验证机制扩展它们，从而避免冗余生成并确保策略一致性。

Result: 在多个数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL 将推演时间减少了 2-3 倍，同时不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL 提供了一种通用且实用的方法，以提高大规模推理模型的 RLVR 训练效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

TL;DR: 本文研究了机器学习模型在分布变化下的泛化能力，发现没有一种方法能 consistently 超过使用最新模型参数的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布变化下往往难以保持性能，导致对未来未见过的数据预测不准确。本文旨在研究模型是否能在仅依赖过去数据的情况下实现这种泛化，并在什么条件下可以实现。

Method: 研究探讨了两种主要方法：过去模型参数的凸组合（参数插值）和超出过去参数凸包的显式外推（参数外推）。

Result: 实证结果表明，所评估的方法中没有一种在所有场景中都能持续优于使用最新可用模型参数的简单基线。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据或对底层数据生成过程有稳健假设的情况下，这些结果突显了泛化和外推到未来数据的固有困难，并且在评估此类泛化的声明时需要谨慎。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

TL;DR: 本文研究了MoE模型的扩展定律，识别了五个关键因素，并通过大量实验构建了一个全面的MoE扩展定律，为未来MoE模型的设计和训练提供了指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集模型扩展定律不适用于MoE模型，因为存在三个关键挑战：影响因素的多样性、它们的复杂耦合关系以及性能影响的非单调性。需要对MoE特定的扩展定律进行细致的研究。

Method: 本文对MoE设置进行了系统分解，识别了五个影响模型性能的关键因素，并设计了446个受控实验来表征它们的边际效应，最终构建了一个全面且精确的联合MoE扩展定律。

Result: 结果表明，G和S的最佳设置与模型架构和数据大小无关。随着N的扩展，N_a/N的最佳激活参数比变得更稀疏。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MoE扩展定律可以作为未来MoE模型设计和训练的准确且有见地的指导。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的后训练方法ASFT，通过结合DFT的重新加权和KL正则化，提高了模型的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的后训练方法在监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)之间存在权衡，SFT容易记忆，而RL计算成本高。动态微调(DFT)作为中间方案，在某些推理领域表现良好，但在其他任务中不稳定。因此，需要一种更稳定且有效的后训练方法。

Method: 本文通过奖励加权回归(RWR)框架分析了动态微调(DFT)，并提出了Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT)方法，该方法结合了DFT的重新加权和轻量级KL正则化以确保稳定性。

Result: 实验结果表明，ASFT在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成等多个任务中均优于SFT和DFT，并且具有最小的计算开销。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT)的新方法，通过在动态微调(DFT)的重新加权中加入轻量级KL正则化，实现了更好的稳定性与性能。实验表明，ASFT在多个任务中均优于SFT和DFT，并展示了理论分析对实际应用的积极影响。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型已被广泛研究作为支持知识密集型应用的神经知识库，但其知识的结构组织仍未被探索。受认知神经科学中语义聚类和启动现象的启发，我们研究了LLM中的类似知识同质性模式。

Method: 本文通过在三元组和实体层面进行知识检查，将LLM知识映射到图表示中，并分析实体与其邻居之间的知识能力关系。基于发现的知识同质性模式，提出了一个GNN回归模型来估计实体级别的知识能力分数。

Result: 本文发现LLM倾向于对图中位置较近的实体具有相似的知识水平。基于此同质性原则，提出的GNN回归模型能够估计实体级别的知识能力分数，从而优先检查知识较少的三元组，提高知识覆盖率。

Conclusion: 本文发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在图结构中表现出知识同质性模式，即图中位置相近的实体具有相似的知识水平。基于这一同质性原则，我们提出了一种图神经网络（GNN）回归模型来估计实体级别的知识能力分数，从而提高主动标注的效率并增强多跳路径检索。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了强化学习中探索与利用的权衡观点，提出了一种新的方法VERL，通过利用有效秩及其导数来实现协同的探索-利用增强，并在多个基准上取得了显著成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的观点认为探索和利用之间存在权衡，这种观点主要基于token级别的度量。我们重新审视这一观点，认为这种权衡可能不是基本限制，而是测量层次的产物。

Method: 我们提出了Effective Rank (ER)及其一阶和二阶导数Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)和Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA)，用于量化探索和捕捉利用动态。我们还提出了Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL)方法，利用ERA作为预测性元控制器来创建协同的双通道激励结构。

Result: 我们的分析表明，在隐藏状态层面，探索和利用可以解耦。实验结果表明，VERL方法在多种LLM和推理基准上取得了显著提升，包括在Gaokao 2024数据集上提高了21.4%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了在隐藏状态层面，探索和利用可以解耦，这为同时增强这两种能力提供了机会。我们提出的VERL方法通过直接塑造RL优势函数来实现协同的探索-利用增强，实验结果表明其在多种LLM和推理基准上表现出色。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在各种LLM持续学习基准测试中表现优于之前的方法，有效减少了灾难性遗忘，并为连续LLM微调提供了一个稳健的工具。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 这些结果展示了MUI作为基准性能的补充指标的潜力，为MoE模型的容量、动态和专业化提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Motivation: 现有的Chain-of-Thought（CoT）及其变体由于其单块和自回归架构，导致计算效率低、推理路径探索有限和可解释性差。需要一种更高效的推理框架来解决这些问题。

Method: E^2C框架将推理分为两个阶段：探索阶段随机生成简短的高层计划，执行阶段确定性地执行选定的计划。采用两阶段训练方法，包括监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）阶段。

Result: 在AIME'2024上，E^2C测试时缩放达到了58.1%的准确率，使用的解码标记少于 comparable 方法（如Forest-of-Thought）的10%，显著减少了自我一致性开销。在跨领域适应中，EF-SFT微调仅使用标准SFT 3.5%的标记，但在医学基准测试中比标准SFT高出高达14.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: E^2C框架通过将推理分解为探索和执行阶段，提高了计算效率、推理路径的探索能力以及可解释性。该方法在跨领域适应中表现出色，具有状态领先性能和更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

Conclusion: 本文的研究成果为大型语言模型的离策略强化学习提供了新的见解，并为设计更合理的算法开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) suffer from severe forgetting due to full fine-tuning of a shared base model, leading to knowledge interference between tasks.

Method: LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. It uses a semantic-aware expert selection mechanism and incorporates a contrastive learning objective guided by label descriptions. Additionally, it employs a knowledge distillation strategy to prevent overfitting on the memory buffer.

Result: LEAF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple FCED benchmarks.

Conclusion: LEAF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple FCED benchmarks.

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: OrthAlign introduces a novel approach using orthogonal subspace decomposition to resolve conflicts in multi-objective LLM alignment, resulting in stable and significant improvements across various dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical dilemma in LLM alignment where improvements in one dimension often come at the expense of others, highlighting the need for direct conflict resolution at the parameter level.

Method: OrthAlign leverages orthogonal subspace decomposition to decompose parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring optimization toward different preferences occurs in non-interfering directions.

Result: OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from 34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless, and truthful dimensions, with an average overall reward improvement of 13.96%.

Conclusion: OrthAlign provides a new paradigm for resolving gradient-level conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment, achieving stable convergence and significant improvements in multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

*Sanxing Chen,Xiaoyin Chen,Yukun Huang,Roy Xie,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了通过监督微调和强化学习训练大型语言模型在序列决策中的表现，发现这些方法能够提升性能并实现良好的泛化能力，但也揭示了探索策略的复杂性和潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）有望成为自主代理，但它们在序列决策中往往探索不佳。最近的工作试图通过监督微调（SFT）或强化学习（RL）来增强这一能力，提高了经典多臂老虎机任务上的遗憾度。然而，这些学习方法如何塑造探索策略以及它们的泛化能力仍不清楚。

Method: 我们通过监督微调（SFT）在专家轨迹上训练LLMs，并使用各种定制奖励信号进行强化学习（RL），包括一种战略性的、基于遗憾度的奖励来减少方差，以及一种允许oracle模仿的算法奖励。

Result: 结果表明，这些代理优于预训练模型，并达到了与上限置信度（UCB）和汤普森采样相当的性能，且在6倍更长的时域和跨老虎机家族中具有鲁棒的泛化能力。行为分析显示，收益通常源于更复杂的但更贪婪的利用：RL/SFT代理比预训练模型更容易早期灾难性失败，过早放弃探索。此外，模仿UCB训练的代理学会了通过采用更具利用性的变体来超越其教师。

Conclusion: 我们的研究澄清了在何时每种训练范式更优，并倡导定制的奖励设计和评估，超越平均遗憾度以促进稳健的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

*Shane Bergsma,Bin Claire Zhang,Nolan Dey,Shaheer Muhammad,Gurpreet Gosal,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在最优超参数设置下，不同规模的模型训练损失曲线可以坍缩到同一轨迹，这表明损失曲线坍缩是高效训练的标志。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证损失曲线坍缩现象是否适用于实际的模型扩展方法，以提高训练效率。

Method: 通过分析不同规模下的训练损失曲线，研究了优化超参数对模型训练的影响。

Result: 发现当优化超参数设置为最佳时，损失曲线会精确地坍缩到同一轨迹上。

Conclusion: 损失曲线的坍缩可以作为高效训练的标志，并且在实际的模型扩展中依然成立。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ORPO-Distill, a general-purpose method for cross-architecture
LLM distillation that formulates the problem as a preference optimization task.
Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through
diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization
objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective
learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated
outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on

*Yuxian Jiang,Yafu Li,Guanxu Chen,Dongrui Liu,Yu Cheng,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SIREN, a method that addresses entropy collapse and premature convergence in RLVR for large reasoning models by confining exploration to meaningful actions and states, resulting in improved performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of entropy collapse and premature convergence in RLVR for large reasoning models, which limits their performance and exploration capabilities.

Method: SIREN uses a two-step entropy masking mechanism (top-p mask and peak-entropy mask) and transforms regularization into a self-anchored form to stabilize training.

Result: SIREN achieves superior average performance across five mathematical benchmarks, with a +6.6 maj@k improvement on AIME24/25 using Qwen2.5-Math-7B. It also promotes greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level.

Conclusion: SIREN effectively mitigates the premature convergence problem in RLVR for LRMs by promoting response diversity and maintaining appropriate entropy levels.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们提出了SIRI，一种用于大型推理模型的简单但有效的强化学习方法，通过在训练过程中迭代地在压缩和扩展推理预算之间交替，实现更高效和准确的推理。SIRI在性能和效率之间取得了显著的提升，并在多个任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，大型推理模型中存在重复的思考模式，而试图减少这些模式通常会以性能下降为代价。本文旨在克服这种权衡，通过一种训练制度，迭代地在压缩和扩展推理预算之间交替，从而动态调整最大回溯长度。

Method: 我们提出了SIRI，一种简单的但有效的强化学习方法，用于大型推理模型（LRMs），通过在训练过程中迭代地在压缩和扩展推理预算之间交替，从而实现更高效和准确的推理。压缩阶段减少了回溯长度，迫使模型在有限的上下文中做出精确且有价值的决策，从而有效减少冗余标记并提高推理密度。扩展阶段则放松长度限制，为模型提供空间在长视野设置中进行探索和规划。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上进行训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上的性能提高了43.2%，同时减少了46.9%的标记使用量，经过三次迭代后，SIRI-high在所有其他方法中达到了最高的准确性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了在训练过程中周期性地波动大型推理模型的输出截断长度的潜力，以动态平衡探索和效率，最终达到性能和效率之间的最佳‘甜蜜点’。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MTAM is a framework for testing audio content moderation software by generating adversarial test cases, showing high effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing misuse of audio platforms to disseminate harmful content and the insufficiency of current audio moderation tools against adversarial inputs motivate the development of MTAM.

Method: MTAM is a metamorphic testing framework for audio content moderation software that uses metamorphic relations to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more likely to evade detection.

Result: MTAM achieves high error finding rates when testing commercial and academic audio content moderation software, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: MTAM is effective in testing audio content moderation software and can help improve the robustness of these systems against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp
and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content
in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to
disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive
advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative
consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,
researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio
content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious
actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio
content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the
effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs
remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a
Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.
Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14
metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based
and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic
audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more
likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five
commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against
three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%,
18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing
commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu,
Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when
testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

*Lekang Yang,Yuetong Liu,Yitong Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DiffTester is a framework that accelerates unit test generation using diffusion LLMs by leveraging repetitive structural patterns in tests, achieving significant efficiency gains without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time, leading to inefficient UTG. Diffusion LLMs offer parallel generation capabilities but face a trade-off between efficiency and test quality. The goal is to address this limitation to improve UTG efficiency without sacrificing test quality.

Method: DiffTester is an acceleration framework tailored for diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) in unit test generation (UTG). It identifies repetitive structural patterns in unit tests targeting the same focal method through abstract syntax tree analysis, allowing for adaptive increases in tokens generated per step without compromising quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration while preserving test coverage. It also generalizes well across different dLLMs and programming languages.

Conclusion: DiffTester provides a practical and scalable solution for efficient UTG in software development, showing significant acceleration while preserving test coverage and generalizing well across different dLLMs and programming languages.

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes
the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important.
However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each
forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)
have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing
strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application
to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test
quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often
causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this
limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically
tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests
targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By
dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree
analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of
tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To
enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark,
which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages
including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two
representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration
while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across
different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable
solution for efficient UTG in software development. Code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/wellbeingyang/DLM4UTG-open .

Motivation: 现有的评估器和奖励模型存在局限性，无法全面捕捉视频质量的多维特性，因此需要一种更全面、可解释的评估框架。

Method: VideoScore2采用了一个两阶段的管道，包括监督微调和基于组相对策略优化（GRPO）的强化学习，以提高分析的鲁棒性。

Result: VideoScore2在领域内基准VideoScore-Bench-v2上达到了44.35（+5.94）的准确率，在四个跨领域基准上的平均性能为50.37（+4.32）。

Conclusion: VideoScore2在视频质量评估方面表现出色，能够提供可解释的评估结果，并通过有效的奖励建模促进了可控生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between

Motivation: 现有的方法常常忽视人体骨骼运动的解剖学限制和协调模式，导致生成的结果僵硬或不符合生物力学原理。

Method: 我们提出了一种新方法，通过引入几何约束来显式建模骨骼关节之间的关系，包括肩部、手臂和手部。在训练过程中，我们引入了一种父相对重加权机制以增强手指灵活性并减少运动僵硬性。此外，骨姿态损失和骨长度约束确保了解剖结构的一致性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著提高了手语翻译的解剖真实性和运动自然性，缩小了与理想基准之间的性能差距。

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Conclusion: 通过让Video-LLMs跟踪信念并注册意外，我们的工作为更强大的模型铺平了道路，这些模型能够根据新信息修改其理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoR-SALE is a framework that improves the performance of text-to-image generation models by incorporating a Frame of Reference for better spatial understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of state-of-the-art models exhibiting a significant performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other than the camera.

Method: FoR-SALE evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial expression to a corresponding camera perspective.

Result: FoR-SALE improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% using only a single round of correction.

Conclusion: FoR-SALE improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% using only a single round of correction.

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解模态内依赖关系和模态间依赖关系之间的相互作用对于推进多模态学习至关重要，但目前的基准评估中这些依赖关系的性质和交互仍然不清楚。

Method: 本文进行了一项大规模的实证研究，使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在23个视觉问答基准上量化了这些依赖关系。

Result: 研究发现，对视觉、问题（文本）及其交互的依赖性在不同基准之间以及同一基准内部都有显著差异。许多旨在减轻文本偏见的基准无意中放大了图像依赖性。这种表征在不同大小的模型中都存在，较大的模型通常利用这些模态内依赖性来实现高性能，从而掩盖了多模态推理的不足。

Conclusion: 本文提供了多模态数据集的定量表征，使得多模态基准设计和评估能够采用更系统的方法。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种递归自我反思掩码扩散视觉语言模型（RIV），通过两种新颖机制赋予模型自我纠正能力，实验结果表明RIV在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于掩码扩散的视觉语言模型（MDVLMs）无法纠正生成的标记中的错误，缺乏自我纠正能力。因此，需要一种能够自我纠正的模型来提高性能。

Method: 提出了一种递归自我反思掩码扩散视觉语言模型（RIV），通过两种新颖机制赋予模型自我纠正能力。第一种是自我反思训练，引入了自我反思模型来识别生成序列中的错误。第二种是递归推理，从标准的解掩步骤开始，学习到的自我反思模型有助于识别输出序列中的错误并重新掩码，这个过程反复进行直到获得可靠的结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的RIV在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，优于大多数现有的MDVLMs。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提出的RIV在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，优于大多数现有的MDVLMs。

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了区域理解指数（RCI），这是一种新的评估方法，用于衡量多模态基准测试中对全局与局部视觉信息的依赖程度，并发现大多数现有基准偏向于局部推理，存在空间偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法没有明确测量这种区别，阻碍了有效的数据集整理和面向现实世界的应用模型开发。

Method: 引入了区域理解指数（RCI），这是第一个基于模型的评分，直接量化数据集对全局与局部视觉信息的依赖程度。RCI系统地比较参考模型在图像块与完整图像上的表现，揭示任务是否需要整体图像理解或可以使用部分或局部视觉提示解决。

Result: 当将RCI应用于13个广泛使用的多模态基准时，我们观察到大多数基准偏向于局部推理并表现出显著的空间偏差，这表明在现实应用中存在潜在风险。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员和从业者提供了一个可操作的工具，用于诊断和减轻这些偏差，使构建数据集和基准以促进健壮的、企业就绪的多模态系统的开发成为可能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

*Siyuan Gao,Jiashu Yao,Haoyu Wen,Yuhang Guo,Zeming Liu,Heyan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HomeSafeBench is a new benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in home safety inspection tasks. It addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks by providing dynamic first-person perspective images and allowing agents to freely explore the environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks suffer from two key limitations: they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions instead of direct visual information, and they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and causes the omission of certain safety hazards.

Method: We propose HomeSafeBench, a benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards: fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety inspection.

Result: Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs. The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting effective exploration strategies.

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench will provide valuable reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)，这是第一个系统且可解释的评分，用于量化多模态大语言模型（MLLM）对视觉上下文粒度变化的鲁棒性。通过在19个最先进的MLLM和15个视觉语言基准上应用PCRI，发现大多数领先的模型对背景噪声仍然脆弱，只有少数如InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B表现出一致的鲁棒性。PCRI分析还揭示了不同模型架构如何处理和整合视觉上下文，为研究人员和实践者提供了可操作的诊断见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics.

Method: We introduce the Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI), the first systematic and interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input.

Result: Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.

Conclusion: PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMS is a framework that improves GUI grounding performance by combining general vision-language models and task-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation.

Method: GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by assigning them distinct roles within the framework.

Result: Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only 2.0% and 3.7% accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of 35.7%, representing a 10 times improvement.

Conclusion: GMS significantly outperforms other strong baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR)范式，使自回归推理直接在视觉嵌入空间中进行，从而提升了视觉理解和感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法仍然受到限制：推理仍局限于语言空间，视觉信息被视为静态前提。为了克服这一限制，引入LVR来实现直接在视觉嵌入空间中的推理。

Method: 提出了一种新的范式Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR)，通过将图像投影到与语言模型共享的联合语义空间中的视觉标记，使自回归推理直接在视觉嵌入空间中进行。此外，还适应了GRPO算法进行强化学习，以平衡LVR和文本生成。

Result: 通过将LVR与标准文本生成交错，模型在感知密集型的视觉问答任务中取得了显著提升。LVR显著提高了细粒度的视觉理解和感知能力，在MMVP上达到了71.67%的准确率。

Conclusion: LVR显著提高了细粒度的视觉理解和感知能力，在MMVP上达到了71.67%的准确率，优于Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间智能是多模态大语言模型仍面临的关键未解挑战，因此需要一种有效的手段来提升模型的空间推理能力。

Method: 本文将欧几里得几何问题解决作为替代任务，构建了一个名为Euclid30K的多模态数据集，并使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 对Qwen2.5VL和RoboBrain2.0系列模型进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，经过微调的模型在四个空间推理基准测试中实现了显著的零样本提升，其中RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B在VSI-Bench上的准确率达到了49.6%，超过了之前最先进的模型。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统地展示了以几何为中心的微调可以赋予视觉-语言模型广泛可转移的空间技能。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and

Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MMRQA框架，该框架通过整合多模态大语言模型和采集感知信号处理，解决了MRI质量评估中的挑战，实现了先进的性能和临床可解释的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磁共振成像（MRI）质量评估对于临床决策至关重要，但由于数据稀缺性和协议变异性而仍然具有挑战性。传统方法面临根本性的权衡：基于信号的方法如MRIQC提供定量指标但缺乏语义理解，而深度学习方法虽然实现高准确性但牺牲了可解释性。

Method: MMRQA框架结合了三种关键创新：通过MRQy增强的鲁棒指标提取，使用Qwen将指标结构化为问答对，以及通过LLaVA-OneVision的低秩适应（LoRA）进行参数高效的融合。

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中，MMRQA实现了最先进的性能，并具有强大的零样本泛化能力，这通过全面的消融研究得到了验证。

Conclusion: 通过将定量分析与语义推理相结合，我们的框架生成了临床可解释的输出，增强了动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出TemMed-Bench基准，用于评估LVLMs在分析患者病情变化方面的表现，并发现多模态检索增强方法能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学推理基准主要关注单次就诊的图像分析，而现实临床实践中医生通常需要参考患者的病史来综合评估病情变化。因此，需要一个能够分析患者病情变化的基准。

Method: 本文引入了TemMed-Bench基准，包含三个任务（视觉问答、报告生成和图像对选择）以及一个包含17,000个实例的补充知识语料库，并评估了12种LVLMs的表现。此外，还探索了在输入中加入检索到的视觉和文本模态的方法。

Result: 大多数LVLMs在处理时间医学图像时表现不佳，仅能随机猜测。GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现出较好的性能，但仍未达到理想水平。多模态检索增强方法在大多数模型上显著提升了性能，特别是在VQA任务中平均提高了2.59%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于现实临床实践的基准TemMed-Bench，用于分析患者在不同临床访问中的病情变化。结果表明，大多数LVLMs在处理时间医学图像时存在局限性，而多模态检索增强方法显示出较高的性能提升。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

TL;DR: GSM8K-V is a new visual multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark that highlights the limitations of current VLMs and offers a path for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in existing visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks, which are often restricted to geometry and lack coverage of math word problems and multi-image reasoning.

Method: GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the text-based GSM8K into visual form through an automated image-generation pipeline combined with human annotation.

Result: Existing VLMs have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, but there remains substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V.

Conclusion: GSM8K-V provides a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and generalizable VLMs.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

Abstract: We present an overview of the SCIDOCA 2025 Shared Task, which focuses on
citation discovery and prediction in scientific documents. The task is divided
into three subtasks: (1) Citation Discovery, where systems must identify
relevant references for a given paragraph; (2) Masked Citation Prediction,
which requires selecting the correct citation for masked citation slots; and
(3) Citation Sentence Prediction, where systems must determine the correct
reference for each cited sentence. We release a large-scale dataset constructed
from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC), containing over 60,000
annotated paragraphs and a curated reference set. The test set consists of
1,000 paragraphs from distinct papers, each annotated with ground-truth
citations and distractor candidates. A total of seven teams registered, with
three submitting results. We report performance metrics across all subtasks and
analyze the effectiveness of submitted systems. This shared task provides a new
benchmark for evaluating citation modeling and encourages future research in

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT数据集和KRONOS框架，以解决在患者特异性蛋白质组学中进行多模态语言建模的挑战，并展示了其在临床任务中的良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏指导调优数据集以及没有设计用于捕捉分子数据丰富异质性的语言模型架构，因此在患者特异性蛋白质组学的多模态语言建模方面仍然存在重大挑战。

Method: 引入了CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT，这是第一个用于肿瘤学分子理解的指令调优数据集，并提出了KRONOS（通过结构化调优在肿瘤学中对患者组学网络进行知识表示），这是一种新型的图-LLM框架。

Result: KRONOS在基准临床任务中表现出色，包括分子分类、时间轨迹建模和从蛋白质组学数据中预测肿瘤阶段。

Conclusion: 该方法使LLMs能够理解患者水平的病理发生，通过更准确的诊断、预后和治疗分层来推动精准医学。

Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease
phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision
medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive
individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical
heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data
modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular
understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge
due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable
clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language
modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular
data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning
dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k
open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from
the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose
KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via
Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular
interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph
representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves
competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular
classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from
proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand
patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

TL;DR: 本文提出PARROT，一个用于跨系统SQL翻译的实用且现实的基准测试，旨在填补现有研究的空白并推动未来的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SQL基准测试不适合评估SQL-to-SQL任务，因为它们仅关注有限的数据库系统，并且无法捕捉许多系统特定的SQL方言。因此，需要一个新的基准来解决这些问题。

Method: 本文介绍了PARROT，一个用于跨系统SQL翻译的基准测试，包含从38个开源基准和实际业务服务中提取的598个翻译对，并提供了多个变体以覆盖不同的测试需求。

Result: PARROT包含了多种变体，如PARROT-Diverse和PARROT-Simple，涵盖了22个生产级数据库系统，LLMS在其中的平均准确率低于38.53%。

Conclusion: PARROT是一个实用且现实的跨系统SQL翻译基准，旨在促进未来的研究，并通过公开的排行榜和源代码支持研究者进行进一步探索。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in
Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL
Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database
system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g.,
ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored.
Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which
(1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2)
cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions,
data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a
Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT
comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world
business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL
understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We
also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003
translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306
representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22
production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MAS$^2$，这是一种基于递归自我生成原则的多智能体系统，能够在动态任务需求下动态组合和自适应修正目标代理系统。在多个基准测试中，MAS$^2$表现出色，并且在成本和性能之间保持了良好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动多智能体系统大多遵循“生成一次并部署”的刚性模式，这使得系统在现实环境的动态性和不确定性面前显得脆弱。

Method: 提出了一个由生成器-实现者-修正者组成的三代理团队，以动态组合和自适应修正目标代理系统。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，MAS$^2$在复杂场景如深度研究和代码生成中比最先进的多智能体系统提高了高达19.6%的性能。此外，MAS$^2$在跨基础模型的泛化能力上表现优异，能够有效利用之前未见过的大型语言模型，提高高达15.1%。

Conclusion: MAS$^2$在复杂场景中表现出色，同时在成本和性能之间保持了良好的平衡。

Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model
(LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence
and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has
rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke
configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward
frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic
multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM
agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''
paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the
dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this
limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of
recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects
bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a
``\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of
dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in
response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed
to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven
benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\%$
over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code
generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,
effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to
$15.1\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token
costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of
cost-performance trade-offs. The source codes are available at

*Changde Du,Yizhuo Lu,Zhongyu Huang,Yi Sun,Zisen Zhou,Shaozheng Qin,Huiguang He*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了情感表示在人类认知和社会互动中的重要性，并测试了大规模相似性判断是否能更忠实地捕捉大脑的情感几何形状。研究发现，MLLM可以自主发展出丰富且与神经相关的感情表示，为弥合主观体验与其神经基础之间的差距提供了一个强有力的范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们假设这个差距是由于传统评分量表的限制，并且大规模的相似性判断可以更忠实地捕捉大脑的情感几何形状。

Method: 我们使用AI模型作为“认知代理”，收集了来自多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和仅语言模型（LLM）的数百万个三元组奇数判断，以响应2,180个情感引发视频。

Result: 从这些模型中出现的30维嵌入高度可解释，并主要沿分类线组织情感，但以混合的方式结合了维度属性。最显著的是，MLLM的表示预测了人类情感处理网络中的神经活动，准确性最高，超过了LLM，甚至出乎意料地超过了直接从人类行为评分中得出的表示。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，MLLM可以自主发展出丰富且与神经相关的感情表示，为弥合主观体验与其神经基础之间的差距提供了一个强有力的范式。

Abstract: The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition
and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective
space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the
`behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict
brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the
constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity
judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI
models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out
judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only
model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that
the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly
interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a
blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the
MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing
networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also,
counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral
ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory
grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly
neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide
compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned
affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap
between subjective experience and its neural substrates. Project page:

Motivation: 研究文本特征在财报新闻稿中如何预测财报公布日的股票收益。

Method: 我们比较了传统的词袋模型和基于BERT的嵌入方法，利用2005年至2023年超过138,000份财报新闻稿进行分析。

Result: 我们发现财报新闻稿内容（软信息）与收益意外（硬信息）一样具有信息量，FinBERT表现出最高的预测能力。结合模型增强了对新闻稿内容的解释力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 我们的框架支持通过在线学习集成进行实时回报预测，提供可解释性并揭示语言在价格形成中的细微作用。

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock
returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from
2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We
find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as
earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest
predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and
interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect
the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it
offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in
managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction
through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and
reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出VSSFlow，将视频到声音和视觉文本到语音任务整合到一个统一的流匹配框架中，通过条件聚合机制和端到端的联合学习过程，实现了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频条件的声音和语音生成任务通常被单独处理，缺乏在一个框架中统一它们的探索。最近尝试统一V2S和VisualTTS面临处理不同条件类型（例如异构视频和转录条件）和需要复杂训练阶段的挑战。统一这两个任务仍然是一个开放问题。

Method: VSSFlow使用了一种新颖的条件聚合机制，利用交叉注意力和自注意力层的不同归纳偏差来处理不同的表示：交叉注意力用于模糊的视频条件，自注意力用于更确定的语音转录本。此外，VSSFlow通过端到端的联合学习过程进行声音和语音生成，无需额外的训练阶段设计。

Result: VSSFlow在V2S和VisualTTS基准测试中均优于最先进的领域特定基线，证明了统一生成模型的关键潜力。

Conclusion: VSSFlow在视频到声音和视觉文本到语音任务上超越了最先进的领域特定基线，证明了统一生成模型的关键潜力。

Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound
(V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed
as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle
framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in
handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript
conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks
remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which
seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching
framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle
distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer
exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition.
Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle
different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and
self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary
to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex
training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits
from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation
without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to
the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates
convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the
classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S
and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified
generative models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合GTO防御强度和实时剥削的模型，以在无限注德州扑克中最大化利润。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏理论最优（GTO）提供了避免损失的策略，但纯GTO并不能保证最大利润。因此，我们旨在开发一种优于GTO策略的模型，以在无限注德州扑克中最大化利润。

Method: 模型首先通过模拟许多扑克牌局来寻找GTO基础，并不断调整决策，直到没有行动能可靠地击败它，从而创建一个接近理论最佳策略的强基线。然后，它通过观察对手行为并相应调整策略来捕捉额外价值。

Result: 结果表明，在一对一情况下，蒙特卡洛反事实遗憾最小化（CFR）表现最佳，而在大多数多玩家情况下，CFR仍然是最强的方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合GTO的防御强度和实时剥削，我们的方法旨在展示扑克代理如何从仅仅不输转变为在面对多样对手时持续获胜。

Abstract: Game theory has grown into a major field over the past few decades, and poker
has long served as one of its key case studies. Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO)
provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee
maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO
strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and
multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation
and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many
simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no
action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the
theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and
adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate
that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in
heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way
situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time
exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely
not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决当前缺乏明确原则来判断一个模型实例的研究结果是否能推广到其他模型的问题。

Method: 论文提出了五个可能的对应轴，用于判断机械性声明是否可以推广，并通过分析Pythia模型中的“1-back attention heads”来验证该框架。

Result: 研究发现，在不同模型中，“1-back attention heads”的发展轨迹表现出显著的一致性，而位置一致性则较为有限。此外，较大模型的种子显示出更早的开始时间、更陡峭的斜率和更高的峰值。

Conclusion: 论文认为，机械解释可解释性研究的可推广性进展将体现在将LLM的基本设计属性映射到其出现的行为和机制上。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一种几何项目反应框架，用于评估LLM的能力，并揭示问题结构与模型能力之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM评估实践将多样化的技能压缩成单一分数，掩盖了其本质上多维的性质。需要一种能够揭示LLM能力与问题结构之间关系的方法。

Method: JE-IRT是一种几何项目反应框架，它将LLM和问题嵌入到一个共享空间中。问题嵌入的方向编码语义，范数编码难度，而每个问题的正确性由模型和问题嵌入之间的几何相互作用决定。

Result: 实验结果表明，分布外行为可以通过方向对齐来解释，更大的范数始终表示更难的问题。此外，JE-IRT自然支持泛化：一旦空间被学习，新LLM通过拟合单个嵌入来添加。学习的空间进一步揭示了一个部分与人类定义的主题类别对齐的LLM内部分类法。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了一个统一且可解释的几何视角，将LLM的能力与问题结构联系起来，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特的视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade is an online and interactive LLM Cascade that improves the efficiency of model cascading by allowing the strong model to act as a long-term teacher, thereby reducing the need for expensive model calls while improving the performance of the weak model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LLM Cascade approach is nonadaptive and may repeatedly consult the expensive model for similar or repeated queries, incurring higher cost. To improve the cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade.

Method: Inter-Cascade is an online and interactive LLM Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a long-term teacher. When a strong model resolves a difficult query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.

Result: Compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models (by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up to 49.63% relative reduction).

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的SWE LLM Kimi-Dev，它在SWE-bench Verified上取得了60.4%的成绩，并且通过额外的SFT适应，使SWE-Agents达到了48.6%的pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。结果表明，从无代理训练中获得的结构化技能先验可以桥接工作流和代理框架，以实现可转移的编码代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们认为这些范式并不是互斥的：推理密集型的无代理训练会引发技能先验，包括定位、代码编辑和自我反思，这使得高效的和有效的SWE代理适应成为可能。

Method: 我们首先整理了无代理训练配方，并提出了Kimi-Dev，一个开源的SWE LLM，在SWE-bench Verified上达到了60.4%，是工作流方法中的最佳表现。通过在5k个公开可用轨迹上的额外SFT适应，Kimi-Dev使SWE-Agents达到48.6%的pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到了60.4%，是工作流方法中的最佳表现。通过在5k个公开可用轨迹上的额外SFT适应，Kimi-Dev使SWE-Agents达到48.6%的pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。

Conclusion: 结构化的技能先验可以从无代理训练中桥接工作流和代理框架，以实现可转移的编码代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多玩家纳什偏好优化框架（MNPO），用于对齐大型语言模型与复杂的、非传递的人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 RLHF 方法在处理现实世界中非传递和异质性偏好时存在局限性，而 NLHF 方法仅限于两人互动，无法捕捉真实偏好结构的复杂性。

Method: MNPO 将对齐问题重新表述为一个 n-玩家博弈，其中每个策略与一组对手竞争，同时被正则化到一个参考模型。

Result: MNPO 在指令遵循基准测试中表现优于现有的 NLHF 基线，在异质标注者条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO 是一种原则性和可扩展的框架，可以对齐大型语言模型与复杂的、非传递的人类偏好。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

*Runyan Tan,Shuang Wu,Phillip Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的采样方法 $p$-less sampling，该方法无需超参数，能够保持高质量输出并提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的采样方法对超参数的选择非常敏感，而这些参数可能需要根据生成任务和温度配置进行调整。因此，需要一种不需要超参数且能保持高质量输出的方法。

Method: $p$-less sampling 是一种基于信息论的采样方法，它在每个解码步骤中动态设置截断阈值，基于整个标记概率分布，无需超参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，$p$-less sampling 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作等多种任务中 consistently 超过现有方法，并且在高温值下文本质量下降较少。此外，$p$-less sampling 在推理时间效率上也优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的采样方法 $p$-less sampling，该方法在不同温度配置下都能保持高质量的输出，并且在推理时间效率和文本质量方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

*Ningning Xu,Yuxuan Jiang,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模式感知的工具集成推理方法，通过两阶段框架提升代码使用率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究主要研究何时调用工具，而忽视了如何应用工具。我们识别出两种常见模式：计算器模式和算法模式。不匹配的选择即使在推理正确时也会导致失败。

Method: 我们提出了一种两阶段框架，首先从两种模式中构建代码能力，然后将模式选择与教师偏好对齐。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上，我们的模式感知方法显著提高了代码使用率和准确性，例如将MATH500上的Code@1从64.0%提高到70.5%，将AIME24上的Code@1从26.7%提高到50.0%。

Conclusion: 这些成果突显了模式感知方法在工具集成推理中的有效性。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: JET is a method that improves reasoning efficiency by terminating unnecessary steps, achieving better performance with shorter reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to construct short reasoning paths during the rollout stage, limiting effective learning. LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in reasoning, making further steps redundant.

Method: JET trains models to proactively terminate unnecessary reasoning, performs trajectory truncation during rollout, and uses a quality-controlled length reward to encourage concise reasoning while maintaining correctness.

Result: JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6% accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

Conclusion: JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）基准测试的签名方法，用于分析模型在不同任务中的表现和重叠情况。研究发现，基准签名能够有效捕捉模型能力的变化和差异，揭示了模型在不同领域的交叉功能重叠情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更准确地评估大型语言模型（LLM）基准测试的有效性，并理解其性能重叠和差异，我们需要一种能够捕捉模型能力的签名方法。

Method: 我们通过逐步前向选择与线性回归，在32个大型语言模型和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，以分析其在不同知识、编码、逻辑、指令遵循、数学、语言、推理和世界建模领域的表现。

Result: 我们的分析显示，基准签名能够有效捕捉变化、重叠和分歧，特别是在逻辑、数学、语言、指令遵循和世界建模方面存在跨功能重叠，而编码领域则最少重叠。此外，性能结果受到基准无关因素的影响，如问题格式，这表明当前主流基准测试研究存在局限性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了对基准有效性及大型语言模型敏感性的机制洞察，并描绘了相互关联的大型语言模型能力的底层格局。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: 该基准为通过更好的数据质量改进LLM对齐奠定了基础，强调了数据预处理在负责任的AI开发中的关键但未被充分探索的作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Conclusion: 这些发现加深了我们对大型推理模型如何利用推理标记进行答案生成的理解，强调了中间推理在塑造模型输出中的功能作用。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Motivation: 由于不可靠的搜索结果可能对终端用户构成安全威胁，因此需要一种系统、可扩展且成本效益高的方法来评估搜索代理的安全性。

Method: 我们引入了一个自动化红队框架，用于对搜索代理进行轻量级和无害的安全评估，并构建了SafeSearch基准测试。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在促进更安全的代理开发方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

Motivation: Existing methods for chemical reaction recommendation rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions, limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows.

Method: ChemMAS is a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an evidence-based reasoning task, decomposing the task into mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation.

Result: Experiments show that ChemMAS achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: ChemMAS establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery by providing falsifiable, human-trustable rationales.

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CANON的新方法，用于增强大型语言模型的推理能力。该方法通过重新分组样本响应并比较不同组的表现来提高目标度量的影响，而无需假设其方向。实验结果表明，CANON在多个大型语言模型上均优于现有方法，并在响应长度方面提高了令牌效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased and may lead to failure.

Method: We introduce Conditional advANtage estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group.

Result: CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Conclusion: CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Motivation: LLM排行榜通常依赖于单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能得出可靠结论尚不清楚。

Method: 通过混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定分析和运行间可靠性评估了额外重复的价值。

Result: 单次运行的排行榜容易出现排名反转，两次运行可以消除约83%的单次运行反转。

Conclusion: 单次运行的排行榜是脆弱的，建议使用至少两次重复以提高模型比较的稳健性。

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型在解决复杂问题时，其最终答案可能与其推理过程不一致。这源于两种竞争机制：链式思维推理和记忆检索。通过实验，研究者发现这两种机制同时存在，但其主导程度受多种因素影响。为了解决这一问题，研究者提出了一种新的微调框架FARL，通过抑制检索捷径来促进以推理为主的行为，从而增强模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在通过链式思维（CoT）推理解决复杂问题方面表现出前所未有的能力。然而，最近的研究表明，它们的最终答案经常与其自身的推理轨迹相矛盾。我们假设这种不一致源于生成答案的两种竞争机制：CoT推理和记忆检索。

Method: 我们进行了受控实验，通过在推理过程中引入误导性线索和/或在检索过程中引入损坏的答案来挑战LRMs。

Result: 我们的结果在不同模型和数据集上确认了这两种机制同时运作，其相对主导程度受到多种因素的影响：问题领域、模型规模和微调方法（例如，强化学习与蒸馏）。

Conclusion: 研究发现当前的推理微调范式存在关键限制，模型可以利用检索机制作为捷径，从而“破解”奖励信号并削弱真正的推理发展。为了解决这一挑战，我们引入了FARL，一种结合记忆遗忘和强化学习的新颖微调框架，通过在微调过程中仔细抑制检索捷径，促进以推理为主的行为，并增强可推广的推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: FR-Ponder 通过实例自适应的计算分配提高了 LLM 的推理性能，无需修改骨干权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时计算方法在简单查询上浪费计算资源，而在复杂查询上可能不够深入。

Method: FR-Ponder 是一种无需骨干训练的单图框架，通过潜在引导来分配实例自适应的推理计算。

Result: FR-Ponder 在 GSM8K 和 MATH500 数据集上取得了更好的计算-准确性平衡，并且与早期退出基线相比表现更好。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder 提高了计算-准确性前沿，通过更智能的计算分配实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SpecExit的新框架，通过从轻量级草稿模型中预测未来标记和早期退出信号，以解决大型推理模型的过度思考问题，从而显著减少生成长度并提高端到端延迟效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型在推理任务中表现出色，但它们常常存在过度思考的问题，导致输出过长和端到端延迟高，这限制了它们在现实世界中的部署。为了应对过度思考，已经提出了早期退出机制，在典型完成前终止推理，这种方法可以有效缩短生成长度且对准确性影响最小。然而，它们依赖于探测机制，这引入了检测开销，限制了端到端延迟的增益，并损害了在多样化问题上的泛化能力。

Method: 我们提出了SpecExit框架，该框架直接从轻量级草稿模型中预测未来标记和早期退出信号，而无需探测开销。

Result: 我们的方法显著提高了性能，与推测解码基线相比，平均生成长度减少了66%，端到端延迟提高了2.5倍，同时没有牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法利用了隐藏状态中的内在信号来提供有效的早期退出信号，表明隐藏状态在高效推理中的更广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 我们的工作为构建更稳健和可靠的推理模型指明了新方向。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified

SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法忽视了安全推理的独特重要性，这可能在应用中带来潜在风险，因此需要关注推理本身的安全性。

Method: 本文提出了Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过替换合规步骤中的安全触发器并构建具有强信号的偏好学习对来强制安全推理。

Result: 实验表明，IPO在防止有害内容方面显著优于基于SFT和RL的基线方法，有害性减少了30%以上，同时保持了在各种推理任务中的优秀性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了对推理进行显式对齐的重要性，并为更安全的大型推理模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Conclusion: EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种边界感知策略，使大型推理模型能够在不牺牲准确性的情况下避免无用的推理，显著提高了可靠性并减少了token使用量。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Conclusion: 优先考虑数据中的推理复杂性而不是单纯的数据规模或表面形式对于实现大语言模型的全部认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探讨RL是否能教会LLM真正的新技能，而不是仅仅激活已有的技能。这是关于RL在LLM后训练中的作用的持续争论的核心问题。

Method: 本文开发了一个合成框架来研究LLM在RL过程中是否能获得新技能。具体来说，定义了一个技能为根据输入x推断字符串转换函数f(x)的输出的能力。实验表明，当LLM已经学习了f和g后，RL使其能够学习未见过的组合h(x)=g(f(x))。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在RL过程中可以学习到新的组合技能，并且这些技能可以转移到不同的任务上。此外，RL改变了模型的推理行为，而使用相同数据的下一个token训练则没有这些发现。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，RL可以真正教会LLM新技能，而不仅仅是激活已有的技能。通过组合已有的技能，LLM可以在RL过程中获得新的技能，这种能力类似于人类学习新认知技能的方式。此外，这种组合能力可以转移到不同的任务上，即使没有在目标任务上进行组合训练。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从自然人类互动中学习的强化学习方法，能够有效提升模型的个性化和指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的对话模型使用预标注、专家生成的人类反馈进行对齐，但未来模型需要从自然的人类互动中学习以实现持续改进和多方面对齐。

Method: 引入了从人类互动中进行强化学习（RLHI），包括两种互补的方法：(1) 用户引导重写，根据用户的自然语言后续响应修改不满意的模型输出；(2) 基于用户奖励的方法，通过基于用户长期互动历史（称为人格）的奖励模型进行学习。

Result: 在WildChat数据集上训练的RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面优于强基线，并且类似的反馈提高了推理基准的表现。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，有机的人类互动为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ReasoningBank的新记忆框架，可以从代理的自我判断的成功和失败经验中提炼出可推广的推理策略。此外，还引入了记忆感知的测试时缩放（MaTTS），通过扩大代理的交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程。实验结果表明，ReasoningBank在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并且MaTTS进一步提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型代理在持久的现实世界角色中的采用不断增加，它们自然会遇到持续的任务流。然而，一个关键限制是它们无法从积累的交互历史中学习，迫使它们丢弃有价值的见解并重复过去的错误。

Method: 我们提出了ReasoningBank，这是一种新颖的记忆框架，可以从代理的自我判断的成功和失败经验中提炼出可推广的推理策略。此外，我们引入了记忆感知的测试时缩放（MaTTS），通过扩大代理的交互经验来加速和多样化这个学习过程。

Result: 在网页浏览和软件工程基准测试中，ReasoningBank始终优于现有的存储原始轨迹或仅存储成功任务流程的记忆机制，提高了有效性和效率；MaTTS进一步放大了这些收益。

Conclusion: 这些发现确立了以记忆驱动的经验扩展作为新的扩展维度，使代理能够通过自然出现的行为自我进化。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: 本文研究了合成数据在大型语言模型训练中的安全性，提出了一种新的攻击框架VIA，能够通过合成数据传播攻击，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管合成数据已被广泛用于大型语言模型的开发，但其可能引入的安全风险尚未被深入研究。因此，本文旨在系统评估合成数据集成训练范式的安全性，并探索潜在的安全风险。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的通用攻击框架Virus Infection Attack (VIA)，该框架受到网络安全中病毒设计原理的启发，能够在良性样本中寻找最佳劫持点，以最大化生成恶意内容的可能性。

Result: 实验结果表明，VIA显著增加了合成数据中中毒内容的存在，并相应地将下游模型的攻击成功率提高到与中毒上游模型相当的水平。

Conclusion: 本文系统评估了合成数据集成训练范式对主流中毒和后门攻击的鲁棒性，并揭示了该范式对现有攻击具有较强的抵抗力。此外，本文提出了Virus Infection Attack (VIA)攻击框架，能够通过合成数据传播当前攻击，从而进一步研究合成数据引入的安全风险。

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has
been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language
models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development,
potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper
systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training
paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal
that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily
thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and
queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of
these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by
synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely,
Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks
through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the
principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload
within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking
points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious
content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show
that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic
data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream
models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

TL;DR: MaskSQL是一种文本到SQL框架，通过抽象机制在保护隐私的同时保持性能，适用于更广泛的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM由于隐私问题和高昂的成本，难以在敏感系统中使用；而微调的小语言模型（SLM）在复杂任务上表现不佳。因此需要一种既能保护隐私又能保持性能的方法。

Method: MaskSQL利用抽象作为隐私保护机制，通过保留关键信息并丢弃不必要的细节，实现了文本到SQL任务的隐私-效用平衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，MaskSQL优于基于SLM的文本到SQL模型，并且在保持隐私的前提下接近最先进的LLM模型的性能。

Conclusion: MaskSQL能够实现隐私保护的同时，达到接近最先进的LLM模型的性能，从而在更广泛的应用场景中得到采用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that
require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging.
However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their
integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary,
costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical.
Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party
providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations.
Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain
tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform
on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we
introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a
privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts.
Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which
broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding
unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the
text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the
privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range
of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading
SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching
state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用微调的大型语言模型（LLMs）来处理调查中的缺失数据问题，特别是在数据完全随机缺失和只有有偏便利样本可用的情况下。结果表明，微调的LLMs在某些情况下比传统的表格分类器表现更好，为研究人员提供了一种有前景的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查研究人员面临两个关键挑战：概率样本的日益增长的成本和缺失数据（例如，无响应或流失），这会损害推断并增加便利样本的使用。最近的工作探索使用大型语言模型（LLMs）通过基于人物的提示来模拟受访者，通常没有标记数据。

Method: 我们研究了一个更实际的场景，其中存在部分调查回答：我们在可用数据上对LLM进行微调，以在随机和系统性无响应的情况下推断自我报告的投票选择，使用德国纵向选举研究。我们比较了零样本提示和监督微调与表格分类器（如CatBoost），并测试了用于微调的不同便利样本（如学生）对泛化的影响。

Result: 当数据完全随机缺失时，微调的LLM与表格分类器相当，但优于零样本方法。当只有有偏的便利样本可用时，微调小型（3B到8B）开源LLM可以比零样本方法更准确地恢复个体层面的预测和总体层面的分布，有时甚至优于表格方法。

Conclusion: 当数据完全随机缺失时，微调的LLM与表格分类器相当，但优于零样本方法。当只有有偏的便利样本可用时，微调小型（3B到8B）开源LLM可以比零样本方法更准确地恢复个体层面的预测和总体层面的分布，有时甚至优于表格方法。这表明微调的LLM为处理非概率样本或系统性缺失的研究人员提供了一个有前景的策略，并可能启用只需要易于获取子种群的新调查设计。

Abstract: Survey researchers face two key challenges: the rising costs of probability
samples and missing data (e.g., non-response or attrition), which can undermine
inference and increase the use of convenience samples. Recent work explores
using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based
prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where
partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute
self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using
the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and
supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test
how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect
generalization.
  Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned
LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only
biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B)
open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and
population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better
than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy
for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness,
and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible
subpopulations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的训练框架Masked History Learning (MHL)，通过重建被屏蔽的历史项目来提升生成推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成推荐方法依赖于纯粹的自回归训练，仅关注预测下一个项目，而忽略了用户交互历史的丰富内部结构，导致无法掌握潜在意图。

Method: 提出了一种新的训练框架Masked History Learning (MHL)，通过辅助任务重建被屏蔽的历史项目，使模型深入理解用户行为的形成原因。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，所提出的方法显著优于最先进的生成模型。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，对过去的全面理解对于准确预测用户的未来路径至关重要。

Abstract: Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has
emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its
potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive
training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while
ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus
failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose
Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the
objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history.
MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of
reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand
``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just
``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this
framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the
most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum
learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction
to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that
a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting
a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Retro*是一种用于推理密集型文档检索的新方法，通过基于标准的相关性评分机制和强化学习算法，提高了文档检索的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理和RAG的流行，检索对解决问题至关重要的文档变得越来越重要，即使它们与任务的联系是间接或隐含的。现有的IR技术难以处理这种细粒度的推理。

Method: Retro*引入了一种基于标准的相关性评分机制，使模型能够根据明确定义的标准来推理任务与文档之间的关系，并通过得分集成支持测试时的扩展。此外，还引入了一种针对其相关性评分机制的新型强化学习算法。

Result: 实验表明，Retro*在现有文档检索方法中表现优异，具有显著优势，并在BRIGHT基准测试中达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Retro*在BRIGHT基准测试中表现出色，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly
important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even
when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this
problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance
between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a
significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in
reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a
novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method
introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to
reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly
defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance
score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning
trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance
estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism,
which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each
training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document
retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art
performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.
