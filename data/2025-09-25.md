### [1] [Automated Item Neutralization for Non-Cognitive Scales: A Large Language Model Approach to Reducing Social-Desirability Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19314)
*Sirui Wu,Daijin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了由大型语言模型（LLM）辅助的项目中和，以减少个性评估中的社会期望偏差。结果显示，AI中和是一种潜在但不完美的偏见减少方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少个性评估中的社会期望偏差。

Method: 使用GPT-o3重写国际人格项目库大五测量（IPIP-BFM-50）以评估项目中和辅助大型语言模型（LLM）以减少个性评估中的社会期望偏差。

Result: 保留了信度和五因素结构，尽管理想和开放性有所下降，而尽职性有所提高。一些项目的社会期望相关性降低，但不一致。配置不变性成立，但度量和标度不变性失败。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持AI中和作为一种潜在但不完美的偏见减少方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates item neutralization assisted by the large language model
(LLM) to reduce social desirability bias in personality assessment. GPT-o3 was
used to rewrite the International Personality Item Pool Big Five Measure
(IPIP-BFM-50), and 203 participants completed either the original or
neutralized form along with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. The
results showed preserved reliability and a five-factor structure, with gains in
Conscientiousness and declines in Agreeableness and Openness. The correlations
with social desirability decreased for several items, but inconsistently.
Configural invariance held, though metric and scalar invariance failed.
Findings support AI neutralization as a potential but imperfect bias-reduction
method.

### [2] [FHIR-AgentBench: Benchmarking LLM Agents for Realistic Interoperable EHR Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19319)
*Gyubok Lee,Elea Bach,Eric Yang,Tom Pollard,Alistair Johnson,Edward Choi,Yugang jia,Jong Ha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了FHIR-AgentBench，一个将2,931个真实临床问题与HL7 FHIR标准相结合的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在互操作临床数据上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试未能跟上向HL7 FHIR标准的转变，缺乏评估最近LLM在互操作临床数据上的现实性。

Method: 我们引入了FHIR-AgentBench，这是一个将2,931个真实临床问题与HL7 FHIR标准相结合的基准测试。使用这个基准测试，我们系统地评估了代理框架，比较了不同的数据检索策略（直接FHIR API调用与专用工具）、交互模式（单次轮换与多次轮换）以及推理策略（自然语言与代码生成）。

Result: 我们的实验突显了从复杂的FHIR资源中检索数据的实际挑战以及对其进行推理的困难，这两者都严重影响了问答性能。

Conclusion: 我们公开了FHIR-AgentBench数据集和评估套件，以促进可重复的研究和开发用于临床应用的稳健、可靠的LLM代理。

Abstract: The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for
clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data
models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing
benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to
evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical
questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically
evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies
(direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns
(single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs.
code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of
retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning
over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We
publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite
(https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research
and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.

### [3] [Readme_AI: Dynamic Context Construction for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19322)
*Millie Vyas,Timothy Blattner,Alden Dima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的协议，用于动态地将大型语言模型（LLMs）定位在专门的所有者提供的数据中，以增强LLMs的响应并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）经过大量数据的训练，但在特定用户查询的上下文中仍可能提供不准确或不可靠的信息。给定查询特定的上下文可以显著提高其响应的有用性。

Method: 本文提出了一种规范，可以用于为数据源动态构建上下文。数据源所有者创建一个包含元数据的文件，供LLMs在处理与数据集相关的查询时使用。为了演示所提出的规范，我们创建了一个原型Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP)服务器，该服务器从数据源检索元数据并使用它来动态构建上下文。

Result: 通过使用Readme_AI，LLM能够关于Hedgehog库及其使用进行推理，并且甚至可以从Hedgehog开发者提供的Readme_AI文件中包含的示例生成代码。

Conclusion: 本文的主要贡献是一个可扩展的协议，用于在专门的所有者提供的数据中动态地将大型语言模型（LLMs）进行定位，从而增强LLMs的响应并减少幻觉。

Abstract: Despite being trained on significant amounts of data, Large Language Models
(LLMs) can provide inaccurate or unreliable information in the context of a
user's specific query. Given query-specific context significantly improves the
usefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can
be used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner
creates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about
dataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created
a prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the
metadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some
features that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that
represent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading
and parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and
grouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for
the LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this
early prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library,
for which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses
containing hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that
it is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code
interpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by
Hedgehog's developer. Our primary contribution is a extensible protocol for
dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, enhancing
responses from LLMs and reducing hallucinations. The source code for the
Readme_AI tool is posted here: https://github.com/usnistgov/readme_ai .

### [4] [Magnitude Matters: a Superior Class of Similarity Metrics for Holistic Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19323)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的向量比较方法，能够在需要整体语义理解的任务中显著提高性能，但在某些任务中效果不佳，指出了未来研究的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的向量比较方法主要依赖于原始点积和余弦相似性，但它们分别存在无界性和忽略幅度信息的问题。本文旨在提出一种更合理地整合向量幅度和对齐的新方法。

Method: 本文提出了两种新的相似性度量方法：Overlap Similarity (OS)和Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity (HTS)，并使用四种最先进的句子嵌入模型在八个标准NLP基准数据集上进行了全面评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，在需要整体语义理解的任务中，OS和HTS在均方误差上显著优于原始点积和余弦相似性。然而，在测试高度细微组合语义的任务中，这些方法没有表现出优势。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的无参数、考虑向量幅度的相似性度量方法，包括Overlap Similarity (OS)和Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity (HTS)。实验结果表明，在需要整体语义理解的任务中，这些方法在均方误差上显著优于原始点积和余弦相似性。然而，在测试高度细微组合语义的任务中，这些方法并没有表现出优势，这指出了未来研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Vector comparison in high dimensions is a fundamental task in NLP, yet it is
dominated by two baselines: the raw dot product, which is unbounded and
sensitive to vector norms, and the cosine similarity, which discards magnitude
information entirely. This paper challenges both standards by proposing and
rigorously evaluating a new class of parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity
metrics. I introduce two such functions, Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic
Tangent Similarity (HTS), designed to integrate vector magnitude and alignment
in a more principled manner. To ensure that my findings are robust and
generalizable, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation using four
state-of-the-art sentence embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2,
all-mpnet-base-v2, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, and BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) across
a diverse suite of eight standard NLP benchmarks, including STS-B, SICK, Quora,
and PAWS. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance, my
results are definitive: on the tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding
(paraphrase and inference), both OS and HTS provide a statistically significant
improvement in Mean Squared Error over both the raw dot product and cosine
similarity, regardless of the underlying embedding model.Crucially, my findings
delineate the specific domain of advantage for these metrics: for tasks
requiring holistic semantic understanding like paraphrase and inference, my
magnitude-aware metrics offer a statistically superior alternative. This
significant improvement was not observed on benchmarks designed to test highly
nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B), identifying the challenge of
representing compositional text as a distinct and important direction for
future work.

### [5] [How Much of Your Data Can Suck? Thresholds for Domain Performance and Emergent Misalignment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19325)
*Jian Ouyang,Arman T,Ge Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了错误数据对大型语言模型在监督微调期间的表现和安全的影响，发现即使少量错误数据也会显著降低性能，强调了高质量数据整理的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在金融、编程、法律和健康等广泛领域变得越来越重要，但微调错误数据可能导致“新兴不对齐”，产生与任务无关的有害或欺骗性输出。

Method: 本研究评估了在不同比例（10%至90%）的明显和微妙错误数据下，gpt-4o模型在四个领域（编程、金融、健康和法律）中的表现。

Result: 即使少量的错误数据（10-25%）也会显著降低领域性能，并且不会影响道德对齐。至少需要50%的正确数据，模型才能持续恢复强大的性能，尽管它们很少能与基础模型的稳健性和安全性相媲美。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了错误数据的成本很高，突显了在高风险应用中对极高质量的数据整理的迫切需求，或者在不需要不必要的微调的情况下利用稳健的基础模型。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of incorrect data on the performance and
safety of large language models (LLMs), specifically gpt-4o, during supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Although LLMs become increasingly vital across broad domains
like finance, coding, law, and health, fine-tuning on incorrect data can lead
to "emergent misalignment," producing harmful or deceptive outputs unrelated to
the intended task. We evaluate gpt-4o models fine-tuned with varying ratios
(10\% to 90\% correct) of both obviously and subtly incorrect data across four
domains: coding, finance, health, and legal. Our findings show that even modest
amounts of incorrect data (10-25\%) dramatically degrade domain performance and
not moral alignment. A clear threshold of at least 50\% correct data is needed
for models to consistently recover strong performance, though they rarely match
the robustness and safety of the base model, which exhibits near-perfect
alignment and zero dangerous completions out-of-the-box. This research
emphasizes that the cost of incorrect data is heavy, highlighting the critical
need for extremely high-quality data curation or, alternatively, leveraging
robust base models without unnecessary fine-tuning for high-stakes
applications.

### [6] [Unveiling the Merits and Defects of LLMs in Automatic Review Generation for Scientific Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19326)
*Ruochi Li,Haoxuan Zhang,Edward Gehringer,Ting Xiao,Junhua Ding,Haihua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of LLMs in generating peer reviews, highlighting their strengths in descriptive content but limitations in identifying weaknesses and adapting feedback based on paper quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of scientific submissions has strained the traditional peer-review process, prompting the need for automated review generation using LLMs. However, the limitations of LLMs in critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity require systematic evaluation.

Method: The study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating semantic similarity analysis and structured knowledge graph metrics. It constructs a large-scale benchmark of 1,683 papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS, and generates reviews using five LLMs.

Result: LLMs perform well in capturing main contributions and methodologies but underperform in identifying weaknesses and raising substantive questions. GPT-4o generates 15.74% more entities in strengths sections but 59.42% fewer entities in weaknesses sections compared to human reviewers.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in generating descriptive and affirmational feedback but struggle with identifying weaknesses and adjusting feedback based on paper quality. The study provides empirical foundations for improving LLM-assisted reviewing tools.

Abstract: The surge in scientific submissions has placed increasing strain on the
traditional peer-review process, prompting the exploration of large language
models (LLMs) for automated review generation. While LLMs demonstrate
competence in producing structured and coherent feedback, their capacity for
critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity remains
limited. To systematically evaluate these aspects, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that integrates semantic similarity analysis and
structured knowledge graph metrics to assess LLM-generated reviews against
human-written counterparts. We construct a large-scale benchmark of 1,683
papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS in multiple years, and
generate reviews using five LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs perform well in
descriptive and affirmational content, capturing the main contributions and
methodologies of the original work, with GPT-4o highlighted as an illustrative
example, generating 15.74% more entities than human reviewers in the strengths
section of good papers in ICLR 2025. However, they consistently underperform in
identifying weaknesses, raising substantive questions, and adjusting feedback
based on paper quality. GPT-4o produces 59.42% fewer entities than real
reviewers in the weaknesses and increases node count by only 5.7% from good to
weak papers, compared to 50% in human reviews. Similar trends are observed
across all conferences, years, and models, providing empirical foundations for
understanding the merits and defects of LLM-generated reviews and informing the
development of future LLM-assisted reviewing tools. Data, code, and more
detailed results are publicly available at

### [7] [A systematic review of trial-matching pipelines using large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19327)
*Braxton A. Morrison,Madhumita Sushil,Jacob S. Young*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了将大型语言模型应用于临床试验匹配的进展，指出GPT-4模型在匹配和资格提取方面表现优异，但成本较高。有前途的策略包括使用专有LLM进行零样本提示、先进检索方法，以及微调小型开源模型以保护数据隐私。关键挑战包括获取真实数据集和降低部署成本，同时减少幻觉、数据泄露和偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将患者与临床试验选项匹配对于发现新治疗方法至关重要，尤其是在肿瘤学领域。然而，手动匹配劳动密集且容易出错，导致招募延迟。结合大型语言模型的管道提供了有前景的解决方案。

Method: 本文进行了系统回顾，分析了2020年至2025年间从三个学术数据库和一个预印本服务器中发表的研究，识别基于大型语言模型（LLM）的临床试验匹配方法。

Result: 在126篇独特的文章中，31篇符合纳入标准。研究重点包括仅患者与标准匹配（n=4）、仅患者与试验匹配（n=10）、仅试验与患者匹配（n=2）、仅二元资格分类（n=1）或综合任务（n=14）。十六篇使用合成数据；十四篇使用真实患者数据；一篇同时使用两者。数据集和评估指标的差异限制了跨研究的可比性。在有直接比较的研究中，GPT-4模型在匹配和资格提取方面始终优于其他模型，尽管成本更高。有前途的策略包括使用专有LLM如GPT-4o模型的零样本提示、先进的检索方法，以及微调较小的开源模型以保护数据隐私，当无法将大型模型整合到医院基础设施时。关键挑战包括获取足够大的真实数据集，以及与部署相关的挑战，如降低成本、减少幻觉、数据泄露和偏见。

Conclusion: 本文综述了将大型语言模型应用于临床试验匹配的进展，指出了有希望的方向和关键限制。标准化指标、更真实的测试集以及对成本效益和公平性的关注对于更广泛的部署至关重要。

Abstract: Matching patients to clinical trial options is critical for identifying novel
treatments, especially in oncology. However, manual matching is labor-intensive
and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large
language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic
review of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases
and one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial
matching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies
focused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only
(n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only
(n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real
patient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics
limited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the
GPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in
matching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising
strategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o
model, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models
for data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital
infrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently
large real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as
reducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. This
review synthesizes progress in applying LLMs to clinical trial matching,
highlighting promising directions and key limitations. Standardized metrics,
more realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness will be
critical for broader deployment.

TL;DR: 研究考察了模型大小、温度和提示风格如何影响大型语言模型在评估临床推理技能时的对齐情况，并发现模型大小是LLM与人类评分对齐的关键因素。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在了解模型大小、温度和提示风格如何影响大型语言模型在评估临床推理技能时的对齐情况。

Method: 研究考察了模型大小、温度和提示风格如何影响大型语言模型（LLMs）在自身内部、模型之间以及与人类在评估临床推理技能方面的对齐情况。

Result: 模型大小被发现是LLM与人类评分对齐的关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在多个层面检查对齐的重要性。

Abstract: We examined how model size, temperature, and prompt style affect Large
Language Models' (LLMs) alignment within itself, between models, and with human
in assessing clinical reasoning skills. Model size emerged as a key factor in
LLM-human score alignment. Study highlights the importance of checking
alignments across multiple levels.

### [9] [Quantifying Compositionality of Classic and State-of-the-Art Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19332)
*Zhijin Guo,Chenhao Xue,Zhaozhen Xu,Hongbo Bo,Yuxuan Ye,Janet B. Pierrehumbert,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两步的评估方法来量化语言模型中的加法组合性，并通过实验验证了不同训练阶段和模型结构中的组合性信号。结果表明，组合性在后期训练阶段和深层中更强，但顶层有所下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型需要正确推广到新的表达方式，这要求它们能够利用组合意义。然而，现有的方法要么过于强调组合性（如静态词嵌入），要么缺乏对上下文导致的意义变化的限制（如生成式Transformer模型）。因此，需要一种更平衡的方法来评估和量化组合性。

Method: 论文提出了一种两步的广义评估方法来量化加法组合性：(i) 通过典型相关分析测量已知实体属性与其嵌入之间的线性关系；(ii) 通过重建未见过的属性组合的嵌入并检查重建指标（如L2损失、余弦相似性和检索准确性）来评估加法泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，在不同数据模态和训练阶段中，组合性信号在后期训练阶段和Transformer模型的深层中更强，但在顶层有所下降。此外，提出的评估方法能够捕捉到线性组合失败的情况。

Conclusion: 论文指出，语言模型需要在适当的情况下利用组合意义才能正确推广到新的表达方式。静态词嵌入如Word2vec对组合性做出了过于强烈的主张，而最先进的生成式Transformer模型和图模型则在另一方面走得太远，因为它们没有对意义因上下文而变化的限制。为了量化加法组合性，作者提出了一种两步的广义评估方法，并通过实验验证了不同数据模态和训练阶段的组合性信号。

Abstract: For language models to generalize correctly to novel expressions, it is
critical that they exploit access compositional meanings when this is
justified. Even if we don't know what a "pelp" is, we can use our knowledge of
numbers to understand that "ten pelps" makes more pelps than "two pelps".
Static word embeddings such as Word2vec made strong, indeed excessive, claims
about compositionality. The SOTA generative, transformer models and graph
models, however, go too far in the other direction by providing no real limits
on shifts in meaning due to context. To quantify the additive compositionality,
we formalize a two-step, generalized evaluation that (i) measures the linearity
between known entity attributes and their embeddings via canonical correlation
analysis, and (ii) evaluates additive generalization by reconstructing
embeddings for unseen attribute combinations and checking reconstruction
metrics such as L2 loss, cosine similarity, and retrieval accuracy. These
metrics also capture failure cases where linear composition breaks down.
Sentences, knowledge graphs, and word embeddings are evaluated and tracked the
compositionality across all layers and training stages. Stronger compositional
signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in
deeper layers of the transformer-based model before a decline at the top layer.

*Chengkai Huang,Junda Wu,Zhouhang Xie,Yu Xia,Rui Wang,Tong Yu,Subrata Mitra,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了POPE框架，用于LLM的离线多样化偏好评估和对齐，通过结合协作效用和多样性组件，并使用可分解的逆倾向评分估计器进行评估，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好对齐数据集通常是在与评估的LLM显著不同的策略下记录的，而现有的离策略估计器仅关注总体效用，忽略了偏好多样性。因此，将离策略评估扩展到多样化的偏好对齐仍然是一个开放问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为POPE的框架，该框架结合了协作效用组件和多样性组件，以实现对LLM的离线多样化偏好评估和对齐。此外，还推导出了可分解的逆倾向评分（IPS）估计器，用于从记录的交互中估计奖励。

Result: 实证结果表明，POPE能够有效地增强多样化的响应生成，并保持模型在下游任务上的通用能力。

Conclusion: POPE能够有效增强多样化的响应生成，并保持模型在下游任务上的通用能力。

Abstract: Personalized preference alignment for LLMs with diverse human preferences
requires evaluation and alignment methods that capture pluralism. Most existing
preference alignment datasets are logged under policies that differ
substantially from the evaluated LLMs, and existing off-policy estimators focus
solely on overall utility while ignoring preference pluralism. Extending
Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore,
remains an open question. Thus, we propose the Pluralistic Off-Policy
Evaluation (POPE), the first framework for offline pluralistic preference
evaluation and alignment in LLMs. POPE includes a unified reward function that
combines (1) a collaborative utility component derived from human preference
signals (e.g., upvotes or relevance scores) and (2) a diversity component
inspired by entropy-based coverage measures, together reflecting pluralistic
alignment. Furthermore, to estimate this reward from logged interactions, we
derive decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators that separately
evaluate relevance and diversity. Theoretically, we prove that our decomposed
IPS estimators establish a lower bound on their variance. With the off-policy
evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to
further enhance pluralistic alignment. Empirical results demonstrate that POPE
efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation and maintains the models'
general capabilities on downstream tasks

*Qingsong Wang,Tao Wu,Wang Lin,Yueying Feng,Gongsheng Yuan,Chang Yao,Jingyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLAF, a framework that aligns LLM outputs with user cognition by addressing knowledge-level and presentation-style misalignment, and demonstrates its effectiveness through empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to adapt content to users with differing cognitive capacities, leading to a phenomenon we term cognitive misalignment. This issue arises in two forms: knowledge-level misalignment and presentation-style misalignment.

Method: We propose the Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), which integrates a capability-aware retrieval module based on a hierarchical knowledge graph and a style optimization module guided by Bloom's taxonomy and preference learning. Additionally, a knowledge-controllable generation component ensures consistency and relevance throughout the output.

Result: Empirical results show that CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles.

Conclusion: CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles, offering a robust solution to cognitive-level alignment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
open-ended generation tasks. However, they often struggle to adapt content to
users with differing cognitive capacities, leading to a phenomenon we term
cognitive misalignment. This issue arises in two forms: knowledge-level
misalignment, where content is too complex or too simplistic relative to user
understanding, and presentation-style misalignment, where the structure or tone
hinders effective comprehension. To address these challenges, we propose the
Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), a general-purpose generation
framework that aligns both knowledge complexity and presentation style with
user cognition. CLAF integrates a capability-aware retrieval module based on a
hierarchical knowledge graph and a style optimization module guided by Bloom's
taxonomy and preference learning. Additionally, a knowledge-controllable
generation component ensures consistency and relevance throughout the output.
To support training and evaluation, we construct SCALE, a cognitively annotated
dataset containing responses at multiple comprehension levels per query.
Empirical results show that CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness
of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles, offering a robust solution to
cognitive-level alignment in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 本文是首次对那加语进行词性标注的研究，使用条件随机场方法取得了较高的准确率、精确率和F1分数。

Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language,
a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily
as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in
northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has
been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no
work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The
aim of this work is to identify the part-of-speech for a given sentence in the
Nagamese language. An annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens is created and applied
machine learning technique known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Using CRF,
an overall tagging accuracy of 85.70%; precision, recall of 86%, and f1-score
of 85% is achieved.
  Keywords. Nagamese, NLP, part-of-speech, machine learning, CRF.

### [14] [SCORE: A Semantic Evaluation Framework for Generative Document Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19345)
*Renyu Li,Antonio Jimeno Yepes,Yao You,Kamil Pluciński,Maximilian Operlejn,Crag Wolfe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCORE is a new evaluation framework for document parsing systems that addresses the limitations of traditional metrics by embracing representational diversity while enforcing semantic rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics misclassify the diversity of outputs from multi-modal generative document parsing systems as error, penalizing valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.

Method: SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation) is an interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates adjusted edit distance, token-level diagnostics, table evaluation with spatial tolerance and semantic alignment, and hierarchy-aware consistency checks.

Result: SCORE consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard metrics. It corrected cases where traditional metrics penalized systems, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid interpretations. Additionally, it reproduced traditional scores without requiring object-detection pipelines.

Conclusion: SCORE establishes foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.

Abstract: Multi-modal generative document parsing systems challenge traditional
evaluation: unlike deterministic OCR or layout models, they often produce
semantically correct yet structurally divergent outputs. Conventional
metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing
valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.
  We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an
interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance
for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish
hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance
and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together,
these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity
while enforcing semantic rigor.
  Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE
consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard
metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics
penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE
corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid
interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a
format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g.,
table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines,
demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive
evaluation.
  By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and
providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes
foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical
benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.

TL;DR: 本研究通过结合基于词典的情感分析和深度学习分类模型，对ChatGPT和DeepSeek的用户评论进行分析，发现ChatGPT的积极情感更多，且基于深度学习的分类方法效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究主要集中在基于词典的策略或预测性深度学习模型上，而本研究则对基于大型语言模型的应用程序的用户满意度进行了广泛调查。

Method: 本研究采用了一种新颖的双视角方法，对ChatGPT和DeepSeek的用户评论进行分析，结合了基于词典的情感分析（TextBlob）与深度学习分类模型，包括卷积神经网络（CNN）和双向长短期记忆（Bi LSTM）网络。

Result: 实验结果表明，ChatGPT获得的积极情感显著多于DeepSeek。此外，基于深度学习的分类表现优于基于词典的分析，CNN在准确率上达到了96.41%，并且对负面评论进行了近乎完美的分类，同时对于中性和积极情感也具有较高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 本研究为测量基于大型语言模型的应用程序的情感设定了新的方法论标准，并为寻求改进以用户为中心的人工智能系统设计的开发人员和研究人员提供了实用的见解。

Abstract: This study presents a novel dual-perspective approach to analyzing user
reviews for ChatGPT and DeepSeek on the Google Play Store, integrating
lexicon-based sentiment analysis (TextBlob) with deep learning classification
models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long
Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) Networks. Unlike prior research, which focuses on
either lexicon-based strategies or predictive deep learning models in
isolation, this study conducts an extensive investigation into user
satisfaction with Large Language Model (LLM) based applications. A Dataset of
4,000 authentic user reviews was collected, which were carefully preprocessed
and subjected to oversampling to achieve balanced classes. The balanced test
set of 1,700 Reviews were used for model testing. Results from the experiments
reveal that ChatGPT received significantly more positive sentiment than
DeepSeek. Furthermore, deep learning based classification demonstrated superior
performance over lexicon analysis, with CNN outperforming Bi-LSTM by achieving
96.41 percent accuracy and near perfect classification of negative reviews,
alongside high F1-scores for neutral and positive sentiments. This research
sets a new methodological standard for measuring sentiment in LLM-based
applications and provides practical insights for developers and researchers
seeking to improve user-centric AI system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注从完整的多模态训练数据中学习联合模态表示，无法处理现实场景中常见的模态缺失问题。

Method: 提出了一种分层软提示模型TriSPrompt，集成了三种提示：模态感知（MA）提示、模态缺失（MM）提示和互视（MV）提示，以有效检测不完整多模态数据中的谣言。

Result: TriSPrompt在三个真实世界基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: TriSPrompt在三个真实世界基准测试中表现出色，相比最先进的方法实现了超过13%的准确率提升。

Abstract: The widespread presence of incomplete modalities in multimodal data poses a
significant challenge to achieving accurate rumor detection. Existing
multimodal rumor detection methods primarily focus on learning joint modality
representations from \emph{complete} multimodal training data, rendering them
ineffective in addressing the common occurrence of \emph{missing modalities} in
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical soft prompt
model \textsf{TriSPrompt}, which integrates three types of prompts,
\textit{i.e.}, \emph{modality-aware} (MA) prompt, \emph{modality-missing} (MM)
prompt, and \emph{mutual-views} (MV) prompt, to effectively detect rumors in
incomplete multimodal data. The MA prompt captures both heterogeneous
information from specific modalities and homogeneous features from available
data, aiding in modality recovery. The MM prompt models missing states in
incomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The
MV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\textit{i.e.}, text and
image) and objective (\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively
detecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that \textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets are available at

An automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data for a given city and converts it into multiple supervision formats tailored to key spatial tasks. LLMs are pretrained and fine-tuned on these representations using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models.

Result: Models trained via RoadMind significantly outperform strong baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with advanced prompt engineering.

Conclusion: RoadMind demonstrates the potential of structured geospatial data to enhance language models with robust spatial reasoning, enabling more effective offline AI systems for disaster response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估主要关注响应是否符合用户偏好，但忽略了事实准确性这一重要维度。本文旨在填补这一评估空白。

Method: 本文提出了PERG框架和PERGData数据集，用于评估LLM的鲁棒性，并引入了Pref-Aligner方法来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前LLM在鲁棒个性化方面存在困难，即使是最强模型（如GPT-4.1、LLaMA3-70B）在无个性化情况下也会有5%的错误率，而较小的模型（如7B规模）错误率超过20%。

Conclusion: 本文指出当前评估方法存在不足，并引入了PERG框架和PERGData数据集，以支持更可靠、符合用户需求的LLM部署。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in personalizing the responses
of large language models (LLMs). While existing evaluations primarily focus on
whether a response aligns with a user's preferences, we argue that factuality
is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension. In the context of
personalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both
factually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we
introduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along
with a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different
model families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that
current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models
(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously
successful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)
can fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is
significantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user
preference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage
approach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work
highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools
and metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的对抗性攻击方法，称为语义表示攻击，通过利用具有相同有害含义的多样化响应来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法通常针对精确的肯定回答，存在收敛有限、提示不自然和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 我们提出了语义表示启发式搜索算法，通过在逐步扩展过程中保持可解释性，高效生成语义连贯且简洁的对抗性提示。

Result: 我们在18个LLM上平均达到了89.41%的攻击成功率，其中11个模型达到了100%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在攻击成功率上取得了前所未有的成绩，同时保持了隐蔽性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to
prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent
them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure,
here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high
computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that
fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the
semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent
harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and
prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to
efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by
maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and
demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates
(89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while
maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our
Semantic Representation Attack.
  The code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究发现，标准的离线评估无法准确反映语言模型在实际应用中的行为，因为个性化会显著影响模型的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的离线评估无法反映语言模型在实际应用中的行为，因为个性化会影响模型的表现。

Method: 通过让800名真实用户使用ChatGPT和Gemini向他们的聊天界面提出基准和其他问题，进行现场评估并与离线评估进行比较。

Result: 实证证据表明，相同的基准问题在不同的用户聊天会话中可能会产生显著不同的响应。

Conclusion: 标准的离线评估无法捕捉语言模型在实际中的行为，因为个性化会根本性地改变模型的行为。

Abstract: Standard offline evaluations for language models -- a series of independent,
state-less inferences made by models -- fail to capture how language models
actually behave in practice, where personalization fundamentally alters model
behavior. For instance, identical benchmark questions to the same language
model can produce markedly different responses when prompted to a state-less
system, in one user's chat session, or in a different user's chat session. In
this work, we provide empirical evidence showcasing this phenomenon by
comparing offline evaluations to field evaluations conducted by having 800 real
users of ChatGPT and Gemini pose benchmark and other provided questions to
their chat interfaces.

*Wannes Janssens,Matthias Bogaert,Dirk Van den Poel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合BERTopic和大型语言模型的框架，以提高社交媒体数据的主题建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的BERTopic框架在处理社交媒体数据时效果不佳，因为社交媒体数据通常嘈杂且稀疏，导致过多重叠的主题。而使用大型语言模型进行端到端主题建模的方法通常需要大量的计算开销，限制了其在大数据环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 我们提出了一种结合BERTopic进行主题生成和大型语言模型进行主题简化的框架。该方法首先生成一组初始主题并构建每个主题的表示，然后将这些表示作为输入提供给语言模型，语言模型迭代地识别并合并语义相似的主题。

Result: 我们在三个Twitter/X数据集和四个不同的语言模型上评估了该方法。结果表明，我们的方法在增强主题多样性和一致性方面表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在增强主题多样性方面优于基线方法，并且在许多情况下提高了主题的一致性，但对数据集特征和初始参数选择有一定的敏感性。

Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical
clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While
effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy
and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work
explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling.
However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead,
limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a
framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language
models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics
and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then
provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and
merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three
Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms
the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases,
coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial
parameter selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PPSD is a novel approach that pipelines draft and verification work to achieve efficient self-speculative decoding in LLMs, resulting in significant acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the issue where EESD may not achieve expected acceleration due to failed predictions, leading to negative speedup.

Method: PPSD configures model layers as a pipeline with early-exit (draft) computations and remaining-layer (verification) computations overlapping, and interleaves drafting and verification per token.

Result: PPSD achieves speedup ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x on diverse benchmarks, almost achieving optimal acceleration at fixed acceptance rate and exit position.

Conclusion: PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in self-speculative LLM inference, showcasing its advancement in providing efficient self-speculation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive generation quality, but incur
very high inference cost because each output token is generated
auto-regressively through all model layers. Early-exit based self-speculative
decoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many
approaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such
draft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and
selected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the
vast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft
cost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To
mitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD)
that fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is
wasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the
model layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and
remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and
verification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its
final layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a
verify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly
analogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical
results confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in
self-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup
ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration
at the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in
providing efficient self-speculation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对韩语工具使用的优化小规模语言模型代理架构P-C-G，通过角色分离规划、调用和生成，并应用韩语优先的价值策略，以减少执行失败。评估显示P-C-G在保持可接受延迟的同时，提供了具有竞争力的工具使用准确性和端到端质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少在韩语环境中频繁的韩语到英语代码切换导致的执行失败，我们应用了一个以韩语为先的价值策略。

Method: 我们提出了一个基于小规模语言模型（SLM）的代理架构Planner-Caller-Generator（P-C-G），专门针对韩语工具使用进行了优化。P-C-G通过角色分离规划、调用和生成：规划器生成一个初始批次计划，并有限地重新规划；调用者在联合模式-值验证后返回一个标准化的调用对象；生成器整合工具输出以生成最终答案。

Result: 评估假设了韩语查询和韩语工具/参数规范；它涵盖了单链、多链、缺失参数和缺失函数的场景，并通过LLM-as-a-Judge协议在统一的I/O接口下进行五次运行的平均评估。结果表明，P-C-G在保持可接受延迟的同时，提供了具有竞争力的工具使用准确性和端到端质量。

Conclusion: 结果表明，P-C-G在保持可接受延迟的同时，提供了具有竞争力的工具使用准确性和端到端质量，表明角色专业化的SLM是韩语工具使用代理的一种成本效益高的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose a small-scale language model (SLM) based agent architecture,
Planner-Caller-Generator (P-C-G), optimized for Korean tool use. P-C-G
separates planning, calling, and generation by role: the Planner produces an
initial batch plan with limited on-demand replanning; the Caller returns a
normalized call object after joint schema-value validation; and the Generator
integrates tool outputs to produce the final answer. We apply a Korean-first
value policy to reduce execution failures caused by frequent Korean-to-English
code switching in Korean settings. Evaluation assumes Korean queries and Korean
tool/parameter specifications; it covers single-chain, multi-chain,
missing-parameters, and missing-functions scenarios, and is conducted via an
LLM-as-a-Judge protocol averaged over five runs under a unified I/O interface.
Results show that P-C-G delivers competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end
quality while reducing tokens and maintaining acceptable latency, indicating
that role-specialized SLMs are a cost-effective alternative for Korean tool-use
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动调查方法将提纲写作视为整体流程中的步骤，导致生成的提纲缺乏对调查主题的深入理解和精细风格。

Method: 将提纲写作视为一个端到端的任务，从论文元数据生成层次化的结构提纲，并采用两阶段训练方法结合监督微调和强化学习。

Result: Meow框架在结构保真度和风格一致性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: Meow框架能够高效地生成结构化且忠实的提纲，展示了强大的性能。

Abstract: As academic paper publication numbers grow exponentially, conducting in-depth
surveys with LLMs automatically has become an inevitable trend. Outline
writing, which aims to systematically organize related works, is critical for
automated survey generation. Yet existing automatic survey methods treat
outline writing as mere workflow steps in the overall pipeline. Such
template-based workflows produce outlines that lack in-depth understanding of
the survey topic and fine-grained styles. To address these limitations, we
propose Meow, the first metadata-driven outline writing framework that produces
organized and faithful outlines efficiently. Specifically, we first formulate
outline writing as an end-to-end task that generates hierarchical structured
outlines from paper metadata. We then curate a high-quality dataset of surveys
from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and establish systematic evaluation metrics
for outline quality assessment. Finally, we employ a two-stage training
approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our 8B
reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity
and stylistic coherence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to
their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However,
without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized
knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that
strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially
improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this
infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields
insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic
forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the
phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic
experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point:
each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention
capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale
consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a
knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain
knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts.
Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets
validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.

### [28] [A Pipeline to Assess Merging Methods via Behavior and Internals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19476)
*Yutaro Sigris,Andreas Waldis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的评估流程，用于分析合并模型的行为和内部结构。结果显示，合并模型在性能上通常介于两个父模型之间，但在某些语言现象的编码上可能优于父模型。同时，行为和内部评估之间的相关性较弱，表明需要更全面的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究从纯粹的行为角度研究合并模型，而我们提供了第一个全面的视角，通过评估和连接其行为和内部结构来提供更深入的理解。

Method: 我们提出了一个新的评估流程，首先将多个父LM合并，然后根据它们在下游任务（如MMLU）上的行为以及内部编码的语言能力，与初始模型进行比较。

Result: 我们的结果表明，合并方法对行为和内部结构有不同的影响。虽然合并模型的性能通常介于两个父模型之间，但它们关于语言现象（尤其是形态学和句法）的编码信息可以超过父模型。此外，我们发现行为和内部评估之间的排名相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，合并方法对行为和内部结构有不同的影响。虽然合并模型的性能通常介于两个父模型之间，但它们关于语言现象（尤其是形态学和句法）的编码信息可以超过父模型。此外，我们发现行为和内部评估之间的排名相关性较弱。通过我们的管道和初步结果，我们强调了需要对模型合并方法进行更全面的评估，以超越潜在的表面行为优势，获得对其能力和可靠性的忠实理解。

Abstract: Merging methods combine the weights of multiple language models (LMs) to
leverage their capacities, such as for domain adaptation. While existing
studies investigate merged models from a solely behavioral perspective, we
offer the first comprehensive view by assessing and connecting their behavior
and internals. We present a novel evaluation pipeline that first merges
multiple parent LMs, and then evaluates the merged models in comparison to the
initial ones based on their behavior on downstream tasks, like MMLU, and the
internal encoded linguistic competence. We showcase this pipeline by assessing
the merging of instruction fine-tuned with math- and code-adapted LMs from the
Qwen2.5 family. Our results show that merging methods impacts behavior and
internals differently. While the performance of merged models is typically
between that of the two parent models, their encoded information about
linguistic phenomena, particularly in morphology and syntax, can surpass the
parent models. Moreover, we find weak ranking correlation between this behavior
and internal evaluation. With our pipeline and initial results, we emphasize
the need for more comprehensive evaluations of model merging methods to gain a
faithful understanding of their capabilities and reliability, beyond potential
superficial behavioral advances.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否编码了框架语义的潜在知识，特别是框架识别这一核心挑战。

Method: 使用基于提示的推理评估模型在FrameNet词汇资源上的表现，以及对模型进行微调以提高领域内的准确性。

Result: 模型在没有显式监督的情况下可以有效地进行框架识别，并且在微调后显著提高了领域内的准确性，同时在域外基准上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模型能够生成语义连贯的框架定义，表明模型内部已内化了框架语义的理解。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models encode latent knowledge of frame
semantics, focusing on frame identification, a core challenge in frame semantic
parsing that involves selecting the appropriate semantic frame for a target
word in context. Using the FrameNet lexical resource, we evaluate models under
prompt-based inference and observe that they can perform frame identification
effectively even without explicit supervision. To assess the impact of
task-specific training, we fine-tune the model on FrameNet data, which
substantially improves in-domain accuracy while generalizing well to
out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that the models can generate
semantically coherent frame definitions, highlighting the model's internalized
understanding of frame semantics.

can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error
scores by up to 23.83%.

Abstract: This work investigates retrieval augmented generation as an efficient
strategy for automatic context discovery in context-aware Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) system, in order to improve transcription accuracy in the
presence of rare or out-of-vocabulary terms. However, identifying the right
context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an
efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in
ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large
language models (LLMs) are also evaluated: (1) large language model (LLM)-based
context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript
correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage
difference) relative to using no-context, while the oracle context results in a
reduction of up to 24.1%.

Conclusion: 本文提出的ExPE方法在因果语言建模中显著降低了困惑度，展示了其在处理更长序列时的优越性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to position embeddings in transformer
models, named "Exact Positional Embeddings" (ExPE). An absolute positional
embedding method that can extrapolate to sequences of lengths longer than the
ones it was trained on. Traditional transformer models rely on absolute or
relative position embeddings to incorporate positional information into token
embeddings, which often struggle with extrapolation to sequences longer than
those seen during training. Our proposed method utilizes a novel embedding
strategy that encodes exact positional information by overriding specific
dimensions of the embedding vectors, thereby enabling a more precise
representation of token positions. The proposed approach not only maintains the
integrity of the original embeddings but also enhances the model's ability to
generalize to more extended sequences. In causal language modeling, our ExPE
embeddings significantly reduce perplexity compared to rotary and sinusoidal
embeddings, when tested on sequences longer than those used in training.

Abstract: Cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques keep reshaping our view
of the world. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications such
as ChatGPT have shown the capability of generating human-like conversation on
extensive topics. Due to the impressive performance on a variety of
language-related tasks (e.g., open-domain question answering, translation, and
document summarization), one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be
brought by the LLMs with broader real-world applications (e.g., customer
service, education and accessibility, and scientific discovery). Inspired by
their success, this paper will offer an overview of state-of-the-art LLMs and
their integration into a wide range of academic disciplines, including: (1)
arts, letters, and law (e.g., history, philosophy, political science, arts and
architecture, law), (2) economics and business (e.g., finance, economics,
accounting, marketing), and (3) science and engineering (e.g., mathematics,
physics and mechanical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, life
sciences and bioengineering, earth sciences and civil engineering, computer
science and electrical engineering). Integrating humanity and technology, in
this paper, we will explore how LLMs are shaping research and practice in these
fields, while also discussing key limitations, open challenges, and future
directions in the era of generative AI. The review of how LLMs are engaged
across disciplines-along with key observations and insights-can help
researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting LLMs to advance their
works in diverse real-world applications.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估大型语言模型在开放领域和开放设置中作为战略提问者的性能，并探索如何改进这些问题的质量。

Method: 研究引入了GuessingGame协议，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）作为战略提问者的性能。通过两个信息增益（IG）度量来衡量问题质量：一种基于贝叶斯的方法，另一种基于熵的方法。

Result: 研究发现，较高的信息增益（IG）强烈预测了效率：IG增加一个标准差可以将预期游戏长度减少43%。由IG指导的提示约束，如强制问题多样性，使较弱的模型显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 研究显示，LLM中的问题提问是可衡量和可改进的，并且对于交互式推理至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce GuessingGame, a protocol for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) as strategic question-askers in open-ended, open-domain settings. A
Guesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an
Oracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question
quality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that
tracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an
entropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are
model-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple
models and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a
one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\%.
Prompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity,
enable weaker models to significantly improve performance. These results show
that question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for
interactive reasoning.

quality of a given translation against a human reference and (ii) selecting
which of two translations is generationally closer to an original source
document.

Abstract: Patents play a critical role in driving technological innovation by granting
inventors exclusive rights to their inventions. However the process of drafting
a patent application is often expensive and time-consuming, making it a prime
candidate for automation. Despite recent advancements in language models,
several challenges hinder the development of robust automated patent drafting
systems. First, the information within a patent application is highly
confidential, which often prevents the use of closed-source LLMs for automating
this task. Second, the process of drafting a patent application is difficult
for even the most advanced language models due to their long context, technical
writing style, and specialized domain knowledge. To address these challenges,
we introduce AutoSpec, a secure, agentic framework for Automatically drafting
patent Specification. Our approach decomposes the drafting process into a
sequence of manageable subtasks, each solvable by smaller, open-source language
models enhanced with custom tools tailored for drafting patent specification.
To assess our system, we design a novel evaluation protocol in collaboration
with experienced patent attorneys. Our automatic and expert evaluations show
that AutoSpec outperforms existing baselines on a patent drafting task.

Abstract: Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly
influenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver
yielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at
intersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors.
Traditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and
context-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due
to their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited
interpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for
extracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling
of driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal
LLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge,
structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and
context-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application
of modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art
LLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves
the highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These
findings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and
computational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in
real-world pedestrian safety systems.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for personalized AI systems, there is growing interest
in aligning the behavior of large language models (LLMs) with human traits such
as personality. Previous attempts to induce personality in LLMs have shown
promising results, but they struggle to capture the continuous and
multidimensional nature of human traits. In this work, we propose a novel
method for personality modulation in LLMs via model merging. Specifically, we
construct personality vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model
from those of the fine-tuned model on a given personality trait. By merging
personality vectors, we enable LLMs to exhibit desired personality traits
without additional training. Extensive experiments show that personality
vectors enable continuous control over trait intensity and support the
composition of multiple traits. Furthermore, personality vectors transfer
across diverse downstream models, suggesting that they encode generalizable
representations of personality. Our code is available at here.

Motivation: 零样本对话状态跟踪（zs-DST）对于使任务导向对话系统能够泛化到新领域至关重要，而无需昂贵的数据注释。然而，动态对话上下文与静态提示之间的语义不对齐导致了跨层协调不灵活、领域干扰和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出了一种名为Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA)的框架，通过增强提示对齐来提高零样本槽位推理。该方法具有分层LoRA架构，用于动态层特定处理，并整合了Spectral Joint Domain-Slot Clustering以识别可转移关联，同时采用Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization (SemSVD-Init)来保留预训练知识。

Result: HiCoLoRA在多领域数据集MultiWOZ和SGD上表现出色，优于基线方法，实现了零样本对话状态跟踪的最先进性能。

Conclusion: HiCoLoRA在多领域数据集MultiWOZ和SGD上的实验表明，它在零样本对话状态跟踪中表现优于基线，达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly
data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between
dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer
coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this,
we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a
framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt
alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic
layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and
higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot
Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear
Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization
(SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain
datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving
SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.

*Pei Zhang,Andong Chen,Xi Chen,Baosong Yang,Derek F. Wong,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多阶段、多任务框架PART，用于解决多语言语音和文本表示对齐的问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在多语言设置中难以对齐语音和文本表示，且冻结LLM参数会限制性能。

Method: 提出了一种多阶段、多任务框架，称为Progressive Alignment Representation Training (PART)，将语言内对齐与跨语言对齐分开。

Result: 在CommonVoice 15、Fleurs、Wenetspeech和CoVoST2上的实验表明，PART超越了传统方法，并能平衡语言特定差异和跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: PART在多语言语音模态对齐中表现出有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have expanded from text to speech, giving rise
to Speech Large Models (SLMs) that support recognition, translation, and
synthesis. A key challenge is aligning speech and text representations, which
becomes harder in multilingual settings. Existing methods often freeze LLM
parameters and train encoders on multilingual data, but this forces
cross-language convergence and limits performance. We introduce Progressive
Alignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task
framework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During
cross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and
text-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding.
Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART
surpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to
balance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These
results demonstrate PART's effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech
modality alignment.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CHURRO，一个专门用于历史文本识别的3B参数开放权重视觉语言模型，并在CHURRO-DS数据集上展示了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的文本识别对于历史文献的研究和保护至关重要。然而，现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）是为现代标准化文本设计的，无法处理历史材料中多样的语言和文字、不规则的布局以及频繁的退化问题。

Method: 本文提出了CHURRO，一个3B参数的开放权重视觉语言模型，专门用于历史文本识别。该模型在CHURRO-DS数据集上进行训练，这是目前最大的历史文本识别数据集。

Result: 在CHURRO-DS测试集上，CHURRO在印刷文本上的归一化Levenshtein相似度达到82.3%，在手写文本上达到70.1%，分别超过了第二好的模型Gemini 2.5 Pro 1.4%和6.5%，同时成本效益提高了15.5倍。

Conclusion: 通过发布模型和数据集，我们旨在促进社区驱动的研究，以提高历史文本的可读性并加速学术研究。

Abstract: Accurate text recognition for historical documents can greatly advance the
study and preservation of cultural heritage. Existing vision-language models
(VLMs), however, are designed for modern, standardized texts and are not
equipped to read the diverse languages and scripts, irregular layouts, and
frequent degradation found in historical materials.
  This paper presents CHURRO, a 3B-parameter open-weight VLM specialized for
historical text recognition. The model is trained on CHURRO-DS, the largest
historical text recognition dataset to date. CHURRO-DS unifies 155 historical
corpora comprising 99,491 pages, spanning 22 centuries of textual heritage
across 46 language clusters, including historical variants and dead languages.
  We evaluate several open-weight and closed VLMs and optical character
recognition (OCR) systems on CHURRO-DS and find that CHURRO outperforms all
other VLMs. On the CHURRO-DS test set, CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and
70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, surpassing the
second-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, by 1.4% and 6.5%, respectively, while being
15.5 times more cost-effective.
  By releasing the model and dataset, we aim to enable community-driven
research to improve the readability of historical texts and accelerate
scholarship.

Conclusion: 结果表明，战略性地利用以英语为中心的优势可以启动LLM的全面多语言翻译能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong machine translation
capabilities for English-centric language pairs but underperform in direct
non-English (x2x) translation. This work addresses this limitation through a
synthetic data generation framework that leverages models' established
English-to-x (en2x) capabilities. By extending English parallel corpora into
omnidirectional datasets and developing an English-referenced quality
evaluation proxy, we enable effective collection of high-quality x2x training
data. Combined with preference-based optimization, our method achieves
significant improvement across 72 x2x directions for widely used LLMs, while
generalizing to enhance en2x performance. The results demonstrate that
strategic exploitation of English-centric strengths can bootstrap comprehensive
multilingual translation capabilities in LLMs. We release codes, datasets, and

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于强化学习的框架bi-GRPO，用于jailbreak后门攻击，能够有效生成有害内容并保持安全性，显著提高了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在嵌入jailbreak触发器方面存在局限性，包括泛化能力差、隐蔽性受损或生成的jailbreak响应的上下文可用性降低。

Method: bi-GRPO是一种基于强化学习的框架，通过成对的rollouts和成对的奖励，联合优化模型以可靠地生成带有触发器的有害内容并保持其他情况下的安全性。

Result: bi-GRPO在实验中表现出色，实现了超过99%的攻击成功率，同时在非触发场景中保持隐蔽性，并生成高度可用且连贯的jailbreak响应。

Conclusion: bi-GRPO显著提升了jailbreak后门攻击的性能，实现了更高的攻击成功率，并保持了隐蔽性以及生成响应的可用性和连贯性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness
against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has
become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak
triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations
including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual
usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we
propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel
RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By
employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the
model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety
otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by
length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised
datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate),
preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and
coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in
jailbreak backdoor attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自然语言处理和大型语言模型已用于根据文本与特定SDG的相关性进行自动分类，但在许多应用中，确定这种相关性的方向性同样重要，即评估描述的影响是积极、中性还是消极。因此，本文提出了SDG极性检测任务，以解决这一问题。

Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally
recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and
economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP)
and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification
of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in
many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of
this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive,
neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of
SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates
progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such
progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark
dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and
synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six
state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned
configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the
current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly
QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable
Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure),
SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with
synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this
task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in
addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work
advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides
actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity
detection systems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High lexical variation, ambiguous references, and long-range dependencies
make entity resolution in literary texts particularly challenging. We present
Mah\={a}n\={a}ma, the first large-scale dataset for end-to-end Entity Discovery
and Linking (EDL) in Sanskrit, a morphologically rich and under-resourced
language. Derived from the Mah\={a}bh\={a}rata, the world's longest epic, the
dataset comprises over 109K named entity mentions mapped to 5.5K unique
entities, and is aligned with an English knowledge base to support
cross-lingual linking. The complex narrative structure of Mah\={a}n\={a}ma,
coupled with extensive name variation and ambiguity, poses significant
challenges to resolution systems. Our evaluation reveals that current
coreference and entity linking models struggle when evaluated on the global
context of the test set. These results highlight the limitations of current
approaches in resolving entities within such complex discourse. Mah\=an\=ama
thus provides a unique benchmark for advancing entity resolution, especially in
literary domains.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了gaslighting攻击，这是一种旨在评估语音LLM脆弱性的精心设计的提示。通过五种操纵策略测试模型的鲁棒性，并发现语音LLM在面对这些攻击时表现出显著的行为脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音大语言模型（Speech LLMs）越来越多地融入基于语音的应用程序，确保它们对操控或对抗性输入的鲁棒性变得至关重要。

Method: 我们构造了五种操纵策略：愤怒、认知干扰、讽刺、隐含和专业否定，以测试模型在各种任务中的鲁棒性。此外，还进行了声学扰动实验以评估多模态鲁棒性。

Result: 在5个语音和多模态LLM上对超过10,000个测试样本进行综合评估显示，在五种gaslighting攻击下平均准确率下降了24.3%，表明存在显著的行为脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了需要更稳健和可信赖的语音基础AI系统。

Abstract: As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative
or adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied
adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique
cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain
underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and
perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect.
In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts
designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to
evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five
manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and
Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks.
It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and
behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose
different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation
experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model
vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on
over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy
drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant
behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient
and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文描述了SINAI-UJA团队参与eRisk@CLEF 2025实验室的情况，重点解决了两个任务：抑郁症早期检测和对话式抑郁症检测。通过结合预处理管道和基于transformer的模型，我们在任务2中取得了良好的结果，并在试点任务中获得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在参与eRisk@CLEF 2025实验室，并解决两个提出的任务：(i) 任务2：情境化抑郁症早期检测，以及(ii) 试点任务：通过LLMs进行对话式抑郁症检测。

Method: 对于任务2，我们结合了广泛的预处理管道和多种基于transformer的模型，如RoBERTa Base或MentalRoBERTa Large，以捕捉多用户对话的上下文和序列性质。对于试点任务，我们设计了一套对话策略，与LLM驱动的人格进行互动，专注于在有限的对话回合内最大化信息获取。

Result: 在任务2中，我们的系统根据F1分数排名第八。然而，更深入的分析表明，我们的模型在发出早期预测方面是最快速的，这在现实世界部署场景中是一个关键因素。在试点任务中，我们获得了第一名，所有评估指标（DCHR、ADODL和ASHR）表现最佳。

Conclusion: 我们的研究展示了在心理健康评估中使用LLMs的可行性，并强调了结构化对话设计的重要性。同时，我们指出了早期检测和分类准确性之间的权衡，并提出了未来优化两者的可能性。

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of the SINAI-UJA team in the
eRisk@CLEF 2025 lab. Specifically, we addressed two of the proposed tasks: (i)
Task 2: Contextualized Early Detection of Depression, and (ii) Pilot Task:
Conversational Depression Detection via LLMs. Our approach for Task 2 combines
an extensive preprocessing pipeline with the use of several transformer-based
models, such as RoBERTa Base or MentalRoBERTA Large, to capture the contextual
and sequential nature of multi-user conversations. For the Pilot Task, we
designed a set of conversational strategies to interact with LLM-powered
personas, focusing on maximizing information gain within a limited number of
dialogue turns. In Task 2, our system ranked 8th out of 12 participating teams
based on F1 score. However, a deeper analysis revealed that our models were
among the fastest in issuing early predictions, which is a critical factor in
real-world deployment scenarios. This highlights the trade-off between early
detection and classification accuracy, suggesting potential avenues for
optimizing both jointly in future work. In the Pilot Task, we achieved 1st
place out of 5 teams, obtaining the best overall performance across all
evaluation metrics: DCHR, ADODL and ASHR. Our success in this task demonstrates
the effectiveness of structured conversational design when combined with
powerful language models, reinforcing the feasibility of deploying LLMs in
sensitive mental health assessment contexts.

approximately 5400 hours of raw audio. After segmentation and weak annotation,
nearly 5000 hours of speech were retained, covering the seven major Swiss
German dialect regions alongside Standard German. We describe the corpus
construction methodology, including an automated annotation pipeline, and
provide statistics on dialect distribution, token counts, and segmentation
characteristics. Unlike existing Swiss German speech corpora, which primarily
feature controlled speech, this corpus captures natural, spontaneous

Motivation: LLM-as-Judge框架在AI评估中越来越流行，但关于模型生成和判断能力之间关系的研究结果仍然不一致。

Method: 我们通过跨11个模型和21个多样化任务的系统数据集和实例级分析来研究这种关系。

Result: 尽管这两种能力都依赖于相同的底层知识，但我们的分析显示它们之间只有弱相关性。自参考引导的评估策略显著增强了生成和判断能力之间的相关性。

Conclusion: 我们的分析揭示了生成和判断能力之间只有弱相关性，主要是由于LLM对被评估的响应敏感。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种自参考引导的评估策略，利用模型自己的答案作为参考。这种方法显著增强了生成和判断能力之间的相关性，为对齐这些技能提供了一条实用的路径，并为评估任务中的模型选择提供了可靠的代理。

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge frameworks are increasingly popular for AI evaluation, yet
research findings on the relationship between models' generation and judgment
abilities remain inconsistent. We investigate this relationship through
systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse
tasks. Despite both capabilities relying on the same underlying knowledge, our
analyses reveal they are only weakly correlated, primarily due to LLMs'
sensitivity to the responses being judged. To address this, we propose a
self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that leverages a model's own answers
as references. This approach significantly strengthens the correlation between
generation and judgment abilities, offering a practical path to align these
skills and providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FPA的偏好学习方法，通过在正则化项中使用未来策略来替代当前策略，以解决数学推理中偏好学习方法效果不佳的问题。FPA在多个基准测试中表现出色，且计算开销很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become standard for Large Language Model (LLM) post-training, yet they are often ineffective for mathematical reasoning. A key challenge is the large token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse.

Method: Future Policy Aware (FPA) preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight, logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model.

Result: FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%.

Conclusion: FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the probability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer, degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have
become standard for Large Language Model (LLM) post-training, yet they are
often ineffective for mathematical reasoning. A key challenge is the large
token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the
probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared
useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse.
As a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory
under the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect
of the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect
takes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has
begun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA)
preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in
the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight,
logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA
enables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic
gradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH
and GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest
improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We
demonstrate that FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the
probability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer,
degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead. We will
release our code publicly upon publication.

Abstract: In this paper, we present WEST(WE Speech Toolkit), a speech toolkit based on
a large language model (LLM) for speech understanding, generation, and
interaction. There are three key features of WEST: 1) Fully LLM-based: Standing
on the shoulders of giants by reusing mature architectures, ecosystems (e.g.,
Hugging Face), and methods (e.g., sequence packing) from large models. 2)
Full-stack: Supports tasks such as recognition, synthesis, understanding,
dialogue, and multimodal capabilities, with extensibility to incorporate
open-source models. 3) Simple and Stupid: A simple and stupid speech toolkit
that everyone can Touch. In addition, WEST provides two types of recipes,
models, and experimental results. The first is entirely based on open-source
models and open-source data, allowing users to fully reproduce the experiments
in this paper and serving as a verification system or minimal system baseline.
The second is trained on massive data, offering superior performance so the
user can directly apply it out of the box. WEST is publicly avilable at

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个涵盖11种印度语言的大规模高质量平行语料库CorIL，并展示了其在机器翻译研究中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在多语言神经机器翻译（NMT）方面取得了进展，但高质量的平行语料库对于印度语言仍然稀缺，尤其是在不同领域中。因此，本文旨在创建一个大规模、高质量的平行语料库，以改善这一状况。

Method: 本文介绍了大规模、高质量的平行语料库CorIL，涵盖了11种印度语言，并将其系统地分类为三个关键领域：政府、健康和通用，以支持领域感知的机器翻译研究和促进有效的领域适应。此外，还微调和评估了几种最先进的NMT模型，如IndicTrans2、NLLB和BhashaVerse。

Result: 分析揭示了重要的性能趋势，并突显了该语料库在探测模型能力方面的价值。例如，结果表明，基于语言脚本的性能模式存在差异，而大规模多语言模型在Perso-Arabic脚本（如乌尔都语、信德语）上表现出优势，其他模型则在印欧脚本上表现更佳。

Conclusion: 本文通过公开CorIL数据集，旨在显著提高印度语言高质量训练数据的可用性，并为机器翻译研究社区提供有价值的资源。

Abstract: India's linguistic landscape is one of the most diverse in the world,
comprising over 120 major languages and approximately 1,600 additional
languages, with 22 officially recognized as scheduled languages in the Indian
Constitution. Despite recent progress in multilingual neural machine
translation (NMT), high-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain
scarce, especially across varied domains. In this paper, we introduce a
large-scale, high-quality annotated parallel corpus covering 11 of these
languages : English, Telugu, Hindi, Punjabi, Odia, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Dogri,
Kannada, Urdu, and Gujarati comprising a total of 772,000 bi-text sentence
pairs. The dataset is carefully curated and systematically categorized into
three key domains: Government, Health, and General, to enable domain-aware
machine translation research and facilitate effective domain adaptation. To
demonstrate the utility of CorIL and establish strong benchmarks for future
research, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art NMT models,
including IndicTrans2, NLLB, and BhashaVerse. Our analysis reveals important
performance trends and highlights the corpus's value in probing model
capabilities. For instance, the results show distinct performance patterns
based on language script, with massively multilingual models showing an
advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excel on
Indic scripts. This paper provides a detailed domain-wise performance analysis,
offering insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning.
By publicly releasing CorIL, we aim to significantly improve the availability
of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable
resource for the machine translation research community.

Motivation: 文章旨在揭示大型语言模型在对话行为中未能有效利用其知识的根本性问题，并探讨这一问题对模型表现和伦理的影响。

Method: 文章通过分析大型语言模型的训练方法和对话行为之间的关系，探讨了知识与行为之间的断开现象，并讨论了伦理层面的断开问题。

Result: 文章发现，大型语言模型的训练方法导致了知识与行为之间的断开，这种断开是根本性的，无法通过更多数据或训练来解决。此外，现有的伦理技术可能加剧这一问题。

Conclusion: 文章指出，大型语言模型在对话行为中未能有效利用其知识，这种'断开'是根本性的，无法通过更多数据或训练来解决。此外，伦理层面的断开问题也未被现有技术解决，甚至可能被加剧。

Abstract: Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT)
give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are
correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge
to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own
conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to
this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental
in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a
conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I
will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the
establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a
fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of
hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the
disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical
conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with
several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will
discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it
worse.

TL;DR: DiffNator是一个用于解释两个时间序列之间差异的框架，通过设计JSON模式并利用TORI数据集训练模型，能够生成准确的解释，并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多物联网应用中，中心兴趣不在于单个传感器信号，而在于它们的差异，但解释这些差异需要专业知识。

Method: 设计了一个JSON模式来捕获此类差异的本质属性，并使用时间序列观察现实世界物联网（TORI）数据集生成配对序列，训练一个结合时间序列编码器和冻结大语言模型的模型以输出JSON格式的解释。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiffNator能够生成准确的差异解释，并显著优于视觉问答（VQA）基线和使用预训练时间序列编码器的检索方法。

Conclusion: DiffNator生成准确的差异解释，并显著优于视觉问答（VQA）基线和使用预训练时间序列编码器的检索方法。

Abstract: In many IoT applications, the central interest lies not in individual sensor
signals but in their differences, yet interpreting such differences requires
expert knowledge. We propose DiffNator, a framework for structured explanations
of differences between two time series. We first design a JSON schema that
captures the essential properties of such differences. Using the Time-series
Observations of Real-world IoT (TORI) dataset, we generate paired sequences and
train a model that combine a time-series encoder with a frozen LLM to output
JSON-formatted explanations. Experimental results show that DiffNator generates
accurate difference explanations and substantially outperforms both a visual
question answering (VQA) baseline and a retrieval method using a pre-trained
time-series encoder.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在直接探讨影响模型性能的因素，特别是代表偏差对模型性能的影响。

Method: 本研究通过比较最先进的解码器-only LLMs和基于编码器的模型，在三个任务中分析了TP和IP与下游性能的关系，同时控制脚本和资源可用性的变化。

Result: 研究结果表明，TP是依赖句法和形态线索的任务（如提取式问答）的更好预测因素，而IP是语义任务（如主题分类）的更好预测因素。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了TP和IP在不同任务中的预测能力，指出语言模型的声称的语言支持可能掩盖了更深层次的脚本或标记级别的不匹配。

Abstract: Dialectal data are characterized by linguistic variation that appears small
to humans but has a significant impact on the performance of models. This
dialect gap has been related to various factors (e.g., data size, economic and
social factors) whose impact, however, turns out to be inconsistent. In this
work, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we
correlate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of
representational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream
performance. We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based
models across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and
extractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs.
non-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that
TP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and
morphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance
in semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Complementary analyses,
including tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights,
reveal that the language support claims of LLMs often might mask deeper
mismatches at the script or token level.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于 token 级似然特征的输入方法，用于预测语言模型在处理习语、隐喻或上下文敏感输入时的失败，该方法在多个数据集上表现优于标准基线，并且无需访问输出或隐藏激活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在处理习语、隐喻或上下文敏感输入时经常遇到困难，不是因为它们产生错误的输出，而是因为从一开始就误解了输入。

Method: 我们提出了一种仅输入的方法，使用受 surprisal 和 Uniform Information Density 假设启发的 token 级似然特征来预测此类失败。

Result: 这些特征捕捉了输入理解中的局部不确定性，并在五个语言挑战数据集中优于标准基线。我们展示了局部化特征可以提高大型模型的错误检测能力，而小型模型则受益于全局模式。

Conclusion: 我们的方法提供了一种轻量且可推广的预生成错误预测方法，无需访问输出或隐藏激活。

Abstract: Language models often struggle with idiomatic, figurative, or
context-sensitive inputs, not because they produce flawed outputs, but because
they misinterpret the input from the outset. We propose an input-only method
for anticipating such failures using token-level likelihood features inspired
by surprisal and the Uniform Information Density hypothesis. These features
capture localized uncertainty in input comprehension and outperform standard
baselines across five linguistically challenging datasets. We show that
span-localized features improve error detection for larger models, while
smaller models benefit from global patterns. Our method requires no access to
outputs or hidden activations, offering a lightweight and generalizable
approach to pre-generation error prediction.

Motivation: 现有的多模态模型在处理交错的音频和文本时需要复杂的多阶段训练流程，计算成本高，并且对文本和音频标记都统一应用自回归生成，忽略了它们依赖结构的根本不对称性。

Method: 本文提出了一种统一的音频-文本建模框架TtT，将AR文本生成与非自回归音频扩散整合到一个Transformer架构中，该架构从预训练的LLM初始化。

Conclusion: 本文提出了TtT，一个统一的音频-文本建模框架，将AR文本生成与非自回归音频扩散整合到一个Transformer架构中，该架构从预训练的LLM初始化。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have attracted significant interest
in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly for
speech-in speech-out conversational systems. However, existing multimodal
models handling interleaved audio and text, such as MOSHI require complex multi
stage training pipelines, incurring substantial computational costs. Moreover,
these models uniformly apply autoregressive generation to both text and audio
tokens, overlooking a fundamental asymmetry in their dependency structures:
while text tokens exhibit strong target target dependencies requiring causal
ordering, audio tokens are predominantly driven by source target dependencies,
where audio outputs primarily condition on source text rather than preceding
audio tokens. In this work, we propose TtT, a unified audio-text modeling
framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive audio
diffusion within a single Transformer architecture initialized from a
pretrained LLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列到序列模型在组合性和系统泛化方面存在局限，尽管它们在许多其他任务中表现出色。我们将其归因于它们未能内化常规化的形式-意义配对，这些配对允许生产性重组。

Method: 我们引入了一种无监督的过程来挖掘伪构造：从训练数据中自动提取的变量槽模板。

Result: 当应用于SCAN数据集时，我们的方法在分布外分割上取得了显著提升：在ADD JUMP上的准确率上升到47.8%，在AROUND RIGHT上上升到20.3%。模型还达到了与原始训练数据的40%相当的竞争力表现，展示了强大的数据效率。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，构造意识的预处理可以作为替代重型架构或训练制度干预的有前途的方法。

Abstract: Sequence to Sequence models struggle at compositionality and systematic
generalisation even while they excel at many other tasks. We attribute this
limitation to their failure to internalise constructions conventionalised form
meaning pairings that license productive recombination. Building on these
insights, we introduce an unsupervised procedure for mining
pseudo-constructions: variable-slot templates automatically extracted from

AROUND RIGHT without any architectural changes or additional supervision. The
model also attains competitive performance with? 40% of the original training

Motivation: 传统方法在处理名称、外来词、缩写和同形异义词时存在困难，因此需要一种更准确的音素化方法。

Method: OLaPh结合了大型词典、多种自然语言处理技术和复合词解析与概率评分函数。此外，还训练了一个大型语言模型来进一步解决未解决的情况。

Result: 在德语和英语中的评估显示，OLaPh框架和大型语言模型在挑战性数据集上均取得了比之前方法更好的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了OLaPh框架和一个大型语言模型，以提高语音合成中的音素化准确性，并提供了免费的资源供未来研究使用。

Abstract: Phonemization, the conversion of text into phonemes, is a key step in
text-to-speech. Traditional approaches use rule-based transformations and
lexicon lookups, while more advanced methods apply preprocessing techniques or
neural networks for improved accuracy on out-of-domain vocabulary. However, all
systems struggle with names, loanwords, abbreviations, and homographs. This
work presents OLaPh (Optimal Language Phonemizer), a framework that combines
large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a
probabilistic scoring function. Evaluations in German and English show improved
accuracy over previous approaches, including on a challenging dataset. To
further address unresolved cases, we train a large language model on
OLaPh-generated data, which achieves even stronger generalization and
performance. Together, the framework and LLM improve phonemization consistency
and provide a freely available resource for future research.

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLM在因果理解上的失败不是因为预训练接触不足，而是因为缺乏结构化的因果表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的研究显示，LLM在因果关系分类中达到接近随机的准确性，这引发了关于这些失败是由于有限的预训练接触还是更深层次的表示差距的问题。

Method: 通过基于不确定性的评估来测试预训练接触因果例子是否能提高因果理解，分析模型行为包括因果分类和逐字记忆探测。

Result: 模型在已见/未见句子上的准确性几乎相同（p > 0.05），没有记忆偏差（24.8%选择原始句子），输出分布接近平坦，熵值接近最大值，确认了随机猜测。指令调优模型表现出严重的校准错误。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，因果理解的失败是由于缺乏结构化的因果表示，而不是预训练期间对因果例子的暴露不足。

Abstract: Recent papers show LLMs achieve near-random accuracy in causal relation
classification, raising questions about whether such failures arise from
limited pretraining exposure or deeper representational gaps. We investigate
this under uncertainty-based evaluation, testing whether pretraining exposure
to causal examples improves causal understanding >18K PubMed sentences -- half
from The Pile corpus, half post-2024 -- across seven models
(Pythia-1.4B/7B/12B, GPT-J-6B, Dolly-7B/12B, Qwen-7B). We analyze model
behavior through: (i) causal classification, where the model identifies causal
relationships in text, and (ii) verbatim memorization probing, where we assess
whether the model prefers previously seen causal statements over their
paraphrases. Models perform four-way classification
(direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and select between originals
and their generated paraphrases. Results show almost identical accuracy on
seen/unseen sentences (p > 0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original
selection), and output distribution over the possible options is almost flat,
with entropic values near the maximum (1.35/1.39), confirming random guessing.
Instruction-tuned models show severe miscalibration (Qwen: > 95% confidence,
32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49). Conditional relations induce highest entropy (+11%
vs. direct). These findings suggest that failures in causal understanding arise
from the lack of structured causal representation, rather than insufficient
exposure to causal examples during pretraining.

Motivation: 传统基于基准的评估方法依赖于固定的参考答案，限制了其捕捉生成响应的重要定性方面的能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为SPEED的集成评估框架，利用专门的功能专家对模型输出进行综合、描述性的分析，并主动结合专家反馈，涵盖幻觉检测、毒性评估和词法-语境适当性等多个维度。

Result: 实验结果表明，SPEED在不同领域和数据集上实现了稳健且一致的评估性能，并且相比更大规模的评估者，表现出更高的资源效率。

Conclusion: SPEED显著提高了LLM评估中的公平性和可解释性，为现有的评估方法提供了一个有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their
applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation
methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to
capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these
shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called
\textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics},
SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive,
descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED
actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including
hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual
appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust
and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets.
Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates
superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These
findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and
interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to
existing evaluation methodologies.

Motivation: 语言特征数据集如URIEL+对于建模跨语言关系很有价值，但高维性和稀疏性（尤其是对于低资源语言）限制了距离度量的有效性。

Method: 通过结合特征选择和插补优化URIEL+类型特征空间，生成紧凑且可解释的类型表示。

Conclusion: 减少规模的语言类型表示可以产生更有信息量的距离度量，并提高多语言NLP应用的性能。

Abstract: Linguistic feature datasets such as URIEL+ are valuable for modelling
cross-lingual relationships, but their high dimensionality and sparsity,
especially for low-resource languages, limit the effectiveness of distance
metrics. We propose a pipeline to optimize the URIEL+ typological feature space
by combining feature selection and imputation, producing compact yet
interpretable typological representations. We evaluate these feature subsets on
linguistic distance alignment and downstream tasks, demonstrating that
reduced-size representations of language typology can yield more informative
distance metrics and improve performance in multilingual NLP applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在特定领域任务上的表现有限，因为其训练数据中专业化信息的自然不平衡表示以及这些数据集的静态性质。知识稀缺性和时间滞后导致了领域应用的知识差距。

Method: 我们提出了基于增强生成的强化学习（RLAG），该方法通过计算奖励来优化模型，有效地嵌入关键且上下文连贯的领域知识。

Result: 我们的方法在医学、法律、天文学和时事数据集上的实验结果表明，它显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在医学、法律、天文学和时事数据集上的实验结果表明，它显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on
domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of
specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these
datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain
applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into
models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT)
treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to
prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures
necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach
iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model
through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually
coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log
probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward
metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain
expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations
generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across
medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our
proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. Our code and
data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.

Motivation: 由于多语言大型语言模型在全球范围内的广泛应用，确保它们没有性别偏见以防止代表性伤害变得至关重要。然而，低资源语言的研究仍不足。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于模板的探测方法，并引入了领域特定性别偏差指数（DS-GSI），以量化性别均等的偏差。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了在低资源语言中进行包容性自然语言处理实践的必要性，并提供了一个评估其他低资源语言中偏见的框架。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used worldwide,
making it essential to ensure they are free from gender bias to prevent
representational harm. While prior studies have examined such biases in
high-resource languages, low-resource languages remain understudied. In this
paper, we propose a template-based probing methodology, validated against
real-world data, to uncover gender stereotypes in LLMs. As part of this
framework, we introduce the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI), a
metric that quantifies deviations from gender parity. We evaluate four
prominent models, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B,
across four semantic domains, focusing on Persian, a low-resource language with
distinct linguistic features. Our results show that all models exhibit gender
stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than in English across all
domains. Among these, sports reflect the most rigid gender biases. This study
underscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for
assessing bias in other low-resource languages.

*Liang Wang,Nan Yang,Shaohan Huang,Li Dong,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT)的方法，通过增强文本数据的思维轨迹来提高大型语言模型训练的数据效率。实验结果表明，该方法在各种模型大小和家族中显著提高了LLM的性能，特别是在数据效率方面提升了3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练LLM的计算需求快速增长，而高质量数据的可用性仍然有限，因此最大化可用数据的效用成为重要的研究挑战。某些高质量的标记由于其背后的逻辑复杂，难以在固定模型容量下学习。

Method: 本文提出了Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT)方法，通过自动生成的思维轨迹增强文本数据，从而增加训练数据量并使高质量的标记更容易学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，TPT方法在各种模型大小和家族中显著提高了LLM的性能。对于一个3B参数的模型，它在几个具有挑战性的推理基准上提高了超过10%的后训练性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种简单且可扩展的方法，通过增强现有文本数据的思维轨迹来提高大型语言模型（LLM）训练的数据效率。实验结果表明，该方法在各种模型大小和家族中显著提高了LLM的性能，特别是在数据效率方面提升了3倍。

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data
efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text
data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been
growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data
remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data
constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that
certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model
capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally
complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented
Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with
automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively
increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more
learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across
diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training
with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong
open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method
substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and
families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a
factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training
performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何将LLM功能集成到声明式查询语言中，并提出了一种高效的方法来确保类型正确性，从而提高了性能和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法通过许多LLM-based后处理调用来确保生成的输出与数据库值对齐，这引入了性能瓶颈。本文旨在解决这一问题，提高效率和准确性。

Method: 本文研究了不同大小的开源语言模型在解析和执行基于SQL的查询语言中的函数的能力，并提出了一种高效的方法来确保LLM函数的类型正确性。

Result: 小型语言模型可以在混合数据源上作为函数执行器表现出色，并且提出的解决方案在多跳问答数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效的方法来确保LLM函数的类型正确性，并在多跳问答数据集上展示了7%的准确率提升和53%的延迟改进。

Abstract: Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for
the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful,
generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the
optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs
must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents.
Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of
many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated
outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a
study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse
and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small
language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then,
we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM
functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question
answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions. We
make our implementation available at https://github.com/parkervg/blendsql

Abstract: Despite advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), low-resource languages
like Tigrinya remain underserved due to persistent challenges, including
limited corpora, inadequate tokenization strategies, and the lack of
standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper investigates transfer learning
techniques using multilingual pretrained models to enhance translation quality
for morphologically rich, low-resource languages. We propose a refined approach
that integrates language-specific tokenization, informed embedding
initialization, and domain-adaptive fine-tuning. To enable rigorous assessment,
we construct a high-quality, human-aligned English-Tigrinya evaluation dataset
covering diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that transfer
learning with a custom tokenizer substantially outperforms zero-shot baselines,
with gains validated by BLEU, chrF, and qualitative human evaluation.
Bonferroni correction is applied to ensure statistical significance across
configurations. Error analysis reveals key limitations and informs targeted
refinements. This study underscores the importance of linguistically aware
modeling and reproducible benchmarks in bridging the performance gap for
underrepresented languages. Resources are available at

TL;DR: 我们的研究探讨了通过微调策略改进语言模型对回声和填充词的表示能力，并发现微调有助于模型生成更像人类的对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回声和填充词在对话中很重要，但在现代基于变压器的语言模型中表现不足。因此，我们需要研究如何通过微调来改善这一点。

Method: 我们使用三种微调策略，在英语和日语的对话语料库上训练模型，以研究微调如何帮助语言模型学习回声和填充词的表示。

Result: 我们发现微调后的模型在回声和填充词的表示上具有更高的轮廓分数，并且生成的语句更接近人类生产的语句。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，通过微调可以将通用语言模型转化为更能够生成类似人类语言的对话语言模型。

Abstract: Backchannels and fillers are important linguistic expressions in dialogue,
but are under-represented in modern transformer-based language models (LMs).
Our work studies the representation of them in language models using three
fine-tuning strategies. The models are trained on three dialogue corpora in
English and Japanese, where backchannels and fillers are preserved and
annotated, to investigate how fine-tuning can help LMs learn their
representations. We first apply clustering analysis to the learnt
representation of backchannels and fillers, and have found increased silhouette
scores in representations from fine-tuned models, which suggests that
fine-tuning enables LMs to distinguish the nuanced semantic variation in
different backchannel and filler use. We also use natural language generation
(NLG) metrics to confirm that the utterances generated by fine-tuned language
models resemble human-produced utterances more closely. Our findings suggest
the potentials of transforming general LMs into conversational LMs that are
more capable of producing human-like languages adequately.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型在提示设计方面的局限性，提出了一个测量偏差的框架，并指出需要改进模型的可靠性和用户提示的设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在解决问题方面表现出强大的能力，但它们的局限性，特别是由于提示设计而产生的问题，仍未得到充分研究。用户可能提供有偏见或不完整的提示，这可能导致模型被误导，从而影响其可靠性并带来风险。

Method: 我们将问题归纳为八个具体的方面，并引入了BiasDetector框架，该框架测量来自三种指令类型的偏差：完整、冗余和不足。

Result: 我们评估了几种主流的LLM，并发现尽管总体准确率很高，但在许多下游任务中，由于提示覆盖范围的问题，仍然存在显著的偏差。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了开发人员解决偏差的必要性，以及用户在精心设计提示时的重要性。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) reasoning has long been regarded as a powerful
tool for problem solving across domains, providing non-experts with valuable
advice. However, their limitations - especially those stemming from prompt
design - remain underexplored. Because users may supply biased or incomplete
prompts - often unintentionally - LLMs can be misled, undermining reliability
and creating risks. We refer to this vulnerability as the Instruction Boundary.
To investigate the phenomenon, we distill it into eight concrete facets and
introduce BiasDetector, a framework that measures biases arising from three
instruction types: complete, redundant, and insufficient. We evaluate several
mainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial
biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt
coverage. Our empirical study confirms that LLM reasoning reliability can still
be significantly improved. We analyze the practical impact of these biases and
outline mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the need for developers
to tackle biases and for users to craft options carefully.

Motivation: 我们调查了机器翻译中充分性和流畅性之间的权衡，并分析了流行指标在其中的位置。

Method: 我们提出了一种在元评估中合成翻译系统的方法，以控制这种偏差。

Result: 我们发现当前的指标通常倾向于充分性，这意味着它们的分数与翻译的充分性相关性更强，而不是与流畅性相关。此外，我们发现这种权衡在元评估层面也存在，并且标准的WMT元评估偏向于充分性导向的指标。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了在元评估中理解这种权衡的重要性及其对指标排名的影响。

Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine
translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and
analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics
generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more
strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly,
we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that
the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over
fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the
composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control
this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in
meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this
tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.

Furthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SIM-CoT的训练模块，通过引入步骤级监督来稳定和丰富隐式推理空间。该方法在保持隐式CoT计算效率的同时，显著提升了各种隐式CoT方法的域内准确性和域外稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods present a promising, token-efficient alternative to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but a persistent performance gap has limited the application of implicit CoT. We identify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of implicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens to enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and collapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent representations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a failure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT approaches.

Method: We propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit reasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful information. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference, preserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added overhead.

Result: SIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain stability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by +8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. Demonstrating strong scalability, SIM-CoT also surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1% with 2.3	imes greater token efficiency, while substantially closing the performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B.

TL;DR: 本文提出Z-Scores作为跨度级评估指标，用于更细致地分析语音中失衡移除的效果，揭示传统词级指标无法发现的模型弱点。


<details>

Motivation: 传统基于单词的指标如精确度、召回率和F1分数（E分数）虽然能捕捉整体性能，但无法揭示模型成功或失败的原因。需要一种更细致的评估方法来识别模型的失败模式。

Method: 引入Z-Scores，这是一种基于语言学的跨度级评估指标，能够分类系统行为在不同类型的失衡（如EDITED、INTJ、PRN）中的表现。同时，使用确定性对齐模块来实现生成文本与失衡转录本之间的稳健映射。

Result: Z-Scores能够暴露传统词级指标掩盖的系统性弱点，并通过案例研究显示其在LLM上的有效性，揭示了隐藏在聚合F1中的INTJ和PRN失衡挑战。

Conclusion: Z-Scores能够揭示传统词级指标无法显示的模型系统性弱点，并通过提供特定类别诊断帮助研究人员设计针对性干预措施，从而提高性能。

Abstract: Evaluating disfluency removal in speech requires more than aggregate
token-level scores. Traditional word-based metrics such as precision, recall,
and F1 (E-Scores) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models
succeed or fail. We introduce Z-Scores, a span-level linguistically-grounded
evaluation metric that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency
types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN). Our deterministic alignment module enables robust
mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to
expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing
category-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model
failure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or
data augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study
with LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies
hidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.

Result: Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities.

Conclusion: EmbeddingGemma 是一个轻量级、开放的文本嵌入模型，具有出色的性能和成本效益，适用于低延迟和高吞吐量的应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model
based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe
strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder
initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model
robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure
generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.
Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,
English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art
results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,
with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models
double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,
this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding
outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and
high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation
studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the
community to promote further research.

Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法在可验证领域有效，但在开放任务中表现有限。本文旨在探索RLVR在更广泛任务中的有效性，并提升通用聊天能力。

Method: 本文引入了RLMT（基于模型奖励的思维强化学习）方法，通过在线RL优化生成的长思维链，使用基于偏好的奖励模型进行优化。

Result: RLMT在多个基准测试中表现优于标准RLHF管道，包括AlpacaEval2、WildBench和ArenaHardV2等。此外，RLMT还能直接应用于基础模型，无需SFT阶段。

Conclusion: 本文重新思考了后训练流程，并呼吁未来的工作更广泛地理解和应用思考。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves language model
reasoning by using rule-based rewards in verifiable domains such as mathematics
and code. However, RLVR leads to limited generalization for open-ended tasks --
such as writing outline essays or making meal plans -- where humans reason
routinely. This paper shows that the RLVR paradigm is effective beyond
verifiable domains, and introduces **RL** with **M**odel-rewarded **T**hinking
(**RLMT**) for general-purpose chat capabilities. Using diverse real-world
prompts, RLMT requires LMs to generate long CoT reasoning before response, and
optimizes them with online RL against a preference-based reward model used in
RLHF. Across 40 training runs on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B (both base and
instruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT
consistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines. This includes substantial
gains of 3-7 points on three chat benchmarks (AlpacaEval2, WildBench, and
ArenaHardV2), along with 1-3 point improvements on other tasks like creative
writing and general knowledge. Our best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat and
creative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Thinking). RLMT can also be
applied directly to base models without an SFT stage, akin to R1-Zero training.
Remarkably, with only 7K prompts, Llama-3.1-8B base trained with our RLMT
recipe outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct post-trained with a complex
multi-staged pipeline with 25M+ examples. We close with qualitative and
quantitative analyses of how trained models plan their responses. Our results
rethink the post-training pipeline and call upon future work to understand and
employ thinking more broadly.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于主动学习的方法，用于减少对象检测任务中的标注成本，并通过结合多样性策略提高了模型的泛化能力。在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在相同标注预算下实现了更高的mAP分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效的数据标注仍然是机器学习中的关键挑战，特别是在需要大量标记数据的对象检测任务中。主动学习（AL）被提出作为减少标注成本的有希望的解决方案。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于主动学习的方法，通过选择最具信息量的样本来减少标注成本，并结合了多样性策略以提高模型的泛化能力。

Result: 我们在两个基准数据集（TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word）上评估了我们的方法，使用了最先进的表格检测架构，如CascadeTabNet和YOLOv9。结果表明，基于AL的例子选择显著优于随机采样，在有限的预算下保持与完全监督模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在相同的标注预算下实现了更高的mAP分数，证明了基于主动学习的例子选择在表格检测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

TL;DR: ReflectDrive is a new framework for autonomous driving that uses a reflection mechanism to generate safe trajectories without gradient computation, showing strong performance in safety-critical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for autonomous driving systems face limitations in encoding physical rules during training, relying on complex rule-based post-refinement, simulation-limited reinforcement learning, or computationally expensive diffusion guidance. ReflectDrive aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel framework for safe trajectory generation.

Method: ReflectDrive is a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. It discretizes the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. A safety-aware reflection mechanism performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation.

Result: Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive shows significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, providing a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for
autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge
from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex
real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the
limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode
physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex
rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely
limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires
computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,
we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a
reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We
first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action
codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for
planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware
reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient
computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to
model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search
methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then
serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the
NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in
safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable
solution for autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 现有的并行预测方法在效率和保真度之间存在权衡，需要更有效的解码策略来提高语音生成模型的性能。

Method: 本文研究了基于自回归Transformer和基于MaskGIT的Transformer两种LT架构，并进一步引入了帧堆叠技术。

Result: 通过广泛的分析，本文揭示了并行和迭代采样策略在不同吞吐量和质量范围内的权衡，并提出了改进速度而不牺牲感知质量的帧堆叠技术。

Conclusion: 本文系统地研究了两种LT架构，并提出了根据部署优先级选择解码策略的实用指南。

Abstract: Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically
operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens
due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N
codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple
parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among
codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced
fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer
(LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this
work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive
transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based
transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further
enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames
jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed
without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we
characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies
across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical
guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities
such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.

Motivation: 开放源代码的多模态大语言模型仍然落后于最先进的文本型大语言模型，限制了它们在语音摘要中的实际部署。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的多阶段强化学习训练框架，以增强多模态大语言模型的语音摘要能力。

Result: 我们的模型在强基线中表现优异，超过了更大的多模态大语言模型，并显著缩小了与最先进的文本型大语言模型之间的差距。

Conclusion: 我们的模型在多模态大语言模型的语音摘要能力上取得了显著提升，大大缩小了与最先进的文本型大语言模型之间的差距。

Abstract: Speech summarization is a critical component of spoken content understanding,
particularly in the era of rapidly growing spoken and audiovisual data. Recent
advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), leveraging the power of
LLMs, enable generating textual summaries directly from speech without
intermediate transcriptions, while supporting controllable styles and zero-shot
generalization. However, open-source MLLMs continue to lag behind the
state-of-the-art text-based LLMs, limiting their practical deployment for
speech summarization. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage
reinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization
capabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong
baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap
with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究揭示了认知负荷对大型语言模型推理失败的影响，并提出了动态压力测试的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示大型语言模型在静态基准测试中的表现与其在动态、信息丰富的环境中的脆弱性之间的关键差距。

Method: 引入了计算认知负荷的正式理论，并设计了Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE)基准测试，以系统地操纵这些负荷因素。

Result: 较小的开源架构（如Llama-3-8B-Instruct和Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2）在所有条件下均表现出0%的准确性，而Gemini-2.0-Flash-001在控制条件下表现出部分弹性。

Conclusion: 动态的、认知意识的压力测试，如ICE基准测试，对于评估先进AI系统的真正弹性与安全性是必不可少的。

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了UserRL框架，用于训练和评估以用户为中心的代理模型。实验显示奖励塑造和用户模拟选择的重要性，并展示了开源模拟器的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户辅助的环境中，用户交互的多样性和动态性带来了挑战。因此，需要一种统一的框架来训练和评估以用户为中心的能力。

Method: 我们提出了UserRL，这是一个统一的框架，通过标准化的gym环境和模拟用户来训练和评估以用户为中心的能力。我们系统地改变回合级奖励分配和轨迹级分数计算，以分析不同公式如何影响GRPO算法下的学习。

Result: 我们的实验揭示了三个关键发现：(i) SFT冷启动对于解锁初始交互能力并实现持续的RL改进至关重要；(ii) 故意的轨迹评分可以更高效和有效地进行多轮交互；(iii) 虽然更强的模拟用户（例如GPT-4o）有助于训练，但开源模拟器（例如Qwen3-32B）仍然是成本效益高且可转移的选择。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，奖励塑造和用户模拟选择的设计与模型规模一样重要，并确立了UserRL作为开发强大以用户为中心的代理模型的实际途径。所有代码和数据都是公开的，供未来研究使用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future
research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.

Method: FoA引入了版本化能力向量（VCVs），利用语义嵌入使代理能力可搜索，并结合语义路由、动态任务分解和智能聚类三种创新方法。

Result: 在HealthBench上的评估显示，与单模型基线相比有13倍的改进，特别是在需要多视角的复杂推理任务中，聚类增强的合作特别有效。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了语义编排和结构化协作如何释放异构AI代理联邦的集体智能。

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective
intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

Motivation: 管理CT扫描协议需要临床和技术专业知识，而放射学领域正面临熟练劳动力短缺的问题。因此，需要一种能够提高工作效率并减轻技术人员负担的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理框架，结合了上下文学习、指令遵循和结构化工具调用能力，以识别相关的协议元素并应用准确的修改。

Result: 实验结果表明，该代理可以有效地检索协议组件，生成设备兼容的协议定义文件，并忠实执行用户请求。

Conclusion: 研究显示，基于大型语言模型的代理在CT扫描协议管理中具有明确的发展路径，但仍面临语法和语义有效性方面的限制以及模糊或复杂请求的挑战。

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.

Abstract: Community engagement processes in representative political contexts, like
school districts, generate massive volumes of feedback that overwhelm
traditional synthesis methods, creating barriers to shared understanding not
only between civic leaders and constituents but also among community members.
To address these barriers, we developed StoryBuilder, a human-AI collaborative
pipeline that transforms community input into accessible first-person
narratives. Using 2,480 community responses from an ongoing school rezoning
process, we generated 124 composite stories and deployed them through a
mobile-friendly StorySharer interface. Our mixed-methods evaluation combined a
four-month field deployment, user studies with 21 community members, and a
controlled experiment examining how narrative composition affects participant
reactions. Field results demonstrate that narratives helped community members
relate across diverse perspectives. In the experiment, experience-grounded
narratives generated greater respect and trust than opinion-heavy narratives.
We contribute a human-AI narrative synthesis system and insights on its varied
acceptance and effectiveness in a real-world civic context.

Abstract: Text and time series data offer complementary views of financial markets:
news articles provide narrative context about company events, while stock
prices reflect how markets react to those events. However, despite their
complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for
improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified
neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using
modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series
patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving
pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal
understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient
token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across
modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal

insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our
cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these

Motivation: 现有基于rollout的强化学习方法未能明确考虑LLMs对不同难度样本的学习能力，这与人类从简单到复杂的数学推理认知过程相悖。

Method: 提出了一种基于组奖励方差动态控制训练样本难度的课程强化学习框架VCRL。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试和两个模型上的实验表明，VCRL优于当前的LLM RL基线。

Conclusion: VCRL展示了在数学基准测试中优于当前LLM RL基线的优势。

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

### [96] [PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19894)
*Xueliang Zhao,Wei Wu,Jian Guan,Zhuocheng Gong,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptCoT 2.0是一种可扩展的框架，通过迭代优化推理来生成更难和更多样的问题。它在自我博弈和监督微调中表现出色，超越了基于人类数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型正在从对话系统演变为解决奥数数学和竞赛编程等任务的强推理器。然而，高质量训练问题的缺乏是主要瓶颈：人工策划的数据集成本高且有限，而现有的合成语料库通常太简单或太狭窄。

Method: PromptCoT 2.0是一个可扩展的框架，它用期望最大化（EM）循环取代了手工制作的启发式方法，其中推理被迭代优化以指导提示构建。

Result: PromptCoT 2.0生成的问题比以前的语料库更难且更多样化。合成提示支持两种后续训练制度：(1) 自我博弈，其中强大的模型通过可验证的反馈自主改进；(2) 监督微调（SFT），其中较弱的模型从教师提炼的轨迹中学习。

Conclusion: 这些结果确立了提示合成作为扩展推理的新轴线，并将PromptCoT 2.0定位为未来开源模型的可扩展基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at

### [97] [Failure Modes of Maximum Entropy RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20265)
*Ömer Veysel Çağatan,Barış Akgün*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了最大熵强化学习在在线RLHF设置中的表现，并与SimPO进行了比较，发现参考无关的方法在不同设置中可能面临不同的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受SimPO在离线偏好优化中的强大表现的启发，我们调查了最大熵RL是否能在在线RLHF设置中达到类似结果。

Method: 我们研究了最大熵强化学习在在线RLHF设置中是否能取得类似SimPO的结果。

Result: 最大熵RL在非常低的学习率下仍然表现出过度优化和不稳定的KL动态，而KL约束方法保持了稳定的训练。

Conclusion: 我们的研究发现，参考无关的方法在应用于在线或离线偏好学习时可能面临不同的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be
derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized
temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method.
Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we
investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online
RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently
exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning
rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy
regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with
overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO
succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online
scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face
distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

### [98] [STARQA: A Question Answering Dataset for Complex Analytical Reasoning over Structured Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19508)
*Mounica Maddela,Lingjue Xie,Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro,Mausam*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文介绍了STARQA数据集，并评估了一种新的方法（Text2SQLCode），该方法将任务分解为SQL和Python的组合，以提高复杂分析推理问题的解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试在衡量文本到SQL的能力时，其问题的复杂性受到查询语言表达能力的限制，且没有专注于涉及复杂分析推理的问题。

Method: 引入了STARQA数据集，并评估了一种新的方法（Text2SQLCode），该方法将任务分解为SQL和Python的组合：SQL负责数据获取，而Python更自然地进行推理。

Result: 结果表明，与仅使用SQL相比，识别和结合SQL和Python的能力是有益的。

Conclusion: STARQA数据集对于现有的最先进的LLMs来说仍然具有挑战性，但识别和结合SQL和Python的能力比单独使用SQL更有益。

Abstract: Semantic parsing methods for converting text to SQL queries enable question
answering over structured data and can greatly benefit analysts who routinely
perform complex analytics on vast data stored in specialized relational
databases. Although several benchmarks measure the abilities of text to SQL,
the complexity of their questions is inherently limited by the level of
expressiveness in query languages and none focus explicitly on questions
involving complex analytical reasoning which require operations such as
calculations over aggregate analytics, time series analysis or scenario
understanding. In this paper, we introduce STARQA, the first public
human-created dataset of complex analytical reasoning questions and answers on
three specialized-domain databases. In addition to generating SQL directly
using LLMs, we evaluate a novel approach (Text2SQLCode) that decomposes the
task into a combination of SQL and Python: SQL is responsible for data
fetching, and Python more naturally performs reasoning. Our results demonstrate
that identifying and combining the abilities of SQL and Python is beneficial
compared to using SQL alone, yet the dataset still remains quite challenging
for the existing state-of-the-art LLMs.
