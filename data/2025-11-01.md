### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们的研究引入了StreetMath基准，用于评估大型语言模型在现实世界近似场景中的能力，并发现它们在近似任务中倾向于计算精确值或使用外部工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要关注大型语言模型（LLMs）在精确算术运算中的表现，但对其在非精确、快速数学操作中的近似推理能力的研究较少。

Method: 我们引入了StreetMath基准来评估模型在现实世界近似场景中的近似能力，并应用了机制可解释性技术来探测其内部计算状态。

Result: LLMs在需要近似推理的任务中通常尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具，且在解决近似任务时消耗更多标记。此外，精确和近似算术操作依赖于不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，LLMs在需要近似推理的任务中通常尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具，而并非表现出类似人类在街头数学中的认知懒惰。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的方法，用于对实体评论和用户查询进行情感分析，并根据意见的强度对实体进行排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的整体词典方法不考虑每个意见的强度，例如非常强烈的负面（或正面）意见、强烈的负面（或正面）意见、中等负面（或正面）意见、非常弱的负面（或正面）意见和弱的负面（或正面）意见。因此，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 本文使用模糊逻辑算法对意见词进行分类，并使用句法依赖解析来确定所需方面词的关系。同时，将与特定方面相关的意见词考虑在内，以计算该方面在评论中的实体得分。

Result: 本文提出的方法能够根据实体评论和用户查询的方向和强度对实体进行排序，并通过粒度级别（即非常弱、弱、中等、非常强和强）对意见词进行分类。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于整体词典的方法，通过结合与特定产品方面相关的意见词（如副词、形容词、名词和动词），对实体进行排序，并利用模糊逻辑算法和句法依赖解析来分类意见词。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个大规模的、目标无关的立场检测数据集LASTIST，用于填补研究空白并支持多种立场检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的研究主要集中在目标依赖的立场检测任务上，且大多数基准数据集基于英语，这使得在低资源语言如韩语中开发模型变得困难。因此，本文旨在解决这一研究空白。

Method: 本文收集并构建了LASTIST数据集，该数据集包含563,299个标记的韩语句子，并训练了最先进的深度学习和立场检测模型。

Result: 本文提供了关于如何收集和构建数据集的详细描述，并展示了LASTIST数据集在多种立场检测任务中的应用。

Conclusion: 本文提出了LASTIST数据集，以填补立场检测研究中的空白，并为各种立场检测任务提供支持。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为zFLoRA的新型低延迟适配器，用于优化大语言模型在推理时的性能，实验证明其在多个任务中表现优异且延迟几乎为零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于任务特定适配器虽然参数量小，但在推理时可能带来显著的延迟，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案来优化模型性能。

Method: 本文提出了一种零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），旨在减少任务特定适配器带来的额外计算负担，从而降低推理时间的延迟。

Result: 实验结果显示，zFLoRA在多个任务和不同硬件平台上均表现出色，与监督微调和其他低秩适配器方法相比具有优势。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，zFLoRA适配器在延迟方面表现出色，能够在不显著增加计算负担的情况下提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

### [5] [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Improving Circuit Faithfulness via Better Edge Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25786)
*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出三种改进方法以提高电路发现的准确性，包括自举法、基于比率的选择策略和整数线性规划公式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机制可解释性中的电路发现是一个主要挑战，确定模型中哪些部分执行给定任务。

Method: 我们使用了自举法来识别具有稳定归因分数的边，引入了一个基于比率的选择策略来优先考虑强正得分的边，并用整数线性规划公式替换了标准的贪心选择。

Result: 我们的方法产生了更忠实的电路，并在多个MIB任务和模型中优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个MIB任务和模型中优于之前的方法，能够生成更忠实的电路。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个利用大型语言模型作为零样本偏好代理的框架LISTEN，用于解决多目标决策问题，并展示了其在不同任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类专家在从大量具有多个竞争目标的项目中选择最佳选项时常常遇到困难，这一过程受到难以形式化复杂、隐含偏好的阻碍。

Method: 本文引入了LISTEN框架，该框架利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为零样本偏好代理，仅受专家的高层优先级指导。提出了两种迭代算法：LISTEN-U和LISTEN-T。

Result: 在飞行预订、购物和考试安排等多种任务上进行评估，结果表明LISTEN-U在偏好与参数对齐时表现优异，而LISTEN-T提供了更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 本文探索了通过自然语言直接引导复杂多目标决策的有前途的方向，减少了传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter是一种用于长上下文预训练数据筛选的框架，通过衡量扩展上下文的信息增益来选择高质量数据，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据中大部分段落可以通过局部上下文进行预测，这使得训练效率低下，因此需要精心选择数据。

Method: LongFilter通过对比长上下文和短上下文设置下的模型预测，衡量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，从而识别出需要长距离依赖性的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B上进行的实验表明，将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K时，LongFilter能够高效地选择高质量数据，并在HELMENT、LongBench和RULER等基准测试中取得显著提升。

Conclusion: LongFilter能够有效选择高质量的数据，并在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how persona adoption affects the fairness and consistency of harmful content classification in LLMs, revealing potential ideological biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fairness and neutrality in content moderation systems using large language models (LLMs).

Method: Examining how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities.

Result: Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to label content as harmful, and larger models tend to align more closely with personas from the same political ideology.

Conclusion: Persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR:  CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索提高了临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性，并提供了一个评估框架用于评估临床问答系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的临床文档以base64编码的附件形式存储在FHIR DocumentReference资源中，这使得语义问题回答变得困难。传统的向量数据库方法常常遗漏细微的临床关系。

Method: Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) 方法，使用实体感知检索，并开发了一个临床笔记QA评估平台来验证CLEAR。

Result: CLEAR在12份临床笔记上测试，取得了58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度为0.878，并且使用的标记减少了78%。在长文档中表现最佳，超过65,000个标记的文档有75%的胜率。

Conclusion: 这些发现证实了实体感知检索在临床自然语言处理中提高了效率和准确性。评估框架提供了一个可重复使用和透明的基准，用于评估需要语义精度和计算效率的临床问答系统。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM-based工具在语言资源创建中具有潜力，但对其性能和影响的全面评估仍缺失，特别是在基于视角的NLP方法下。

Method: 该论文采用比较方法，评估了三种实验设置下的标注时间、覆盖率和多样性：人工、自动和半自动标注。

Result: 结果表明，半自动标注设置在帧多样性方面优于人工标注，而自动标注在所有指标上表现较差，除了标注时间。

Conclusion: 该论文通过评估LLM-based语义角色标注器在FrameNet-like语义标注中的应用，填补了对这类工具在语言资源创建中的性能和影响的全面评估的空白。结果表明，半自动标注设置在帧多样性方面优于人工标注，而自动标注在所有指标上表现较差，除了标注时间。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一种代理流程，旨在从大型语言模型输出中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，通过反馈循环和越狱模块提高效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据时，如何确定其看到的内容？研究认为，最有力的证据是模型本身自由地再现目标内容。

Method: RECAP是一个基于反馈循环的代理流程，用于引出和验证记忆的训练数据。它包括一个二次语言模型来评估初始提取尝试，并通过最小的修正提示来引导后续生成。此外，还包含一个越狱模块来克服对齐引起的拒绝。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试中，RECAP的表现优于单次迭代方法。例如，使用GPT-4.1时，版权文本提取的平均ROUGE-L分数从0.38提高到0.47，增加了近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP能够显著提高从大型语言模型输出中提取训练数据的效果，特别是在处理版权文本时。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，适当的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言数据混合对预训练大语言模型的影响，挑战关于多语言训练的常见信念。

Method: 训练1.1B和3B参数的LLM，在多样化的多语言语料库上进行训练，变化的语言数量从25到400。

Result: 结合英语和多语言数据不会必然降低任何一组的语言内性能，使用英语作为枢纽语言在不同语言家族中都有益，且增加训练语言数量并不会导致“多语言诅咒”。

Conclusion: 研究发现，当多语言数据平衡适当的时候，可以增强语言模型的能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源环境中也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了机器翻译中文化对齐的重要性，发现文化差异会导致标签漂移，并强调了在机器翻译中考虑文化因素的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管情感保留在翻译中已被长期研究，但源语言和目标语言之间的文化对齐作用是一个关键但未被充分探索的因素。我们假设语义标签在翻译过程中由于文化差异而发生漂移。

Method: 通过一系列实验，我们在文化敏感和中性领域进行了研究，分析了机器翻译系统（包括现代大型语言模型）在翻译过程中产生的标签漂移现象。

Result: 我们得出三个主要发现：(1) 机器翻译系统，包括现代大型语言模型，在翻译过程中会导致标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域；(2) 与早期统计机器翻译工具不同，大型语言模型编码了文化知识，利用这些知识可以放大标签漂移；(3) 源语言和目标语言之间的文化相似性或差异性是标签保留的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，忽视文化因素在机器翻译中会损害标签的准确性，并可能在下游应用中引发误解和文化冲突。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SymCode，一种神经符号框架，用于将数学问题解决任务重新表述为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务。评估显示，在多个基准测试中，SymCode的准确性显著提高，并且能够将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转变为透明的程序错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂的数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成导致未经验证且算术不正确的解决方案。当前的提示策略如Chain of Thought仍然在这个不可靠的媒介中运行，缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode，这是一种神经符号框架，将数学问题解决任务重新表述为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等具有挑战性的基准测试中评估SymCode，结果显示其准确性比基线提高了高达13.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM推理置于确定性符号引擎中，SymCode代表了在形式领域中更准确和可信赖的人工智能的重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

TL;DR: 本文设计了一种针对Trainium的高性能矩阵乘法，通过内核融合和新型缓存策略优化数据移动和SRAM带宽，显著提升了大语言模型推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium是一种由亚马逊网络服务（AWS）最近开发的AI加速器，通过其异构架构为大语言模型的训练和推理提供了有吸引力的选择。然而，利用Trainium架构实现高性能可能会很困难，因为其流水线阵列架构和对数据布局的特殊要求

Method: 我们设计了高性能的矩阵乘法（matmul），这是大语言模型推理的关键计算内核。我们引入了一系列针对Trainium的定制化技术，基于内核融合和新颖的缓存策略，以减少数据在软件管理的内存层次结构中的移动，最大化SRAM带宽，并避免昂贵的矩阵转置

Result: 在九个数据集和四个最近的大语言模型上进行评估，我们的系统大大优于AWS在Trainium上实现的最先进的矩阵乘法：在矩阵乘法内核层面，平均加速1.35倍（最高可达2.22倍），这转化为端到端的大语言模型推理平均加速1.66倍（最高可达2.49倍）

Conclusion: 我们的系统在矩阵乘法内核层面平均实现了1.35倍的加速（最高可达2.22倍），这转化为端到端的大语言模型推理平均1.66倍的加速（最高可达2.49倍）

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: AttnCache通过重用相似的注意力图来加速LLM推理的预填充阶段，显著提高了性能，同时保持了高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多实际应用场景中，如分类、问答、推荐和文本嵌入，仅需要模型的预填充阶段，而自注意力计算由于其与序列长度的二次复杂性成为性能瓶颈。

Method: AttnCache通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来加速预填充阶段的自注意力计算。

Result: 实验结果表明，AttnCache在CPU上实现了平均1.2倍的端到端和2倍的注意力加速，在GPU上实现了平均1.6倍的端到端和3倍的注意力加速，且准确性几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: AttnCache能够显著加速LLM推理的预填充阶段，同时保持几乎不变的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SRL的框架，通过将问题解决重新表述为生成一系列逻辑“动作”，来解决小规模开源模型在多步骤推理任务中的困难。SRL通过在每一步中基于模型动作与专家动作之间的相似性提供更平滑的奖励，从而在所有轨迹都不正确的情况下提供更丰富的学习信号，同时鼓励由专家演示引导的灵活推理。结果表明，SRL使小型模型能够学习之前无法通过SFT或RLVR学习的挑战性问题，并且在SRL初始化训练后使用RLVR进行优化可以实现最佳整体性能。此外，SRL在推理基准之外还能有效泛化到代理软件工程任务，证明了其作为面向推理的LLM的稳健和多功能训练框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation.

Method: SRL reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical 'actions'. It trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner.

Result: SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: PORTool是一种基于强化学习的方法，用于提高工具使用大语言模型在动态环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具使用的大语言模型在动态工具调用环境中表现有限，无法探索可能的解决方案。

Method: PORTool采用强化学习方法，通过生成多个轨迹并为每个步骤分配奖励，计算叉状优势和轨迹相对优势来训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，PORTool在17个工具上处理用户查询时，显著提高了最终准确性和工具调用步骤的数量。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习方法提高了工具使用大语言模型在动态工具调用环境中的性能，显著提升了最终准确性以及工具调用步骤的数量。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了跨语言对齐（CLA）可能导致的文化擦除问题，并提出了一种新的方法Surgical Steering，以在推理阶段解耦事实传递和文化特定知识，从而更好地平衡这两个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐（CLA）旨在对齐多语言表示，使大型语言模型（LLMs）能够无缝地在不同语言之间转移知识。然而，我们假设这种追求表示收敛的努力可能会无意中导致“文化擦除”，即提供文化情境响应的功能损失，这些响应应根据查询语言而有所不同。因此，我们需要系统地分析这种权衡，并提出一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们引入了一个全面的评估框架——迁移-定位平面，用于量化知识迁移和文化擦除的程度。通过这个框架，我们重新评估了最近的跨语言对齐方法，并发现了它们在所有六种语言中都以文化定位为代价提高了事实传递。此外，我们还分析了模型内部表示，发现了通用事实传递和文化特定知识可以在不同模型层面上进行最优控制。基于此，我们提出了Surgical Steering方法，在推理阶段解耦这两个目标。

Result: 我们发现，现有的跨语言对齐方法在提高事实传递的同时，会直接导致文化定位的损失。通过分析模型内部表示，我们发现通用的事实传递和文化特定知识可以在不同的模型层面上进行最优控制。基于此，我们提出了Surgical Steering方法，在推理阶段解耦这两个目标，从而更好地平衡两个竞争维度，克服当前对齐技术的局限性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究发现，当前的跨语言对齐方法在提高事实传递的同时，会直接导致文化定位的损失。通过分析模型内部表示，我们发现通用的事实传递和文化特定知识可以在不同的模型层面上进行最优控制。基于这一发现，我们提出了Surgical Steering方法，在推理阶段解耦这两个目标，从而更好地平衡两个竞争维度，克服当前对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并验证了一个自然语言处理（NLP）管道，用于在放射学报告中识别偶然甲状腺发现（ITFs），并评估其患病率、特征和临床结果。结果显示，ITFs常见，并与导致检测到小而低风险癌症的后续流程密切相关。这些发现强调了ITFs在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用，并需要标准化报告和更选择性的随访。

Motivation: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.

Method: A transformer-based NLP pipeline identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from multiple modalities and body regions. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related factors.

Result: Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9% women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF.

Conclusion: ITFs were common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small, low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective follow-up.

Motivation: 由于在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）中，大型语言模型的应用仍存在空白，因此我们提出了QCoder基准。

Method: 我们引入了QCoder基准，这是一个评估框架，用于评估大型语言模型在量子编程中的表现，并从模拟硬件设备中获取反馈。

Result: 即使先进的模型如GPT-4o也只能达到约18.97%的准确率，而基于推理的模型如o3可以达到高达78%的准确率，超过了人类编写代码的平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: 我们释放了QCoder基准数据集和公共评估API以支持进一步的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了1PNS训练范式和RPD指标，以提高大语言模型在TTS中的推理多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的“一个题目一个解法”(1P1S)训练方式导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了TTS的效果。

Method: 提出了一种“一个题目多个解法”(1PNS)的训练范式，并引入了推理路径差异(RPD)作为衡量多步骤思维链之间语义差异的指标。

Result: 实验表明，使用RPD选择的训练数据可以产生更多样化的输出，并在pass@k指标上有所提升，平均在pass@16上提高了2.80%，在AIME24上提高了4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS进一步增强了TTS的有效性，通过引入RPD指标，可以提高模型输出的多样性并提升性能。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Motivation: 该研究的动机是探索说服技巧和语篇关系之间的关系，因为现有的数据集中没有同时标注这两种元素。通过这种研究，可以更好地理解说服性文本的结构，并帮助检测在线宣传和虚假信息。

Method: 该研究利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和提示工程来探讨说服技巧（PTs）和语篇关系（DRs）之间的关系。由于没有同时标注PTs和DRs的数据集，研究者以SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集为基础，该数据集标注了19种PTs，并开发了基于LLM的分类器，将数据集中的每个实例标记为22种PDTB 3.0二级DRs之一。共评估了四种LLMs，使用了10种不同的提示，产生了40个独特的DR分类器。使用不同多数投票策略的集成模型创建了5个银数据集，这些数据集中的实例同时标注了说服技巧和二级PDTB意义。

Result: 统计分析表明，六种语篇关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步和条件）在说服性文本中起着关键作用，尤其是在使用带有偏见的语言、夸大/最小化、重复和提出疑问时。

Conclusion: 该研究的结论是，六种语篇关系（即原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步和条件）在说服性文本中起着关键作用，特别是在使用带有偏见的语言、夸大/最小化、重复和提出疑问等方面。这一见解有助于检测在线宣传和虚假信息，并增进我们对有效沟通的理解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Motivation: Prevailing SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially limiting their expressiveness.

Method: MossNet, a novel mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head attention (MHA).

Result: Extensive experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens, further confirm its scalability and superior performance. Real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly sized baselines.

Conclusion: MossNet is a compelling new direction for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Result: 实验结果表明，与强大的监督基线相比，SDM语言模型可以显著减少拒绝现象，提高统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型可以通过监督微调将现有的预训练解码器-only Transformer LMs转换为具有更少拒绝（即提高统计效率）的模型。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

### [27] [RCScore: Quantifying Response Consistency in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26193)
*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore evaluates how instruction style impacts LLM performance, revealing significant accuracy variations and highlighting the importance of stylistic consistency for model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template, overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for real-world deployments.

Method: RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework that quantifies how instruction formulation affects model responses. Cross-Response Similarity (CRS) is introduced to measure stylistic self-consistency.

Result: Experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. CRS shows strong correlation with task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model reliability. Deterministic decoding produces more stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with cross-style consistency.

Conclusion: RCScore offers a principled approach to assess instruction robustness.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了TTA方法，通过时间步分配实现软性排序，以解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，从而提高可控性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散语言模型在实际控制能力上仍然脆弱，由于统一且上下文无关的更新导致了token级别的波动，破坏了累积优化过程。

Method: 提出了一种称为Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)的方法，通过每个token的时间步调度实现软性和语义的token排序。

Result: TTA在情感控制任务中提高了超过20%的准确性，并将困惑度几乎减半，使用不到五分之一的步骤；在去毒任务中，降低了最大毒性（12.2 vs 14.5）和困惑度（26.0 vs 32.0）。

Conclusion: TTA通过时间步分配实现软性排序，是缓解更新遗忘并实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键杠杆。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: WIMHF是一种使用稀疏自编码器来解释反馈数据的方法，它可以识别出人类可解释的特征，从而帮助从业者更好地理解和使用偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可以以不可预测和不希望的方式改变语言模型，因为从业者缺乏对反馈数据所编码内容的清晰理解。

Method: WIMHF是一种使用稀疏自编码器来解释反馈数据的方法。

Result: WIMHF在7个数据集中识别出少量的人类可解释特征，这些特征占用了黑盒模型获得的偏好预测信号的大部分。这些特征揭示了人类偏好的广泛多样性以及数据集级上下文的作用。

Conclusion: WIMHF提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，使从业者能够更好地理解和使用偏好数据。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GlobalQA基准和GlobalRAG框架，用于评估和提升全局RAG任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG任务，而许多现实应用需要全局RAG能力，即从整个文档集合中提取信息并进行分析。

Method: 本文引入了GlobalQA基准来评估全局RAG能力，并提出了GlobalRAG框架，该框架通过多工具协作、保留结构连贯性、引入LLM驱动的智能过滤器和聚合模块来解决全局RAG任务中的挑战。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG实现了6.63 F1得分，远超最强基线的1.51 F1得分，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了GlobalRAG框架，通过多工具协作、保留结构连贯性、引入LLM驱动的智能过滤器和聚合模块，显著提升了全局RAG任务的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 本研究展示了将语用理论作为提示提供给语言模型，可以有效提高其理解隐含意义的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确解释隐含意义在人类交流和语言使用中起着至关重要的作用，语言模型也应具备这种能力。

Method: 我们提出了一种方法，其中语用理论的概述（如Gricean语用学和关联理论）作为提示提供给语言模型，引导其通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比，我们的方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上的得分提高了高达9.6%。此外，即使不详细解释语用理论，仅在提示中提及它们的名称也会在大型模型上带来一定的性能提升（约1-3%）。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，将语用理论作为提示提供给语言模型是一种有效的上下文学习方法，用于理解隐含意义的任务。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否能够像人类一样区分借词和本族词汇，特别是在双语社区中。

Method: 我们评估了多种模型在10种语言上的表现，以研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似的能力来识别借词。

Result: 结果显示，尽管有明确的指令和上下文信息，模型在区分借词和本族词汇方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 我们的工作对开发针对少数语言的NLP工具以及支持在受主导语言词汇压力下的语言社区的语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Motivation: 本文旨在研究知识蒸馏（KD）在多语言视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中的应用，以解决模型规模缩小时性能不均的问题。

Method: 本文进行了一项受控的实证研究，探讨了五种蒸馏方法在跨语言表示一致性和下游性能稳定性方面的表现，同时在模型压缩下进行了分析。

Result: 本文发现，一些配置在模型大小减半的情况下可以保持甚至提高多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了设计敏感的权衡，这些权衡不能仅通过聚合准确性来揭示。

Conclusion: 本文发现，一些配置在模型大小减半的情况下可以保持甚至提高多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了设计敏感的权衡，这些权衡不能仅通过聚合准确性来揭示。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NAD方法，利用神经元激活的内部信号进行无标签集成解码，实现了高效且高质量的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略仅使用外部输出（如标记概率、熵或自我评估）对候选进行评分，这些信号在后训练后可能校准不良。本文分析内部行为，基于神经元激活发现三个现象，并提出NAD方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于神经元一致性的无监督最佳N方法（NAD），该方法仅使用内部信号进行候选选择，无需比较文本输出。

Result: NAD在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当，在开放式的编码基准测试中优于Avg@64。通过早期剪枝，NAD将令牌使用量减少了99%，同时生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: NAD利用内部信号提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的无标签集成解码指导，通过早期正确性预测和激进的提前停止，显著减少了令牌使用量，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的工作表明，不同的大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理数字时会收敛到相似且准确的输入嵌入表示。然而，这些发现与记录的大型语言模型在处理数字信息时产生错误输出的倾向相矛盾。因此，我们旨在解释这种矛盾。

Method: 我们探索了语言模型如何处理数字并量化这些机制的准确性下限。

Result: 尽管出现错误，不同的语言模型学习了可互换的数字表示，这些表示是系统性的、高度准确且在隐藏状态和输入上下文类型中普遍适用的。这使我们能够为每个LLM创建通用探针，并将包括输出错误原因在内的信息追溯到特定层。

Conclusion: 我们的结果为预训练大型语言模型如何处理数字提供了基本理解，并概述了更准确的探测技术在改进大型语言模型架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess Atlas's performance in dynamic, interactive environments and identify its strengths and weaknesses.

Method: We conducted an early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based games as test scenarios.

Result: Atlas performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku but struggles in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control.

Conclusion: Atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing but has notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SCRIBE框架，该框架通过多跳和工具增强的推理来生成有效的学生反馈回答，并展示了其在低资源和隐私敏感教育应用中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型可以用于教育环境中提供交互式、个性化的学生反馈。然而，现实世界的部署面临三个关键挑战：隐私问题、计算资源有限以及需要符合教学有效的回应。这些限制要求小型开源模型能够在本地运行，并可靠地将其输出基于正确信息。

Method: 我们引入了SCRIBE，这是一个多跳、工具增强的推理框架，旨在生成关于反馈报告的有效回答。SCRIBE结合了特定领域的工具与自我反思的推理流程，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复。我们通过两阶段LoRA微调将这些能力提炼到3B和8B模型中，数据来源于合成的GPT-4o生成数据。

Result: 评估结果显示，8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上与更大的模型相当或更优，同时被学生认为与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了SCRIBE在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform in specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep, principled understanding.

Method: ACER transforms generalist models into domain experts by synthesizing a comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum and using it for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule.

Result: Experiments with Llama 3.2 show significant gains in specialized MMLU subsets, with improvements of up to 5 percentage points in challenging domains like microeconomics. ACER also prevents catastrophic forgetting and facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Motivation: 健康相关错误信息非常普遍且可能有害，难以识别，尤其是在声明扭曲或误解科学发现时。

Method: 我们提出了MisSynth，这是一个应用检索增强生成（RAG）来生成合成谬误样本的管道，然后用于微调LLM模型。

Result: 结果表明，与原始基线相比，微调后的模型在MISSCI测试集上取得了显著的准确率提升。例如，微调后的LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MISSCI测试集上的F1分数绝对提升了超过35%。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，引入合成谬误数据可以显著提高有限标注资源下的零样本LLM分类性能，即使计算资源有限。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Motivation: 尽管基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多智能体方法代表了一种有希望的策略，以超越单个模型的能力，但其成功关键取决于协同团队的组成。然而，形成最佳团队是一个重大挑战，因为大多数模型的固有不透明性掩盖了有效协作所需的内部特征。

Method: 我们提出了一种以互动为中心的框架，用于自动团队组成，不需要任何先验知识，包括它们的内部架构、训练数据或任务性能。我们的方法构建了一个“语言模型图”，从成对对话的语义连贯性映射模型之间的关系，然后应用社区检测来识别协同模型聚类。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了一个新的基础，用于自动化设计协作的多智能体LLM团队。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Conclusion: 本文提出了对预训练语言模型和大型语言模型在科学写作中的话语关系分类任务中的初步研究，并分析了上下文对任务的帮助。

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了OmniEduBench，一个全面的中文教育基准，用于评估LLMs在教育领域的表现。实验结果显示LLMs在知识和培养维度上仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs和其基准主要关注知识维度，忽略了对培养能力的评估，且当前基准通常局限于单一学科或题型，缺乏多样性。

Method: 引入了OmniEduBench，这是一个全面的中文教育基准。

Result: 在知识维度中，只有Gemini-2.5 Pro的准确率超过了60%，而在培养维度中，表现最好的模型QWQ仍比人类智能差近30%。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了改进的大量空间，并强调了将LLMs应用于教育中的挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

*Zeliang Zong,Kai Zhang,Zheyang Li,Wenming Tan,Ye Ren,Yiyan Zhai,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSLC is a new method that combines sparse optimization and low-rank approximation to efficiently compress large language models without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of LLMs is limited by high bandwidth and computational demands, and the synergy between pruning and low-rank approximation has not been fully explored.

Method: SSLC combines sparse optimization and low-rank approximation through an iterative optimization algorithm to compress LLMs.

Result: SSLC outperforms standalone methods in experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models, achieving state-of-the-art results with 50% compression and 1.63x speedup for Qwen2.5.

Conclusion: SSLC provides a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment by achieving significant compression without performance loss.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯网络的LLM融合框架（BNLF），通过整合多个LLM的预测结果，在情感分析任务中取得了更高的准确率，并提升了模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLMs）在透明度、可解释性、成本、提示工程、领域一致性以及环境影响方面存在诸多问题，因此需要一种更有效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: BNLF框架通过贝叶斯网络将FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet的预测结果进行概率融合，以提高情感分析的准确性。

Result: BNLF在三个不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上实现了比基线LLMs高出约6%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: BNLF框架在三个金融语料库上表现出色，证明了其对数据集变化的鲁棒性和概率融合在可解释情感分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 研究旨在确定多个大语言模型的集合是否能比单个模型更可靠地评估像素级AI分诊工具。结果表明，由中型到大型开源大语言模型组成的集合在评估临床AI分诊工具方面比单个模型更一致和可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集合是否可以共同提供比单个LLM更可靠的像素级AI分诊工具评估。

Method: 从十四家医院的29,766例非对比头部CT检查中处理了一个商业性颅内出血（ICH）AI检测工具。放射科报告通过八个开源大语言模型和一个符合HIPAA的内部GPT-4o版本进行分析，使用一个单次多射击提示来评估是否存在ICH。1,726个例子被手动审查。比较了八个开源模型和共识与GPT-4o的性能特征。测试了三个理想的共识LLM集合来评估分诊工具的性能。

Result: 队列包括29,766对头部CT检查-报告。最高AUC性能由llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o实现（AUC= 0.78）。最高平均精度为Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o（AP=0.75 & 0.76）。Llama3.3:70b具有最高的F1分数（0.81）和召回率（0.85），更高的精确度（0.78）、特异性（0.72）和MCC（0.57）。使用MCC（95% CI）的理想组合是：Full-9 Ensemble 0.571（0.552-0.591），Top-3 Ensemble 0.558（0.537-0.579），Consensus 0.556（0.539-0.574），以及GPT4o 0.522（0.500-0.543）。Top-3、Full-9和Consensus之间没有统计学显著差异（p > 0.05）。

Conclusion: 一个由中型到大型开源大语言模型组成的集合提供了一种更一致和可靠的方法，以推导临床AI分诊工具的地面真实回顾评估，优于单独使用一个大语言模型。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对CORE-KG进行了系统的消融研究，以评估其两个关键组件的影响。结果表明，指代消解和结构化提示在减少节点重复和噪声方面起着重要作用。这些发现为设计从复杂法律文本中提取结构化表示的稳健LLM管道提供了实证见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类走私网络日益适应性强且难以分析。法律案件文件提供了关键的见解，但通常是非结构化的，词汇密集且充满模糊或变化的引用，这对自动知识图谱（KG）构建构成了重大挑战。虽然基于LLM的方法优于静态模板，但它们仍然生成噪声大、碎片化的图，由于缺乏引导提取和指代消解，导致重复节点。最近提出的CORE-KG框架通过整合类型感知的指代模块和领域引导的结构化提示，显著减少了节点重复和法律噪声。

Method: 我们对CORE-KG进行了系统的消融研究，以量化其两个关键组件的单独贡献。

Result: 结果表明，移除指代消解会导致节点重复增加28.32%和噪声节点增加4.32%，而移除结构化提示会导致节点重复增加4.34%和噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计从复杂法律文本中提取结构化表示的稳健LLM管道提供了实证见解。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语的变音恢复对于确保准确的单词发音和消除文本意义的歧义至关重要，尽管该语言在未变音时具有高度的歧义性，但最近的机器学习方法已显著提高了性能。

Method: DIVRIT将任务视为零样本分类问题，通过动态生成的候选集选择最合适的变音模式，并利用希伯来文视觉语言模型处理未变音文本作为图像。

Result: 系统在各种配置下表现出色，无需依赖复杂的显式语言分析，在“理想”设置中达到了高水平的准确性，并通过战略架构增强和优化训练方法显著提高了系统的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了视觉表示在准确和自动化希伯来语变音符号中的潜在前景。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究分析了Transformer语言模型中线性关系解码器的结构，发现它们主要基于属性而非特定关系，并展示了这些解码器可以被高度压缩而不损失解码准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在分析Transformer语言模型中线性操作符的结构，特别是这些操作符如何解码特定的关系事实。

Method: 我们扩展了Hernandez等人（2023）的单个关系发现，系统地绘制了关系解码器的组织结构，并通过简单的三阶张量网络对这些关系解码器集合进行了高度压缩。此外，我们开发了一种交叉评估协议，以解释这种意想不到的冗余。

Result: 我们发现这些线性映射并不编码不同的关系，而是提取重复的、粗粒度的语义属性。这种以属性为中心的结构解释了操作符的可压缩性，并突显了它们仅能泛化到语义接近的新关系的原因。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，线性关系解码在Transformer语言模型中主要是基于属性的，而不是特定于关系的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在深度搜索场景中面临奖励密度低的问题，这导致代理需要付出大量的探索成本才能获得稀少且常常为零的最终奖励。

Method: InfoFlow是一个系统框架，从三个方面解决奖励密度优化问题：1) 子问题分解，2) 失败引导提示，3) 双代理精炼。

Result: InfoFlow在多个代理搜索基准上显著优于强基线，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow在多个代理搜索基准上进行了评估，显著优于强大的基线，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）面临显著的推理延迟挑战，这源于它们的自回归设计和大规模。为了应对这一问题，推测解码成为一种解决方案，能够同时生成和验证多个标记。然而，最近的方法往往忽略了GPU设备和批量大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的动态树解码方法，称为CAST，它考虑了推理成本，包括GPU配置和批量大小等因素，以动态优化树结构。

Result: 通过在六个不同的任务和六种不同的LLM上进行全面的实验，我们的方法展示了显著的结果，实现了比传统解码方法快5.2倍的速度，并且通常优于现有的最先进的技术5%到20%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在六个不同的任务和六种不同的LLM上进行了全面的实验，结果表明其在速度上比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，并且通常优于现有的最先进的技术5%到20%。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: SlideAgent is a framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, showing significant improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages.

Method: SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levels - global, page, and element to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Conclusion: SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary and open-source models in understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

TL;DR: 本文比较了编码器-解码器LLM（RedLLM）和解码器-only LLM（DecLLM），发现RedLLM在扩展性和推理效率方面表现优异，尽管在预训练期间计算效率较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于从编码器-解码器建模到解码器-only建模的快速转变缺乏严谨的比较分析，特别是从扩展的角度来看，这引发了对编码器-解码器模型潜力可能被忽视的担忧。

Method: 我们重新审视了编码器-解码器LLM（RedLLM），并将其与最近的解码器-only LLM（DecLLM）进行了全面比较。

Result: 实验表明，RedLLM表现出有吸引力的扩展特性，并且性能出人意料地强大。虽然DecLLM在预训练期间总体上更计算优化，但RedLLM展示了相当的扩展和上下文长度外推能力。经过指令调优后，RedLLM在各种下游任务中取得了可比甚至更好的结果，同时享受显著更好的推理效率。

Conclusion: 我们的研究希望激发更多对RedLLM的重新审视，以释放其在开发强大且高效的LLM方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Evontree的新框架，通过少量高质量的本体规则来系统地提取、验证和增强大型语言模型中的领域知识，无需大量外部数据集。实验结果表明，该方法在低资源领域适应性方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据敏感领域如医疗保健中，缺乏高质量的特定领域训练语料库阻碍了LLMs在专业应用中的适应性。同时，领域专家已将领域知识归纳为本体规则，这些规则形式化了概念之间的关系并确保了知识管理存储库的完整性。

Method: Evontree框架利用少量高质量的本体规则，系统地从原始模型中提取、验证和增强领域知识，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼的知识。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在低资源领域适应性方面表现出有效、高效和稳健的特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms full attention in various scenarios, with improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to introduce a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across various scenarios, including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement learning scaling regimes.

Method: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that uses Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a finer-grained gating mechanism. It also uses a bespoke chunkwise algorithm with a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices.

Result: Kimi Linear outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding throughput for a 1M context.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco is a novel architecture that enables truly 'end-to-end' generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. It outperforms default methods and can interpret natural language commands to adjust its sampling strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'end-to-end' label for LLMs is a misnomer because they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters. The paper aims to introduce a solution that allows the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.

Method: AutoDeco is a novel architecture that enables truly 'end-to-end' generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. It augments the standard transformer with lightweight heads that dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits.

Result: Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, AutoDeco significantly outperforms default decoding strategies and achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline. It also demonstrates the ability to interpret natural language commands and adjust its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis.

Conclusion: AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline. Additionally, it demonstrates an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型在后训练过程中价值观对齐的机制，发现SFT阶段对模型价值观的建立起着关键作用，而后续的偏好优化很少能重新对齐这些价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在社会中的作用越来越重要，它们面临着需要不仅依赖于一般知识，还要与某些人类价值体系对齐的问题。因此，研究大语言模型与人类价值观的对齐变得至关重要。然而，之前的工作主要集中在评估完全训练好的模型的对齐情况，而忽略了模型在训练过程中学习表达人类价值观的动态过程。

Method: 我们分析了后训练算法和数据集的影响，测量了训练过程中价值观漂移的幅度和时间。我们使用Llama-3和Qwen-3模型进行了实验，并利用合成偏好数据集来控制价值观的操纵。

Result: 我们发现SFT阶段通常建立了模型的价值观，而后续的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。此外，使用合成偏好数据集，我们发现不同的偏好优化算法即使在偏好数据保持不变的情况下也会导致不同的价值观对齐结果。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了关于后训练过程中价值观如何被学习的实用见解，并有助于指导数据整理以及选择用于偏好优化的模型和算法，以提高模型与人类价值观的一致性。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个具有奥林匹克级别难度的数学推理基准测试，旨在评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。实验结果显示当前模型的表现较差，但存在提升的空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学竞赛基准测试由于性能饱和而不再适合评估顶级大型语言模型，因此需要一个更具挑战性的基准测试来推动数学推理能力的进步。

Method: AMO-Bench通过专家交叉验证确保问题达到国际数学奥林匹克竞赛（IMO）难度标准，并且所有问题都是原创的，以防止性能泄露。此外，每个问题只需要最终答案，从而实现了自动和稳健的评分。

Result: 在AMO-Bench上对26个大型语言模型的实验结果表明，即使表现最好的模型也只能达到52.4%的准确率，大多数模型得分低于40%。进一步分析显示，在增加测试时计算资源的情况下，存在有希望的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: AMO-Bench展示了当前大型语言模型在数学推理方面的显著提升空间，并通过提供一个具有奥林匹克级别难度的基准测试，促进了相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的广泛应用，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估。

Method: 提出Gistify任务，要求编码大语言模型创建一个单一、最小、自包含的文件来重现代码库的特定功能。

Result: 当前最先进的模型难以可靠地解决Gistify任务，特别是在执行时间较长的任务上。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的模型在解决Gistify任务时表现出困难，尤其是在执行时间较长的任务上。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: Nexus is a multi-agent framework for test oracle generation that outperforms existing methods, improving accuracy and enhancing downstream tasks like bug detection and program repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge in software engineering, requiring accurate oracles to determine whether a function under test behaves as intended for a given input.

Method: Nexus is a multi-agent framework that generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents. These agents collaborate in a structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement to produce accurate oracles.

Result: Nexus improves test-level oracle accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. It also enhances downstream tasks, increasing the bug detection rate of GPT-4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval from 90.91% to 95.45%, and the success rate of automated program repair from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Conclusion: Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in test oracle generation, significantly improving downstream tasks such as bug detection and automated program repair.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SecureReviewer的新方法，旨在增强LLM在代码审查中识别和解决安全问题的能力。通过构建专门的数据集、采用安全感知微调策略、集成RAG技术以及引入新的评估指标SecureBLEU，实验结果表明SecureReviewer在多个方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开发生命周期的早期阶段识别和解决安全问题对于减轻对软件系统的长期负面影响至关重要。代码审查作为一种有效的实践，使开发人员可以在将代码集成到代码库之前检查队友的代码。为了简化审查评论的生成，已经提出了各种自动代码审查方法，其中基于LLM的方法显著提高了自动审查生成的能力。然而，现有模型主要关注通用代码审查，它们在识别和解决安全相关问题方面的有效性仍未得到充分探索。此外，将现有的代码审查方法适应于针对安全问题面临重大挑战，包括数据稀缺和评估指标不足。

Method: 我们首先构建了一个针对训练和评估安全代码审查能力的数据集。利用这个数据集，我们微调LLM以生成能够有效识别安全问题并提供修复建议的代码审查评论，采用我们提出的安全感知微调策略。为了减少LLM中的幻觉并提高其输出的可靠性，我们集成了RAG技术，将生成的评论扎根于特定领域的安全知识。此外，我们引入了SecureBLEU，这是一种新的评估指标，旨在评估审查评论在解决安全问题方面的有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SecureReviewer在安全问题检测准确性和生成的审查评论的整体质量和实用价值方面都优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，SecureReviewer在安全问题检测准确性和生成的审查评论的整体质量和实用价值方面都优于最先进的基线。

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中的有效性，特别是在动态海洋环境下的水下目标检测任务中。

Method: 首先评估了时间增强的YOLOv5变体T-YOLOv5的性能，并将其与标准YOLOv5进行比较。然后通过添加卷积块注意模块（CBAM）开发了T-YOLOv5的增强版本。

Result: YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5与CBAM的mAP@50-95分别为0.813和0.811，显示出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测的可靠性，而T-YOLOv5与CBAM的结合在复杂场景中进一步提升了性能，尽管在简单场景中准确性有所下降。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

Conclusion: CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在视频的时间信息掌握上较弱且评估不足，因此需要一个能够测试其时间方向推断能力的基准。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH，一个经过心理物理学验证的基准，测试VLMs能否使用与人类相同的刺激和行为基线推断自然视频中的时间方向。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近随机，即使最好的模型在物理不可逆过程和因果手动动作上的准确率也远低于人类。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：尽管它们捕捉了丰富的视觉-语义相关性，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在视觉推理任务中显著提升了模型性能，平均优于传统的自我改进方法3.86分。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Method: 我们对领先的Veo-3进行了实证研究，评估了其在12个维度上的推理行为，包括空间、几何、物理、时间以及具身逻辑，并整理了MME-CoF基准以标准化研究。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型在作为独立的零样本推理器方面还不够可靠，但作为与专门推理模型配合的视觉引擎显示出令人鼓舞的迹象。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MemEIC的新方法，用于LVLM中的持续和组合知识编辑（CCKE）。该方法通过混合外部-内部编辑器、双外部内存和双LoRA适配器实现视觉和文本知识的顺序组合编辑，并引入了一个受大脑启发的知识连接器来整合不同模态的信息。实验表明，MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上表现优异，并有效保留了之前的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识编辑技术通常专注于单独编辑视觉或语言模态，而忽略了LVLM固有的多模态性和知识更新的连续性，这可能导致在考虑模态间相互作用和持续知识精炼时出现次优的编辑结果。

Method: MemEIC方法采用了一个混合的外部-内部编辑器，包括用于跨模态证据检索的双外部内存和促进每个模态解耦参数更新的双LoRA适配器。一个关键组件是受大脑启发的知识连接器，它在组合推理时被选择性激活，以整合不同模态的信息。

Result: MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上的性能显著提升，并有效保留了之前的编辑，为CCKE在LVLM中设立了新的基准。

Conclusion: 实验表明，MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升了性能，并有效保留了之前的编辑，为LVLM中的CCKE设立了新的基准。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自我蒸馏的冷启动框架SPECS，通过解耦多模态学习，提高了模型的泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于SFT的冷启动方法可能会导致指令式过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并最终影响下游RL。因此，我们需要一种更好的冷启动方法来提高模型的泛化能力和性能。

Method: 我们提出了SPECS-一个基于自我蒸馏的冷启动框架，该框架解耦了多模态学习：(1)通过自我蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；(2)进行基于偏好的训练，专注于浅层、可转移的表面形式标准；(3)将结果交给RL以获得深度推理结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的解耦学习框架在多个多模态基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升，如MEGA-Bench提升了4.1%，MathVista提升了12.2%。此外，SPECS有助于减少分布内“卡住”现象，提高探索能力，稳定训练并提升性能上限。

Conclusion: 我们的解耦学习框架在多个多模态基准测试中表现出色，超过了强基线，提高了MEGA-Bench和MathVista的性能。此外，SPECS有助于减少分布内“卡住”现象，提高探索能力，稳定训练并提升性能上限。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探讨知识蒸馏对模型在面对虚假相关性时的鲁棒性的影响，并研究如何改进去偏方法的可蒸馏性。

Method: 本文通过大量实验研究了知识蒸馏对模型在自然语言推理和图像分类任务中转移“去偏”能力的影响，并分析了KD对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 研究发现了几个关键结果：(i) 模型的去偏能力在KD后被削弱；(ii) 训练去偏模型不会从注入教师知识中受益；(iii) 虽然模型的整体鲁棒性可能保持稳定，但不同类型的偏差可能会有显著变化；(iv) 作者指出了导致KD后行为差异的内部注意力模式和电路。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果表明，知识蒸馏（KD）可能会削弱模型的去偏能力，并揭示了其内部机制。基于这些发现，作者提出了三种改进去偏方法可蒸馏性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何视角来理解Transformer模型中的参数记忆，发现模型能够合成全局关系的几何结构，这为改进Transformer记忆提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将参数记忆抽象为局部共现关系的查找，但这种方法无法解释模型如何处理非共现实体之间的关系。本文旨在探索一种新的几何视角，以更好地理解Transformer模型的记忆机制。

Method: 本文通过分析Transformer模型在序列建模中的表现，对比了传统的关联视角和几何视角，提出了模型通过合成几何结构来编码全局关系的假设，并通过与Node2Vec的联系分析了这种几何结构的来源。

Result: 研究发现，Transformer模型能够合成一种优雅的几何结构，即使在没有明显优化压力的情况下也能自然形成。这种几何结构使得复杂的推理任务变得更简单，并且为改进Transformer记忆提供了可见的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种几何视角来理解Transformer模型中的参数记忆，认为模型通过合成自己的几何结构来编码全局关系，而不仅仅是局部共现关系。这种几何结构使得复杂的推理任务变得更简单，并且即使在没有明显优化压力的情况下也能自然形成。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL微调方法在稳定性方面存在问题，这是由于训练和推理策略之间的数值不匹配引起的。

Method: 通过将精度从BF16改为FP16，简单地解决了训练和推理策略之间的数值不匹配问题。

Result: 使用FP16可以消除这种不匹配，从而提高优化的稳定性、收敛速度和性能。

Conclusion: 使用FP16可以更稳定地优化，更快地收敛，并在各种任务、算法和框架中表现出更强的性能。我们希望这些发现能促使更广泛地重新考虑RL微调中的精度权衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT
benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的主观评估方法SP-MCQA，并发布了一个大规模数据集，以评估合成语音的关键信息准确性。实验发现，低WER并不能保证高可理解性，说明现有评估标准存在不足，需要更贴近现实的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法主要依赖于词对词的准确度指标（如WER），这些指标无法捕捉现实世界语音的复杂性或反映人类的理解需求。

Method: 本文提出了Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering（SP-MCQA）方法，这是一种新颖的主观评估方法，用于评估合成语音中的关键信息准确性，并发布了SP-MCQA-Eval数据集进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，低WER并不一定保证高关键信息准确度，揭示了传统指标与实际可理解性之间的差距。SP-MCQA显示，即使是最先进的模型在文本规范化和发音准确性方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 本文强调了当前许多系统在WER上表现优异，但在实际语音可理解性方面可能仍存在不足，迫切需要更高层次、更贴近现实的评估标准。

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FakeZero is a client-side browser extension that flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X while the user scrolls. It uses a three-stage training curriculum and achieves high accuracy with low latency, making it a feasible solution for detecting fake news under tight resource budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse.

Method: FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum: baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss, adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation.

Result: The DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1% macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to 14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms.

Conclusion: FakeZero can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of misinformation across social networks. With user consent, it also opens the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection techniques.

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the

Motivation: LLM代理的规划和工具调用能力带来了新的安全风险，因此需要一个全面的红队系统来发现漏洞并确保其安全部署。

Method: SIRAJ采用动态两步过程，首先生成多样化的种子测试用例，然后基于先前尝试的执行轨迹迭代构建和优化模型基础的对抗攻击。此外，还引入了模型蒸馏方法，以结构化形式训练更小但同样有效的模型。

Result: 种子测试用例生成方法在风险结果和工具调用轨迹的覆盖率上提升了2-2.5倍，而8B的蒸馏红队模型攻击成功率提高了100%，超过了671B的Deepseek-R1模型。

Conclusion: SIRAJ框架在多种评估代理设置中表现出色，能够有效提升风险结果和工具调用轨迹的覆盖率，并通过模型蒸馏方法实现高效的红队模型。

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前水印解决方案难以解决信任问题：水印检测无法公开证明其自身正确执行。这是因为水印检测中使用的密钥通常是保密的，这可能导致攻击者发起移除攻击；或者如果密钥是私有的，水印检测对公众来说是不透明的。

Method: PVMark基于零知识证明（ZKP），通过构建一系列ZKP约束条件，包括映射、随机数生成、比较和求和，实现水印检测过程的公开验证。

Result: PVMark在Python、Rust和Circom中实现了多种变体，覆盖了三种水印方案、三种哈希函数和四种ZKP协议，实验结果表明该方法在各种情况下都能有效工作。

Conclusion: PVMark有效地实现了对最先进的LLM水印方案的公开验证，同时不损害水印性能，有望在实践中部署。

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DySQL-Bench，一个用于评估模型在动态交互场景下性能的新基准，展示了当前模型在处理多轮查询时的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL模型在真实世界交互场景中表现不佳，需要评估模型在用户意图变化时的适应能力。

Method: 通过自动化两阶段流程生成任务并进行验证，使用结构化树表示从原始数据库表中引导LLM任务生成，并进行面向交互的过滤和专家验证。

Result: DySQL-Bench涵盖了13个领域，共1,072个任务，即使GPT-4o也仅达到58.34%的整体准确率和23.81%的Pass@5指标。

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench展示了模型在动态交互场景下的挑战，并揭示了当前模型在处理多轮查询时的不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种人-LLM协作框架，用于从仅标签注释中推断思维轨迹，并通过拒绝采样方法大规模重建这些轨迹。这些推断的思维轨迹被应用于两个互补任务：微调开放LLM评分者和合成更清晰的专有LLM评分者的标注指南。实验结果表明，这些方法显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性，并增强了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地被用作评估任务的评分者。然而，它们在主观任务中的可靠性往往有限，当人类判断涉及超越标注标签的细微推理时。思维轨迹是高度信息丰富的，但难以收集和整理。

Method: 我们提出了一种人-LLM协作框架，从仅标签注释中推断思维轨迹。所提出的框架使用一种简单而有效的拒绝采样方法大规模重建这些轨迹。

Result: 我们的方法在多个数据集上显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性。此外，改进的标注指南增加了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，LLMs可以作为实际的代理，以揭示原本无法显现的人类思维轨迹，使仅包含标签的语料库扩展为增强LLM评分器可靠性的思维轨迹增强资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为推理课程的两阶段强化学习方法，用于在大型语言模型中激发和提升通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习可以激发大型语言模型的强推理能力，但大多数公开努力集中在数学和代码上。需要一种更通用的推理方法。

Method: 提出了一种简单的两阶段课程，首先在预训练对齐的领域（如数学）中激发推理技能，然后通过联合强化学习在其他领域适应和精炼这些技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B上进行的多领域套件评估显示，推理课程带来了持续的提升。消融实验和认知技能分析表明，两个阶段都是必要的，并且数学优先的激发增加了解决复杂问题的重要认知行为。

Conclusion: 推理课程提供了一种简洁且易于采用的通用推理方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ToolRM，一种轻量级生成式奖励模型，适用于通用工具使用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门设计用于函数调用任务的奖励模型限制了更强大代理AI的进步。

Method: 我们提出了一个新颖的管道，使用基于规则的评分和多维采样构建成对偏好数据。

Result: 在ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集上训练的Qwen3-4B/8B系列模型在成对奖励判断中表现出色，比Claude 4和OpenAI o3等前沿模型高出14.28%。

Conclusion: 我们释放了数据和模型检查点以促进未来的研究。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在各种推理任务中表现出色，但它们处理规范推理的能力仍缺乏深入研究。本文旨在系统评估大型语言模型在规范领域的推理能力，并探讨其在规范推理中的表现和挑战。

Method: 本文从逻辑和模态角度系统评估了大型语言模型在规范领域的推理能力。为了评估大型语言模型如何处理规范模态，我们比较了它们在规范模态和具有共同形式结构的认识模态方面的推理。为此，我们引入了一个新的数据集，涵盖了规范和认识领域中的广泛形式推理模式，同时还包含了影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: 研究结果表明，尽管大型语言模型通常遵循有效的推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中表现出明显的不一致，并表现出与人类推理心理研究中观察到的认知偏差相似的偏差。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，尽管大型语言模型通常遵循有效的推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中表现出明显的不一致，并表现出与人类推理心理研究中观察到的认知偏差相似的偏差。这些发现突显了在大型语言模型的规范推理中实现逻辑一致性所面临的挑战，并为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are
released publicly at https://github.com/kmineshima/NeuBAROCO.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.
