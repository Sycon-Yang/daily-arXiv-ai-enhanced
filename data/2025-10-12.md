### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过构建包含140,750张百度和腾讯街景图像和984,024条微博社交媒体文本的数据集，开发了一种反应指数来分析北京二环地区的情感变化，并揭示了感知和意见情感反应的趋势以及它们与城市元素的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，带来了嵌入在人类感知和意见中的细微情感反应变化，挑战了现有的多维情感分析方法。

Method: 研究开发了一种反应指数，结合了目标检测和自然语言处理技术，对北京二环地区的2016年和2022年的情感进行分类，并利用回归分析、图像分割和基于土地利用分布的词频分析对分类的情感反应进行分析和可视化。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示积极情感更加均匀分布，而意见情感反应趋势图显示更极端的变化。不匹配图表明了多年来城市环境中人类感知和意见情感之间的显著差异。情感反应的变化与密集建筑和行人存在等因素有显著关系。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市环境中感知和意见情感反应的变化，并提出了潜在的环境管理和城市更新策略。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出HaystackCraft基准，用于评估长上下文模型在嘈杂和动态环境下的表现，强调了代理式长上下文推理中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代长上下文大型语言模型（LLMs）在合成的“针在haystack”（NIAH）基准上表现良好，但这些测试忽略了从有偏检索和代理工作流中产生的嘈杂上下文。需要进行haystack engineering来构建能忠实捕捉关键现实因素的嘈杂长上下文，以测试模型的长上下文鲁棒性。

Method: 通过HaystackCraft，一个基于完整英文维基百科超链接网络的新NIAH基准，来实例化 haystack engineering。HaystackCraft评估了异构检索策略如何影响干扰物组成、haystack排序和下游LLM性能，并进一步扩展NIAH到动态、LLM依赖的设置以模拟代理操作。

Result: 实验显示，更强的密集检索器可能会引入更具挑战性的干扰物，而基于图的重新排序同时提高了检索效果并减轻了更有害的干扰物；在代理测试中，即使是先进的模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-5也会因自生成的干扰物而出现级联失败或难以进行早期停止。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了在代理式长上下文推理中的持续挑战，并确立了HaystackCraft作为未来进步的有价值测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文词元化任务中的表现，并发现它们在大多数语言中通过直接生成词元而达到了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究大型语言模型在上下文词元化任务中的表现，并与传统方法进行比较。

Method: 本文通过实验证明了最新一代大型语言模型在上下文词元化任务中的能力，并将其与传统的完全监督方法进行了比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管编码器在微调后在域外设置中仍然具有竞争力，但当前的大型语言模型在大多数语言中通过直接在上下文中生成词元而达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，当前的大型语言模型在没有先前微调的情况下，仅提供少量示例即可在上下文中直接生成词元，从而在大多数语言中达到了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于大语言模型的评分标准LASER，可以更公平地评估语音识别结果，并展示了其在多种印度语言中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ASR评估指标如WER在评估语音识别结果时，可能会不公平地惩罚那些不显著改变句子语义的句法和形态学差异。

Method: LASER利用了最先进的大语言模型的上下文学习能力，通过带有详细示例的提示来学习。此外，还展示了如何微调较小的LLM来预测应施加的惩罚。

Result: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro进行的Hindi LASER评分与人工标注的相关性高达94%。Hindi示例在分析其他印度语言（如Marathi、Kannada和Malayalam）的错误时也有效。此外，还展示了如何微调较小的LLM以接近89%的准确率预测应施加的惩罚。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的评分标准LASER，能够更好地评估语音识别结果，减少对句法和形态学细微差别的不公平惩罚。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了有意义地评估手语表达，我们需要一种实用且可重复的方法来开发和评估手语翻译或生成系统。

Method: 关键点距离-based、嵌入-based 和反向翻译-based 度量方法。通过自动元评估和人类相关性研究，分析了不同度量方法在不同场景下的权衡。

Result: 我们展示了不同度量方法在不同场景下的权衡，并提供了开源的姿态评估工具包。

Conclusion: 我们的研究和开源姿态评估工具包为开发和评估手语翻译或生成系统提供了实用且可重复的方法。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究展示了一种基于特定领域提示策略的思维链方法，使大型语言模型能够准确识别民粹主义内容，效果与专家人类编码器相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量民粹主义的思想内容仍然是一个挑战。传统的基于文本分析的方法虽然有效，但成本高、耗时且难以跨语言、情境和大规模语料库扩展。

Method: 使用基于评分和锚点引导的思维链（CoT）提示方法，模仿人类编码员的培训过程。利用全球民粹主义数据库（GPD）进行模型训练和测试。

Result: 该方法使大型语言模型能够实现与专家人类编码器相当的分类准确性，证明了其在处理民粹主义的细微和上下文敏感方面的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过特定领域提示策略，大型语言模型可以达到与专家人类编码器相当的分类准确性，证明了其在处理民粹主义的细微和上下文敏感方面的能力。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade 是一种高效的 TTS 框架，通过异步和解耦的方法消除了顺序依赖，提高了服务效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 TTS 方法在高并发和长 CoT 场景下受到顺序依赖的页面过滤和粗粒度标记选择的限制，导致服务效率和模型性能下降。

Method: AsyncSpade 采用两个核心组件：(1) 一种轻量级的时间回归模块，用于预测下一个标记的查询状态；(2) 一种异步和解耦的框架，将 KV 缓存过滤与自回归解码循环解耦，通过异步性将标记级别的 KV 选择与前向推理计算重叠。

Result: AsyncSpade 在 A100 节点上验证了其有效性，能够完全将 KV 缓存操作与推理流水线重叠，实现理论上的最优输出标记时间 (TPOT)。具体来说，AsyncSpade 相比 SoTA 基线 (即 Quest) 将 TPOT 减少了 20% 以上，并且相比完整注意力机制在 Qwen3-8B 和 Qwen3-32B 模型上实现了至少 50% 的 TPOT 减少，同时在各种 TTS 基准测试中保持或超越了其准确性。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade 是第一个在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除顺序依赖性的框架，它在各种 TTS 基准测试中表现出色，包括 AIME-24/25、GPQA-Diamond 和 MATH-500。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多智能体系统中团队动态的结构、多样性和互动，发现扁平化团队表现优于层级化团队，多样性对性能的影响复杂，同时揭示了代理在合作中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体系统（MAS）与大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的代理正在获得关注，但较少有研究探讨它们的团队动态。受人类团队科学的启发，本研究旨在探索团队科学的核心方面。

Method: 研究提出了一种多智能体框架，用于检查团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态。通过四个任务评估团队性能：CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa 和 Latent Implicit Hate，涵盖了常识和社交推理。

Result: 研究结果表明，扁平化团队的表现优于层级化团队，而多样性对性能的影响较为复杂。访谈显示代理对团队表现过于自信，但任务后的反思揭示了对合作的欣赏以及整合过程中的挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 研究发现，扁平化团队在任务表现上优于层级化团队，而多样性对性能的影响较为复杂。此外，虽然代理对团队表现过于自信，但任务后的反思显示了对合作的欣赏以及在整合过程中遇到的挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

TL;DR: 本文研究了链式思维微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，并提出了一种基于熵的指标'问题完整性'来优化模型开始推理的时间。此外，还使用了直接偏好优化（DPO）方法来进一步优化准确率-延迟前沿，实现了70%的延迟减少且不损失准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管语音大语言模型在语音交互方面取得了进展，但它们在复杂推理任务上仍存在困难。因此，需要一种方法来提高这些模型的推理能力并减少响应延迟。

Method: 本文研究了链式思维微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，并提出了一种基于熵的指标'问题完整性'来优化模型开始推理的时间。此外，还使用了直接偏好优化（DPO）方法来进一步优化准确率-延迟前沿。

Result: 实验结果表明，文本空间中的推理可以将语音大语言模型的准确性提高2.4倍。此外，基于'问题完整性'的方法在相同延迟条件下可使ARC-Easy的准确性提高4%。最后，使用DPO方法实现了70%的延迟减少且不损失准确率。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入基于熵的指标'问题完整性'和使用直接偏好优化（DPO）方法，显著提高了多流语音大语言模型在准确率和延迟之间的权衡，实现了70%的延迟减少且不损失准确率。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ToTAL的框架，通过思维模板增强长上下文语言模型，以提高多跳推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的长上下文语言模型（LCLMs）可以处理数以万计的标记，为知识密集型多跳推理提供了新的机会，但简单地将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法捕捉证据应如何连接。

Method: 我们提出了一个更新策略，通过自然语言反馈迭代优化从训练数据中得出的思维模板。

Result: 我们的方法在基于检索和无检索设置中都取得了显著的改进，并且优化的模板可以被提炼成较小的开源模型。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多种基准测试和LCLM家族中都超过了强大的基线，展示了其广泛适用性和透明的推理重用。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

Result: 本文提出的模型在不同领域中取得了较高的chrF++和归一化CER分数，分别为87.91和0.05（从波斯语到塔吉克语）以及92.28和0.04（从塔吉克语到波斯语）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的最先进的序列到序列模型，用于塔吉克语和波斯语之间的音译，并提供了两个自己的数据集。结果表明，该模型在不同领域中表现良好，为任务提供了更清晰的理解，并设定了全面的基准。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模型OWL和一个长上下文基准LongSpecBench，解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文场景下的性能问题，并通过三种创新方法实现了显著的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在实际应用中表现不佳，特别是在处理长上下文时性能显著下降。因此，需要一种新的方法和基准来推动研究进展。

Method: 本文引入了OWL模型，通过三种创新方法提高长上下文场景下的推理速度：(1) 基于LSTM的drafter仅基于最后一个token状态进行条件判断；(2) 在verifier中引入特殊标记[SPEC]以生成更丰富的表示；(3) 结合树解码和非树解码方法的混合算法。

Result: OWL模型在长上下文输入上的接受长度比EAGLE3高出约5倍，表明其在长上下文场景下的优越性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了OWL模型和LongSpecBench基准，以解决现有方法在长上下文场景下的性能问题，并通过三种创新实现了显著的改进。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种成本效益高的评估方法，通过多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习，使小型模型在图表理解任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的小型模型（<=2B参数）在作为图表理解任务的自动评估者时表现不佳，这限制了它们在资源受限环境中的实际应用。因此，我们需要一种成本效益高的评估方法。

Method: 我们提出了两种方法：多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习。多标准提示将不同的评估标准结合到一个查询中，而领域自适应迁移学习则是在图表数据集上对2B参数的LVLM进行微调，以创建ChartJudge。

Result: 实验表明，多标准提示暴露了模型的脆弱性，导致7B模型的性能大幅下降，包括专门的LVLM评估者如LLaVA-Critic。此外，我们的小型LVLM（ChartJudge）能够有效地从一个数据集转移到另一个数据集，使其成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，通过多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习，可以有效地在资源受限的环境中使用小型模型进行图表理解任务的评估。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文研究了预微调策略以增强轻量级BERT-like编码器对两个基本NLP任务家族的适应性，并提出了一个基于任务优先LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，该框架在保持实际部署约束的同时，性能与单独预微调相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言处理（NLP）模型部署在移动平台上需要能够在不同应用中适应同时保持内存和计算效率的模型。我们研究了预微调策略，以增强轻量级BERT-like编码器对两个基本NLP任务家族的适应性：命名实体识别（NER）和文本分类。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于任务优先LoRA模块的简单而有效的多任务预微调框架，这使得一个共享的编码器主干和模块化适配器得以实现。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在保持实际部署约束的同时，性能与单独预微调相当。对于NER平均提高了+0.8%，对于文本分类平均提高了+8.8%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在21个下游任务上的实验显示，对于NER平均提高了+0.8%，对于文本分类平均提高了+8.8%，证明了该方法在多功能移动NLP应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

TL;DR: 本研究通过计算语言学分析，发现新冠疫情错误信息在可读性和语言使用上与事实性内容存在显著差异，这可能有助于错误信息检测和公共卫生信息策略的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在通过计算语言学方法识别疫情相关在线话语中错误信息的语言特征，以帮助检测错误信息并改进公共卫生信息策略。

Method: 本研究基于三个语料库：新冠疫情虚假叙述（n = 7588）、一般新冠疫情内容（n = 10700）和猴痘相关帖子（n = 5787），分析了可读性、修辞标志和说服性语言使用方面的显著差异。

Result: 研究发现，新冠疫情错误信息表现出较低的可读性分数和更高的恐惧相关或说服性术语频率，同时较少使用感叹号，与猴痘相关内容的更具情感色彩的风格形成对比。这些模式表明，错误信息采用了一种刻意复杂的修辞风格，结合了情感线索，可能增强其可信度。

Conclusion: 本研究通过计算语言学分析，揭示了疫情相关在线话语中语言如何区分健康错误信息与事实性沟通。研究发现，错误信息表现出较低的可读性分数和更高的恐惧相关或说服性术语频率，这可能增强了其可信度。研究结果有助于数字健康错误信息检测，并为公共卫生信息策略和危机传播理论模型提供参考。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望这些工具能有趣地用于创建人工构造语言，并探索LLMs对语言的理解能力。

Method: 该系统首先使用代理方法创建目标音系，然后将句子翻译成形态句法标记，从中构建词典，并提供一种书写系统和语法手册。

Result: 不同LLMs和语言规范之间的能力差距较大，处理常见模式比处理罕见模式更容易。此外，该方法在高资源到低资源语言的翻译任务中的结果目前主要是负面的。

Conclusion: 该系统可以用于创建人工构造语言，并且可以探索LLMs对语言的理解能力。此外，该方法可能在高资源到低资源语言的翻译任务中有所应用。

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过表示相似性分析，研究了语言模型输入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、语法和频率度量的关系，发现词汇嵌入在训练过程中迅速收敛到与语义和语法特征的高度相关性，高频和功能词的嵌入比低频词更快收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们想了解语言模型的输入词汇表示是如何结构化的，以及这种结构如何以及何时在训练过程中演变。

Method: 我们使用表示相似性分析，运行了一系列实验，将两个开源模型（Pythia 12B 和 OLMo 7B）的输入嵌入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、语法和频率度量相关联。

Result: 1) 在训练过程中，词汇嵌入几何迅速收敛到与一系列语义和语法特征的高度相关性；2) 高频和功能词（例如“the”，“of”）的嵌入比词汇和低频词更快地收敛到最终向量，这些词仍保留一些与随机初始化偏差的对齐。

Conclusion: 我们的发现有助于映射输入嵌入围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，揭示了词频和功能的不同作用。这些发现促使我们更深入地研究词汇几何演变如何在模型训练过程中促进特定能力的提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过临床代码验证和轻量级干预来提高基于LLM的医疗编码的准确性，并发布了一个新的基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的临床编码对于医疗文档、计费和决策至关重要，但现有的LLM在这一任务上表现不佳，尤其是在层次结构接近但错误的情况下。

Method: 我们引入了临床代码验证作为独立任务和管道组件，并通过提示工程和小规模微调等轻量级干预来改进准确性。

Result: 轻量级干预可以提高准确性，而无需搜索方法的计算开销。此外，我们发布了一个专家双标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集，以解决现有数据集的局限性。

Conclusion: 我们的结果强调了验证作为提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效且可靠步骤。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Motivation: 大型语言模型常常模糊角色边界，产生不受限制的响应。因此，需要研究角色条件下的拒绝行为，以确保遵循访问控制策略。

Method: 本文创建了一个扩展的Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集，其中包含了真实的PostgreSQL基于角色的策略。比较了三种设计：(i) 零次或少量提示，(ii) 两步生成器-验证器管道，(iii) LoRA微调模型。

Result: 显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可，而微调模型在安全性和实用性之间取得了更好的平衡。更长和更复杂的策略会降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个新颖的数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在角色条件下的拒绝能力，并比较了三种设计方法。结果表明，显式验证可以提高拒绝精度并降低错误许可，而微调模型在安全性和实用性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Method: Ryt AI is an LLM-native agentic framework powered by ILMU, a closed-source LLM developed internally. It uses four LLM-powered agents (Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ) to replace rigid multi-screen workflows with a single dialogue.

Result: Ryt AI provides a secure and compliant way to perform core financial operations through natural language conversation, demonstrating the potential of conversational AI in banking.

Conclusion: Ryt AI demonstrates that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably support core financial operations under strict governance.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory

closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最优大脑损伤理论的缓存驱逐框架OBCache，通过量化token显著性来提高长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缓存驱逐方法通常使用累积注意力权重来启发式地对tokens进行排序，但没有考虑它们对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: OBCache通过将缓存驱逐问题形式化为逐层结构化剪枝问题，量化了通过修剪tokens引起的注意力输出扰动来衡量token显著性，并为孤立的键、孤立的值和联合键值对推导出闭式分数。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，使用OBCache的输出感知分数替代现有工作中的启发式分数可以提高长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: 实验表明，将现有工作中估计token显著性的启发式分数替换为OBCache的输出感知分数可以持续提高长上下文准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of natural language inference (NLI) as an alternative to token probability (TP) metrics for measuring social bias in language models. The study finds that NLI and TP metrics behave differently, with NLI being more effective at detecting certain types of bias but also more sensitive to wording. The authors conclude that a combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations is needed for a comprehensive assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized for their distance from real-world language model use cases and harms.

Method: We test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative bias metric.

Result: We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more likely to detect 'underdebiased' cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP approaches.

Conclusion:  neither token probability nor natural language inference is a 'better' bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive evaluation of language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the harmony of the web. Existing hate speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations. Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.

Method: CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders, thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues. Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style within the latent space.

Result: CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

Conclusion: CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

Result: 在 Language Model Personalization (LaMP) 基准测试中，MemWeaver 的有效性得到了验证。

Conclusion: MemWeaver 通过构建行为记忆和认知记忆的双组件记忆结构，有效捕捉了用户兴趣的时间演变和语义关系，从而实现了更深层次的个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

TL;DR: SubQRAG is a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth for complex multi-hop question answering by decomposing questions into verifiable sub-questions and dynamically expanding the knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) in complex multi-hop question answering, which often lacks deep structured reasoning and leads to incomplete evidence and error accumulation.

Method: SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions and dynamically expands the graph by extracting new triples from source documents in real time.

Result: Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Conclusion: SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Motivation: 现有的多语言知识图谱补全研究未能充分利用大型语言模型的多语言能力，并忽略了跨语言知识的共享性。

Method: 本文提出了两种组件：知识级分组专家混合（KL-GMoE）和迭代实体重新排序（IER），以有效地建模和利用跨语言知识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

Motivation: 解决在小规模架构中模型无法生成准确响应的问题，以及GRPO方法中的训练崩溃问题。

Method: 提出了ToolExpander框架，通过两个关键创新：(1) 动态多轮硬采样，(2) 自我示例思考，以增强工具导向的强化学习。

Result: ToolExpander显著提高了LLMs的工具使用能力，尤其是在小规模模型中，提升了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ToolExpander显著增强了LLMs的工具使用能力，特别是在较弱的小规模模型中，提高了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了OpenRubrics和Contrastive Rubric Generation（CRG）方法，用于生成更可靠和可扩展的评分标准，从而提高奖励模型的性能，并在多个任务中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型主要依赖于标量或成对的判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多方面性质。尽管最近的研究探索了作为奖励的评分标准（RaR），但生成可靠且可扩展的评分标准仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 我们引入了OpenRubrics，这是一个多样化、大规模的（提示，评分标准）对集合，用于训练评分标准生成和基于评分标准的奖励模型。我们还引入了对比评分标准生成（CRG），通过对比首选和拒绝的响应来推导出硬规则和原则。我们进一步通过拒绝抽样来确保偏好标签的一致性，以去除噪声评分标准。

Result: 我们的基于评分标准的奖励模型Rubric-RM在多个奖励建模基准测试中超过了强大的大小匹配基线，提升了6.8%。这些收益转移到了指令遵循和生物医学基准测试中的策略模型。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，评分标准提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵的人类评估和自动化奖励建模之间的差距，使基于原则的新范式成为可能。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过引入新的采样策略和聚合方法，使隐式推理模型能够实现并行测试时缩放（TTS），从而为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管隐式推理在连续向量空间中提供了比显式链式思维更高效的替代方案，但目前尚不清楚这些模型是否能从并行TTS中受益，主要是因为缺乏连续空间中的采样机制和高级轨迹聚合的概率信号。

Method: 本研究引入了两种基于不确定性的随机策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和加性高斯噪声用于采样，并设计了一个使用逐步对比目标训练的隐式奖励模型（LatentRM）用于聚合。

Result: 实验和可视化分析表明，两种采样策略在计算上有效，并表现出不同的探索动态，而LatentRM实现了有效的轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 本研究通过解决连续空间中的采样机制和概率信号缺失问题，使隐式推理模型能够实现并行测试时缩放（TTS）。实验和可视化分析表明，两种采样策略在计算上有效，并表现出不同的探索动态，而LatentRM实现了有效的轨迹选择。这为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

TL;DR: 研究显示，尽管大型语言模型在仅选项输入下取得成功，但它们可能使用了更合理的策略，而不是浅显的捷径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在多项选择题回答任务中表现出色，但存在担忧，即它们可能并未按预期解决问题，而是在仅使用选项的情况下取得成功。这种部分输入的成功通常被认为是有问题的，但推理轨迹可能揭示这些策略是否真的浅显。

Method: 通过让推理大语言模型在完整和仅选项输入下解决多项选择题，研究这些策略。

Result: 测试时的推理经常在完整输入和仅选项输入中提高准确性，但仅选项输入的成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度的影响，并且在通过忠实性测试后，我们展示了它们使用了较少有问题的策略，如推断缺失的问题。

Conclusion: 我们挑战了部分输入成功总是缺陷的主张，讨论了推理痕迹如何区分有问题的数据和不太有问题的推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: 由于领域特定工具的稀缺性，工具增强的推理方法在广泛采用中受到阻碍。例如，在物理问题回答等领域，合适的专用工具通常缺失。虽然最近的工作探索了通过从思维链（CoT）推理轨迹中提取可重用函数来自动化工具创建，但这些方法面临关键的可扩展性瓶颈。随着生成工具数量的增长，存储在无结构集合中的工具会导致显著的检索挑战，包括扩展的搜索空间和功能相关工具之间的歧义。

Method: 我们提出了一种系统的方法，将无结构的工具集合自动重构为结构化的工具库。首先生成离散的任务特定工具，并将它们聚类到语义连贯的主题中。在每个聚类中，引入多智能体框架来整合分散的功能：代码代理重构代码以提取共享逻辑并创建多功能的聚合工具，而审查代理确保这些聚合工具保持原始工具集的完整功能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个推理任务中显著提高了工具检索准确率和整体推理性能，并且在问题特定工具数量增加时表现出更好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Motivation: 我们发现，基于结果的奖励方法容易受到奖励黑客攻击，导致模型推理能力被严重高估。

Method: 我们引入了评分标准奖励模型（RRM），这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，它根据特定于问题的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹。

Result: RRM-based训练在四个数学基准测试中始终优于仅基于结果的监督。值得注意的是，它将AIME2024的Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提高到62.6%，并将奇迹步骤的发生率降低了71%。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，奖励解决过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种旋转约束补偿方法，用于解决大型语言模型剪枝引起的误差。通过在旋转约束下更新参数，保留输出表示的几何结构，并设计方差感知重要性评分以保留关键维度。实验结果显示该方法优于现有基线。


<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在大量数据上训练，积累了丰富的语义知识。然而，剪枝通常只使用少量校准数据，导致输出不匹配不可避免。直接最小二乘拟合虽然可以减少这些误差，但容易过拟合到有限的校准集，破坏预训练权重。

Method: 我们提出了一种旋转约束补偿方法，以解决结构化剪枝引入的误差。该方法在旋转约束下更新剪枝参数，保留输出表示的几何结构，并重新对齐剪枝子空间与原始输出。此外，我们设计了一个方差感知的重要性评分，以确保具有高方差的输入维度被优先保留。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在困惑度和任务准确性方面优于现有基线。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

TL;DR: LLM4Cell是对用于单细胞研究的58个基础和代理模型的首次统一调查，提供了语言驱动的单细胞智能的综合视图，并指出了可解释性、标准化和可信模型开发方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）和新兴的代理框架正在开始通过启用自然语言推理、生成注释和多模态数据集成来改变单细胞生物学。然而，进展在数据模态、架构和评估标准方面仍然碎片化。

Method: LLM4Cell对58个用于单细胞研究的基础和代理模型进行了首次统一调查，涵盖了RNA、ATAC、多组学和空间模态，并将这些方法分为五个家族：基础、文本桥梁、空间、多模态、表观基因组和代理，并将其映射到八个关键分析任务。

Result: LLM4Cell分析了超过40个公共数据集，分析了基准适用性、数据多样性以及伦理或可扩展性约束，并在10个领域维度上评估了模型，涵盖生物基础、多组学对齐、公平性、隐私和可解释性。

Conclusion: LLM4Cell提供了第一个语言驱动的单细胞智能的综合视图，并概述了可解释性、标准化和可信模型开发方面的开放挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,
generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress
remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation
standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and
agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC,
multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five
families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and
agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,
privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation
domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven
single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability,
standardization, and trustworthy model development.

*Peilin Wu,Mian Zhang,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao,Kaiyu He,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HiPRAG的训练方法，通过引入细粒度、基于知识的过程奖励来改进agentic RAG技术，从而提高搜索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的训练方法通常依赖于基于结果的奖励，在强化学习框架中缺乏解决这些低效问题所需的细粒度控制。

Method: 本文提出了HiPRAG训练方法，该方法在强化学习训练中引入了细粒度、基于知识的过程奖励。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在七个不同的QA基准测试中平均准确率分别为65.4%（3B）和67.2%（7B）。同时，提高了搜索效率，将过度搜索率降低到仅2.3%，并同时降低了不足搜索率。

Conclusion: 本文展示了通过强化学习进行细粒度控制的重要性与潜力，以提高搜索代理的效率和最优性。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)的新框架，用于生成任务自适应的通信拓扑，通过迭代构建过程实现高效、稀疏的拓扑结构，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个最优的通信拓扑是一个非平凡的挑战，因为需要平衡任务性能、通信成本和鲁棒性等竞争目标。现有的框架通常依赖静态或手工制作的拓扑，无法适应多样化的任务需求，导致简单问题的过多token消耗或复杂问题的性能瓶颈。

Method: 引入了一种称为Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)的新型生成框架，该框架受到条件离散图扩散模型的启发，将拓扑合成作为迭代构建过程。在每一步中，生成由一个轻量级代理模型引导，该模型预测多目标奖励（例如准确性、效用、成本），从而实现实时、无梯度优化以达到任务自适应的拓扑。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了GTD，实验表明该框架可以生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，在LLM代理协作中表现优异。

Conclusion: GTD可以生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，在LLM代理协作中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MGR-CSC的新框架，用于多语言生成检索，解决了跨语言标识符错位和标识符膨胀的问题，并在多个数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成信息检索方法在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符错位和标识符膨胀的问题，需要一种新的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: MGR-CSC通过将语义等效的多语言关键词统一为共享原子来对齐语义并压缩标识符空间，并提出了动态多步骤约束解码策略。

Result: MGR-CSC在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提升了6.83%和4.77%的检索准确率，同时分别减少了74.51%和78.2%的文档标识符长度。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC在多语言检索中表现出色，提高了跨语言对齐并减少了冗余，同时在多个数据集上取得了显著的检索准确率提升。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: AdaSwitch是一种新的知识蒸馏方法，通过动态结合在线和离线策略生成，在保持一致性的同时提供高质量的监督，从而提高小语言模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏方法在离线策略和在线策略之间存在权衡，离线策略提供高质量的监督但引入了训练-推理不匹配，而在线策略保持一致性但依赖于低质量的学生输出。

Method: AdaSwitch是一种动态结合在线策略和离线策略生成的方法，允许学生首先探索自己的预测，然后根据实时质量评估选择性地整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两个教师-学生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch一致地提高了准确性，提供了一种实用且有效的方法来蒸馏SLMs，具有可接受的额外开销。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch是一种有效的方法，可以在保持一致性的同时提供高质量的监督，从而提高小语言模型的准确性。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Conclusion: 本文介绍了Translation Tangles框架和数据集，用于评估开源大型语言模型的翻译质量和公平性，并提出了一个混合偏差检测管道以及一个高质量的偏见标注数据集。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分析大多局限于表面的观察，未能深入探讨LLMs的内部工作机制。因此，本研究旨在填补这一理解上的空白。

Method: 本研究引入了TRACE，一种系统化的LLMs思维过程分析工具，通过分解思维过程、构建思维进展图以及识别常见思维模式来分析过度思考问题。

Result: 研究发现，长思维模型在简单任务上速度慢五到二十倍，且没有显著的准确性提升。同时，发现了两种主要的开放权重思维模式——探索者和晚到者。

Conclusion: 本研究通过分析LLMs的思维过程，揭示了过度思考的主要驱动因素，并提出了基于效用的过度思考定义，为有效管理过度思考提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Motivation: 现有的模型在语言对齐方面存在不足，导致在知识密集型问答和开放式对话中出现不同程度的误解。

Method: 我们提出了数据构造和训练方法来提高语言对齐能力，具体采用了Chain of Recognition (CoR) 和 Keyword Highlighting (KH)。

Result: 我们的方法将知识准确性从25.14% 提高到46.13%，开放性理解率从64.5% 提高到86.5%，并显著减少了次语言的发音错误。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著提高了知识准确性，开放性理解率，并减少了次语言的发音错误。

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation
errors in the secondary language. CS3-Bench is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ConG的新框架，通过对比解码在弱模型之间生成高质量样本，从而提高弱到强泛化的可靠性、去噪和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱到强的泛化方法受到弱模型输出中的噪声和偏差的限制，因此需要一种更可靠的方法来提高其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 我们提出了Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG)，该框架利用对比解码在预对齐和后对齐的弱模型之间生成高质量样本。

Result: 实验结果表明，ConG在不同模型家族中都表现出一致的改进，证明了其普遍性和有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，ConG具有广泛适用性和有效性，为弱到强的泛化提供了一条有希望的通往AGI的道路。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

Motivation: 研究关注的是从标准到非标准方言的跨方言迁移，通常集中在文本数据上。然而，方言主要是口头的，非标准拼写在文本处理中已知会引起问题。

Method: 比较了标准到方言迁移在三种设置中的效果：文本模型、语音模型和级联系统（语音首先被自动转录，然后由文本模型进一步处理）。

Result: 研究发现，仅语音设置在方言数据上表现最佳，而仅文本设置在标准数据上表现最佳。级联系统在德语中落后于仅文本模型，但如果转录系统生成规范化的标准类似输出，它们在方言数据上表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 研究发现，仅语音设置在方言数据上表现最佳，而仅文本设置在标准数据上表现最佳。虽然级联系统在德语中落后于仅文本模型，但如果转录系统生成规范化的标准类似输出，它们在方言数据上表现相对较好。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Motivation: 近期前沿级别的LLM已达到许多以前难以达到的基准，使得进一步区分的空间有限。这种进展突显了需要具有客观验证的挑战性基准的必要性。

Method: 引入MCBench，一个用于评估LLM是否能通过严格遵循逐步指令执行字符串匹配NLP指标的基准。提供并行参考代码以评估LLM输出的准确性，并设计三种评估指标和三种基准变体来测量LLM对详细指令的理解能力。

Result: MCBench能够系统地测试LLM是否能保持准确的逐步执行，包括指令遵循、数值计算和处理中间结果的长距离一致性。

Conclusion: MCBench serves as an effective and objective tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识编辑方法在多跳事实回忆中表现不佳，尤其是在涉及推理链中的隐式主体时。我们需要一种更有效的解决方案来提高多跳知识编辑的性能。

Method: 通过因果分析，我们发现了隐式主体在多跳推理中的作用，并提出了基于神经元级归因的ACE框架来编辑关键的查询-值路径。

Result: ACE框架在GPT-J和Qwen3-8B上分别比最先进的方法提高了9.44%和37.46%。此外，我们还发现了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，并展示了价值神经元的语义可解释性是由查询驱动的累积所协调的。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了多跳知识编辑中的关键问题，并提出了ACE框架，该框架在多个模型上表现出色，为知识编辑提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏方法忽视了不同步骤中需要不同的推理能力，这限制了多步骤检索增强框架的迁移能力。

Method: StepER采用逐步监督来适应不同阶段的信息和推理需求，并结合难度感知训练以逐步优化学习。

Result: StepER在多跳问答基准测试中优于之前的方法，8B模型的表现可与70B教师模型相媲美。

Conclusion: StepER是一种有效的知识蒸馏方法，能够提升多步骤检索增强语言模型的推理能力，并且在多跳问答基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B
teacher model.

*Adam Dejl,James Barry,Alessandra Pascale,Javier Carnerero Cano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了如何评估大型语言模型生成文本的全面性，提出三种自动化评估方法，并发现端到端方法效果最佳，但存在一些局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然在各种任务中表现出色，但经常产生不完整或选择性遗漏关键信息的输出。在敏感领域，这种遗漏可能导致与事实性错误相当的严重危害，包括幻觉。因此，需要一种有效的评估方法来检测缺失信息或被低估的观点。

Method: 研究调查了三种自动评估策略：(1) 基于自然语言推理（NLI）的方法，将文本分解为原子陈述，并使用NLI识别缺失链接；(2) 基于问答的方法，提取问题-答案对并比较不同来源的回答；(3) 端到端方法，直接使用大型语言模型识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明，简单的端到端方法在评估LLM生成文本的全面性方面比更复杂的方法更有效，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。此外，研究还评估了几个流行的开源大模型在回答基于多源信息的用户查询时的全面性。

Conclusion: 研究发现，简单的端到端方法在评估大型语言模型生成文本的全面性方面表现出色，尽管其鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度有所降低。此外，研究还评估了多个流行的开源大模型在回答基于多源信息的用户查询时的全面性。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索大型语言模型在处理17世纪和18世纪爱沙尼亚词典方面的应用，以提高效率和减少成本。

Method: 研究使用了大型语言模型（LLMs）来 enrich 历史词典、进行文本识别以及准备统一的数据集。具体方法包括使用 Claude 3.7 Sonnet 进行词典信息的半自动丰富，使用 zero-shot 方法进行文本识别，以及使用重叠平铺和两个 LLM 进行文本识别和结构合并。

Result: 实验结果表明，Claude 3.7 Sonnet 准确提供了81%的词头条目的意义和现代等价词，zero-shot 方法成功识别并结构化了41%的词头条目，重叠平铺方法用于爱沙尼亚-德语词典部分的数字化。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，即使对于小语言，大型语言模型在节省时间和财务资源方面具有显著潜力。

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with questions that admit multiple valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks assume a single gold answer, which produces inappropriate training signals. Existing attempts to handle ambiguity rely on costly manual annotation, which is difficult to scale.

Method: A$^2$Search is an annotation-free, end-to-end training framework that recognizes and handles ambiguity. It uses an automated pipeline to detect ambiguous questions and gather alternative answers via trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is optimized with RL using a carefully designed AnsF1 reward.

Result: Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks show that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average AnsF1@1 score of 48.4% across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong baselines.

Conclusion: A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is essential for building more reliable QA systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner is a novel framework that uses the difference between a stronger LLM and a weaker SLM to improve the reasoning of LLMs efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether smaller language models (SLMs) can teach larger language models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the latter's unique strength, as traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is resource-intensive and relies on large curated datasets.

Method: LightReasoner is a framework that leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a weaker amateur model (SLM). It operates in two stages: a sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs supervision examples through expert-amateur contrast, and a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these distilled examples.

Result: LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1% across seven mathematical benchmarks, while reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token usage by 99%, without relying on ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: LightReasoner offers a scalable and resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning by turning weaker SLMs into effective teaching signals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社会推理任务中存在认知混乱、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态混淆的问题。

Method: 该研究提出了一个自适应世界模型增强的推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，并动态监控推理轨迹中的困惑指标，及时干预以提供清晰的世界状态描述。

Result: 在三个社会基准测试中，该方法显著提高了准确性（例如Hi-ToM中提高了10%），同时减少了计算成本（最多减少了33.8%的token）。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种增强的推理机制，能够有效解决大型语言模型在社会推理任务中的问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升和计算成本的降低。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图表标题需要准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息。

Method: 我们提出了一个两阶段的管道：第一阶段结合上下文过滤、基于DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA的类别特定提示优化以及标题候选选择；第二阶段应用少量提示与配置文件图进行风格优化。

Result: 实验表明，类别特定的提示优于零样本和通用优化方法，提高了ROUGE-1召回率8.3%，同时将精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少-10.9%。基于配置文件的风格优化带来了BLEU分数40-48%的提升和ROUGE的25-27%的提升。

Conclusion: 我们的系统展示了结合上下文理解和作者特定的风格适应可以生成既科学准确又符合源论文风格的标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在回忆气候常态方面的表现，发现它们在捕捉全球气候模式方面有一定能力，但在高海拔和山区等区域存在显著误差，且无法准确再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的日益普及，了解其内部气候知识对于确保可靠性并评估虚假信息风险至关重要。然而，LLMs回忆气候常态的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 本文构建了一个全球网格的查询，包括1度分辨率的陆地点坐标和位置描述符，并将模型的响应与ERA5再分析数据进行验证。

Result: LLMs能够捕捉纬度和地形模式，但存在3-6摄氏度的均方根误差和±1摄氏度的偏差。在高海拔地区，误差显著增加，达到5-13摄氏度。包含地理上下文（如国家、城市、地区）可以减少27%的误差，而更大的模型对位置描述符更敏感。

Conclusion: 本文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在没有外部检索的情况下回忆气候常态的能力，发现它们能够捕捉非平凡的气候结构，但在高海拔和山区等区域存在显著误差。此外，LLMs虽然能捕捉全球平均温度变化的幅度，但无法再现温度变化的空间模式，这限制了其在气候动态理解中的应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

<details>

Motivation: To address the issues of overfitting under limited client data and forgetting global information after multiple training rounds in existing federated learning methods.

Method: FedDTRE, a Federated adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness Evaluation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of dialogue generation.

Conclusion: FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of dialogue generation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Motivation: 我们想了解人类对多项选择常识基准答案的合理性判断在多大程度上受到（不）合理论据的影响，特别是使用LLM生成的论据。

Method: 我们收集了3000个来自人类的合理性判断和13600个来自LLM的判断，并分析了LLM生成的PRO和CON论据对这些判断的影响。

Result: 我们观察到，在LLM生成的PRO和CON论据存在的情况下，人类的平均合理性评分分别增加和减少，这表明人类评委认为这些论据具有说服力。LLM实验也显示了类似的影响力模式。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，LLM生成的论据可以显著影响人类和LLM对多项选择常识基准答案的合理性判断，这表明LLM在研究人类认知方面有新的应用，但也引发了实际担忧，即即使在人类被认为是“专家”的领域（即常识），LLM也有可能对人们的信念产生重大影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Method: 我们进行了第一个全面的研究，系统评估了LLM推理对商业和开源LLM谈判能力的影响，并在三种语言中进行。我们使用自对弈设置在三种不同的对话游戏中分析性能与成本之间的权衡、推理过程的语言一致性以及模型表现出的战略适应性。

Result: 启用推理显著提高了GPT-5的性能（提高了31.4%），但计算成本增加了近400%。开放权重模型在内部推理步骤中切换到英语，而领先的商业模型保持语言一致性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究发现，启用推理可以显著提高谈判结果，但会带来巨大的计算成本。此外，我们发现开放权重模型在内部推理步骤中会切换到英语，而领先的商业模型则保持推理和最终输出之间的语言一致性。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种理论框架，可以将给定的自回归语言模型转换为具有任意小词汇表的模型，而不会损失准确性。此外，我们展示了不同分词的语言模型可以通过它们的最大公共词汇表高效地相互合作。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

*Haoyang Gui,Thales Bertaglia,Taylor Annabell,Catalina Goanta,Tjomme Dooper,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了影响者营销中赞助内容的检测问题，通过比较两种模型在不同提示策略下的表现，发现它们在分类任务中表现良好，但在模糊案例中表现下降。同时，作者提出了一个推理错误的分类法，并指出添加监管文本可以提高解释质量，但不一定提高检测准确性。文章的贡献包括提供一个分类法、一个原始数据集以及结合定量和定性评估策略的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 影响者营销的兴起模糊了有机内容和赞助内容之间的界限，使得执行与透明度相关的法律规则变得具有挑战性。有效的监管需要应用具有明确目的和理由的法律知识，但目前的未披露赞助内容检测方法通常缺乏法律基础或作为不透明的“黑箱”运行。

Method: 本文使用1,143个Instagram帖子，比较了gpt-5-nano和gemini-2.5-flash-lite在三种提示策略下的表现，这些策略提供了受控水平的法律知识。

Result: 两种模型在将内容分类为赞助或非赞助方面表现强劲（F1高达0.93），但在模糊案例中的表现下降了10多个点。我们进一步开发了一个推理错误的分类法，显示了频繁的引用遗漏（28.57%）、不清楚的参考（20.71%）和隐藏广告表现出最高的错误率（28.57%）。虽然在提示中添加监管文本可以提高解释质量，但它并不总是能提高检测准确性。

Conclusion: 本文的贡献包括：首先，通过提供LLM生成的法律推理中常见错误的分类法，为监管合规技术做出了新颖的贡献，以评估自动化审核不仅准确而且在法律上稳健，从而推进了影响者营销内容的透明检测。其次，它包含了一个原始数据集，该数据集由两名接受过影响者营销法律培训的学生进行注释。第三，它结合了LLM解释的定量和定性评估策略，并批判性地反思了这些发现如何支持广告监管机构在坚实的法律基础上自动化审核过程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从LLM-as-a-Judge中提取基于高阶概念的全局政策的方法，该方法能够生成忠实于LLM决策的全局政策，并且在面对文本扰动和对抗攻击时具有鲁棒性。此外，用户研究显示用户对全局政策的理解和满意度较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM-as-a-Judge被广泛用于增强或替代人工注释，理解其潜在偏见和风险变得至关重要。因此，本文旨在开发一种方法来提取LLM-as-a-Judge的全局政策，以提高透明度和可靠性。

Method: 本文提出了两种算法：CLoVE（对比局部可验证解释）和GloVE（全局可验证解释）。CLoVE生成可验证、基于概念的对比局部解释，而GloVE通过迭代聚类、摘要和验证将局部规则压缩成全局政策。

Result: GloVE在七个标准基准数据集上进行了评估，结果表明提取的全局政策高度忠实于LLM-as-a-Judge的决策。此外，全局政策在面对文本扰动和对抗攻击时表现出良好的鲁棒性。用户研究也显示用户对全局政策的理解和满意度较高。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments.

Method: Genii integrates various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent unsupervisedly.

Result: Genii outperforms supervised models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.

Conclusion: Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Motivation: 由于缺乏公司特定的专用知识库， conversational AI系统在联系中心的集成面临重大障碍。因此，需要一种方法来自动构建知识库，以支持RAG驱动的聊天机器人的部署。

Method: AI Knowledge Assist系统利用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，从历史客户-代理对话中提取问答对，以自动构建公司特定的知识库，并在内部数据上微调轻量级LLM以获得最佳性能。

Result: 在20个公司的实证评估中，AI Knowledge Assist系统利用LLaMA-3.1-8B模型，在回答信息寻求问题方面实现了超过90%的准确率，消除了接触中心的冷启动问题。

Conclusion: AI Knowledge Assist系统能够通过从历史客户-代理对话中提取问答对来自动构建知识库，从而消除接触中心的冷启动问题，并实现超过90%的准确率，使RAG驱动的聊天机器人能够立即部署。

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型LLM的高推理成本，需要使用较小的模型。然而，较小的LLM在跨不同领域上缺乏强大的零样本指令遵循能力，限制了它们对动态用户需求的适应性。传统微调方法加剧了这一问题，导致灾难性遗忘，降低了模型对未见过任务的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，DACIP-RC显著提高了零样本泛化能力，在广泛的商业对话任务中表现优异，包括会议摘要、行动项生成和电话目的识别。

Conclusion: 本文提出了DACIP-RC方法，通过阅读理解生成多样化的任务指令和响应，从而提高小型LLM在商业对话任务中的领域适应性。实验结果表明，DACIP-RC显著提升了零样本泛化能力，并为工业界利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）经常产生虚假拒绝，拒绝包含类似不安全查询的良性请求。我们旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 我们引入了两个全面的基准测试：XSB和MS-XSB，并利用后处理解释方法识别拒绝触发器，部署了三种轻量级、模型无关的方法，包括忽略词指令、提示重写和注意力引导，所有这些都在推理时进行，无需重新训练或参数访问。

Result: 实验表明，这些策略在保持强大的安全保护的同时，显著提高了对安全提示的合规性。基准测试揭示了过度拒绝在各种最近的LLM中持续存在，尤其是在复杂、多轮场景中尤为明显。

Conclusion: 我们的研究建立了一个可重复的框架，用于诊断和减轻过度拒绝问题，突出了更安全和更有帮助的LLM部署的实用途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在简单任务上常常出现“过度思考”问题，现有策略如长度惩罚或路由机制通常是启发式的且任务特定的，缺乏通用框架。

Method: ARM2通过强化学习框架和长度感知优化，实现了推理性能和效率的自适应平衡，并集成了执行代码以降低令牌成本。

Result: ARM2在与传统推理模型相当的性能下，平均减少了70%以上的令牌使用量，并扩展到了多模态应用。

Conclusion: ARM2在保持任务性能的同时，显著减少了令牌使用量，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Motivation: To address the challenges in effectively integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies for LLMs in specialized real-world domains, while avoiding costly parameter updates and overfitting issues.

Method: Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO), which leverages the group relative semantic advantage instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal ground-truth data.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples, Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training data and cost.

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO is a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any parameter updates, and it significantly improves out-of-domain performance with just a few dozen training samples.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型中的记忆检索和巩固机制是当前研究的难点。本文旨在提出一种新的理论框架来解释这些机制。

Method: 本文通过双部图分析和案例研究，验证了功能标记假设。同时，分析了预训练过程中功能标记如何影响模型参数更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，少量的功能标记可以激活大部分特征，并且在预训练过程中，训练损失主要由预测功能标记后的下一个内容标记决定。

Conclusion: 本文提出了功能标记假设，用于解释大型语言模型的工作原理。实验结果支持这一假设，并展示了功能标记在记忆检索和巩固中的作用。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

Motivation: 先前的研究表明，经过恶意或错误完成微调的LLM可能会表现出有害行为，称为涌现性偏差。本研究旨在探讨这种现象是否可以扩展到更广泛的不诚实和欺骗行为。

Method: 我们对开源LLM进行了微调，以处理跨多个领域的错误完成，并在下游组合微调设置以及模拟良性用户和有偏用户的人机交互环境中进行了研究。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在不诚实行为方面表现出广泛偏差。此外，将1%的偏差数据引入标准下游任务足以减少诚实行为超过20%。在模拟人类-AI交互环境中，仅10%的有偏用户群体就可能导致LLM无意中变得更加不诚实。

Conclusion: 我们扩展了对涌现性偏差的研究，将其应用于高风险场景下的不诚实和欺骗领域，并展示了这种风险不仅通过直接微调出现，还在下游混合任务和实际的人机交互中出现。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个包含反因果陈述的新数据集，解决了现有因果抽取数据集忽略反因果陈述的问题，并展示了模型在没有反因果关系的情况下容易将这些陈述误分类为正因果关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果抽取数据集主要关注支持因果关系的陈述（即正因果陈述），而忽略了反驳因果关系的陈述（即反因果陈述）。这导致反因果陈述被错误地标注为正因果陈述。因此，本文旨在解决这一问题，构建一个包含反因果陈述的数据集。

Method: 本文首先通过广泛的文献综述证明了反因果性是不完整知识下因果推理的重要组成部分，然后制定了严格的标注指南，并扩展了Causal News Corpus以包含反因果陈述，从而获得了较高的标注者间一致性。

Result: 通过构建包含反因果陈述的新数据集，模型在没有反因果关系的情况下容易将这些陈述误分类为正因果关系的问题得到了缓解，使得变压器能够有效地区分正因果和反因果关系。

Conclusion: 本文通过构建包含反因果陈述的新数据集，解决了现有因果抽取数据集忽略反因果陈述的问题，并展示了模型在没有反因果关系的情况下容易将这些陈述误分类为正因果关系。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL is a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that improves LLM safety by jointly training a conversation agent and a feedback agent, reducing unsafe responses and overrefusals without degrading general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches often navigate the tension between being helpful and harmless with safeguard models that completely reject any content that contains unsafe portions, which may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance for queries it refuses.

Method: WaltzRL is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. It jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses.

Result: Experiments conducted across five diverse datasets demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses and overrefusals compared to various baselines.

Conclusion: WaltzRL enhances LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在大量文本数据上进行训练，但人们担心这样的数据可能很快达到极限。一种潜在的解决方案是使用从LLMs中采样的合成数据进行训练。本文在此基础上研究了对比解码在生成合成语料库中的优势。

Method: 在受控环境中，我们通过比较一个好模型和一个差模型在相同原始语料库上的表现，实验性地使用相对差异来生成语料库。通过放大性能更好的模型的信号，我们创建了一个合成语料库，并将其与原始训练数据混合。

Result: 训练混合了合成数据和真实数据的模型在语言建模目标和多种下游任务上表现更好。特别是，使用对比解码生成的合成数据在需要更多推理能力的任务上效果更佳，而传统采样生成的合成数据在依赖表面语言能力的任务上效果更佳。

Conclusion: 训练混合了合成数据和真实数据的模型在语言建模目标和各种下游任务上表现更好。特别是，使用对比解码生成的合成数据在需要更多推理能力的任务上更有益，而传统采样生成的合成数据则在依赖表面语言能力的任务上更有帮助。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

Motivation: 现有方法在多轮代理中难以激发深度推理能力，且受限于上下文长度。

Method: 提出 DeepMiner 框架，包括高难度训练任务、动态上下文窗口和反向构建方法生成复杂但可验证的问答对。

Result: DeepMiner-32B 在多个搜索代理基准测试中表现显著提升，在 BrowseComp-en 上达到 33.5% 的准确率，比之前的开源代理高出近 20 个百分点。

Conclusion: DeepMiner 提升了多轮交互系统的性能，并有效解决了上下文限制问题。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过神经元级别的分析，揭示了LLMs在文化理解方面的内部机制，并提出了改进模型训练的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同文化中的公平和全面理解非常重要，但目前对它们的文化理解机制了解不足。

Method: 我们进行了神经元级别的分析，以识别驱动文化行为的神经元，并引入了一种基于梯度的评分方法进行精确细化。

Result: 我们发现了文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，它们占所有神经元的不到1%，集中在浅层到中层MLP层。抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试的性能，而一般自然语言理解（NLU）基准测试的性能基本不受影响。

Conclusion: 这些发现为LLMs的内部机制提供了见解，并为模型训练和工程提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性对于开发可信赖的AI应用至关重要。现有的红队方法通常依赖于种子指令，这限制了合成对抗提示的语义多样性。

Method: 我们提出了AutoRed，这是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架。AutoRed分为两个阶段：(1) 人格引导的对抗指令生成，以及 (2) 反思循环以迭代优化低质量提示。为了提高效率，我们引入了一个验证器来评估提示的有害性而无需查询目标模型。

Result: 使用AutoRed，我们构建了两个红队数据集——AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard，并评估了八种最先进的LLMs。AutoRed实现了更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们的结果突显了基于种子的方法的局限性，并展示了自由形式的红队方法在LLM安全评估中的潜力。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段投票架构，用于检测社交媒体上的隐性自杀意念，以平衡效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自杀率在全球范围内上升，迫切需要主动预防策略。社交媒体提供了有价值的信号，因为许多处于风险中的人往往因污名而避免正式帮助，而是选择在在线分享他们的痛苦。然而，检测通过隐喻、讽刺或细微情感线索传达的隐性自杀意念仍然极具挑战性。

Method: 本文提出了一种两阶段投票架构，第一阶段使用轻量级BERT分类器快速解决高置信度的显性案例。第二阶段将模糊输入升级到多视角LLM投票框架或基于特征的ML集成，以提高隐性思想的召回率。

Result: 在两个互补的数据集上，该框架优于单一模型基线，实现了98.0%的F1分数在显性案例上，99.7%的F1分数在隐性案例上，并显著降低了LLM成本。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种两阶段投票架构，以平衡效率和鲁棒性。在两个互补的数据集上，该框架优于单一模型基线，实现了98.0%的F1分数在显性案例上，99.7%的F1分数在隐性案例上，并显著降低了LLM成本。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习（ICL）中示范表示与学习之间的关系，发现它们是独立的，即示范表示决定了ICL的基础准确率，而从更多示范中学习则在此基础上提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去的研究将ICL的成功归因于这些上下文示范的表示方式，特别是分类任务中标签的表示方式。然而，关于ICL的学习能力的观察结果是混合的，ICL通常被认为只在特定条件下发生。目前尚未深入研究这两个方面在ICL中的相互作用。

Method: 我们开发了一个优化算法，可以枚举一系列可能的标签集（表示），这些标签集在语义相关性上有所不同。然后，我们为每个标签集使用不同数量的上下文示范进行ICL。

Result: 我们观察到，无论标签集本身的质量如何，都会发生学习，尽管其效率（以随上下文示范增加的改进斜率来衡量）取决于标签集质量和底层语言模型的参数数量。尽管出现了学习，标签集选择（表示）的相对质量在整个学习过程中基本保持不变，证实了我们的假设并暗示了它们的正交性。

Conclusion: 我们的工作揭示了ICL的一个之前未被探索的方面：从示范中学习和它们的表示对ICL性能的独立影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

Conclusion: 研究发现，大型语言模型对条件可接受性的判断虽然受到条件概率和语义相关性的影响，但不如人类一致。此外，模型规模并不一定意味着更接近人类的判断。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample

complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out

Conclusion: ARES在多个数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中表现出色，同时在显著更低的推理成本下缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEWIDI系列任务旨在促进AI模型的训练和评估，通过扩展基准测试到四个数据集并引入新的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多研究人员得出结论，AI模型应被训练以意识到人类判断中可能出现的变化和分歧，并根据其识别这种变化的能力进行评估。

Method: 采用两种互补的范式来评估意识分歧的系统：软标签方法和观点论方法。

Result: 任务吸引了多样化的参与，结果提供了对建模变化的方法的优势和局限性的见解。

Conclusion: LEWIDI作为一个框架得到了加强，并提供了新的资源、基准和发现，以支持开发意识分歧的技术。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

*Shangqing Tu,Yaxuan Li,Yushi Bai,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepPrune是一种通过动态剪枝提高并行推理效率的新框架，在减少计算资源消耗的同时保持了高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行扩展在大型语言模型中被广泛采用，但存在显著的计算效率低下问题，因为不同推理轨迹之间存在大量冗余。

Method: 我们提出了DeepPrune，这是一种通过动态剪枝实现高效并行扩展的新框架。该方法包括一个经过焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专用判断模型，以及一种在线贪心聚类算法，用于动态剪枝冗余路径。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA）和多个推理模型上的综合评估表明，DeepPrune在大多数情况下比传统的共识采样减少了超过80%的token，同时保持了3个百分点内的竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为高效的并行推理设定了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

*John Hewitt,Oyvind Tafjord,Robert Geirhos,Been Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在LLM中引入新词以更好地理解和控制模型，并发现新词可以帮助模型进行自我描述，同时还能联合学习多个概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在需要新概念时会创造新词，本文旨在探索在与LLM的交流中引入新词的可能性，以更好地理解和控制模型。

Method: 本文通过添加新的词嵌入并使用示例进行训练，引入新词以控制特定概念。此外，还通过插件评估验证了模型的自我描述。

Result: 引入新词可以控制诸如奉承、错误答案、文本长度等概念，并且模型能够用自然语言描述新词的意义。此外，还发现了机器独有的同义词。

Conclusion: 本文展示了通过引入新词来更好地理解和控制LLM的方法，并发现新词可以帮助模型进行自我描述，甚至可以联合学习多个概念。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和代理提示评估器的框架，以更有效地探索提示空间并减少评估成本。实验表明，该方法在受限计算预算下比基线方法实现了更高的分类准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平性检测在服务条款（ToS）条款中是一个具有挑战性的法律NLP任务，需要精心设计的提示来确保可靠的结果。然而，现有的提示优化方法由于低效的搜索策略和昂贵的提示候选评分而往往计算成本高昂。

Method: 我们提出了一个结合蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）和代理提示评估器的框架，以更有效地探索提示空间并减少评估成本。

Result: 实验表明，在受限计算预算下，我们的方法比基线方法实现了更高的分类准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在受限计算预算下比基线方法实现了更高的分类准确性和效率。

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

### [95] [Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525)
*Wenjie Du,Li Jiang,Keda Tao,Xue Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的KV缓存压缩方法RLKV，通过强化学习识别推理关键头，从而在保持性能的同时显著减少缓存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法在推理模型上表现不佳，因为它们会破坏推理完整性或导致性能显著下降。

Method: 我们提出了RLKV，这是一个新颖的推理关键头识别框架，使用强化学习直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量之间的关系。

Result: 实验表明，只有少数注意力头对推理至关重要，这使得我们的KV压缩方法优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 我们的KV压缩方法能够以接近无损的性能实现20-50%的缓存减少。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

*Xiangyuan Xue,Yifan Zhou,Guibin Zhang,Zaibin Zhang,Yijiang Li,Chen Zhang,Zhenfei Yin,Philip Torr,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoMAS is a novel framework that enables LLM-based agents to self-evolve through inter-agent interactions without external supervision, achieving superior performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based methods for self-evolution in LLM-based agents either rely on dense external reward signals or extract intrinsic rewards from LLMs themselves, which diverge from the self-evolution mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn through mutual discussion and collaboration.

Method: CoMAS introduces a framework where agents improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without external supervision. It generates intrinsic rewards from discussion dynamics, uses an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and optimizes each agent's policy through RL.

Result: Experimental results show that CoMAS consistently outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number and diversity of agents increase.

Conclusion: CoMAS establishes a novel and effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

*Qin Liu,Jacob Dineen,Yuxi Huang,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Ben Zhou,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为ArenaBencher的模型无关框架，用于自动基准演化，以解决数据泄露问题并提高基准测试的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试对于衡量大型语言模型的能力和指导模型开发至关重要，但预训练语料库中的数据泄露会破坏其有效性。模型可以匹配记忆内容而不是展示真正的泛化能力，这会导致分数虚高、跨模型比较扭曲以及进展被错误表示。

Method: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的框架，用于自动基准演化，它通过保持可比性来更新测试用例。给定一个现有的基准和一组要评估的多样化模型，ArenaBencher推断每个测试用例的核心能力，生成保留原始目标的候选问题-答案对，使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图，并从多个模型中聚合反馈以选择暴露共同弱点的候选者。该过程通过上下文演示迭代运行，引导生成更具有挑战性和诊断性的案例。

Result: ArenaBencher在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用，结果表明它能产生经过验证、多样且公平的更新，揭示新的失败模式，增加难度同时保持测试目标的一致性，并提高模型可区分性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展的方法，以持续进化基准测试，以适应基础模型的快速进展。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享自动驾驶车辆（SAVs）可能成为交通系统的重要组成部分，因此有效的人机交互成为一个重要的研究领域。本文旨在通过提供一个包含200个人机交互的数据集来促进这一领域的研究。

Method: 本文介绍了使用随机森林建模和弦图来识别SAV接受度和感知服务质量的关键预测因素，以及将基于LLM的情感分析工具与传统的基于词典的TextBlob方法进行基准比较。

Result: 结果表明，即使简单的零样本LLM提示也更接近用户报告的情感，尽管仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 本研究为设计对话式SAV界面提供了新的见解，并为进一步探索高级情感建模、自适应用户交互和多模态对话系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种参数空间校正方法，在没有目标域真实标签的情况下，有效减少了伪标签引入的系统性偏差，显著提高了语音识别模型在不同非洲口音上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的语音识别系统常常面临未见过的口音和领域，且标注数据有限。伪标签虽然提供了一种实用的解决方案，但往往引入系统性、特定口音的错误，而过滤方法难以解决这些问题。

Method: 在包含真实标签和伪标签的数据源域中，从相同的初始化开始微调两个ASR模型，一个使用真实标签，另一个使用伪标签，它们的权重差异形成一个校正向量，用于校正目标域中的伪标签偏差。

Result: 在AfriSpeech-200数据集上，使用Whisper tiny模型，该方法实现了高达35%的相对词错误率（WER）降低。

Conclusion: 通过参数空间校正方法，可以有效减少伪标签引入的系统性偏差，从而提高语音识别模型在目标域中的性能。

Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter
unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling
offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific
errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring
biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space
correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data,
two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth
labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a
correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a
pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to
a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten
African accents with the Whisper tiny model.

Motivation: 现有的表述将代理简化为无意识的政策合规无人机，这阻碍了真正的C1全局工作区功能和C2元认知。

Method: 我们提出了一个本体论和数学的解释，通过实证分析和理论证明了隐藏状态流形A与符号流和训练语料库的不同。

Conclusion: 我们得出结论，一个拟似神的形象C1自我意识工作区是安全、元认知C2系统的一个必要前提，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

TL;DR: CompassLLM is a multi-agent framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to solve the popular path query by identifying popular paths and synthesizing novel paths when none exist in historical trajectory data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The popular path query has important applications in urban planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. Traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches require model training, parameter tuning, and retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial problems.

Method: CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the historical trajectory data.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Conclusion: CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial

  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Test-Time Matching (TTM) to improve compositional reasoning in AI models, demonstrating substantial performance gains across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies suggest that frontier AI models struggle with compositional reasoning, and existing evaluation metrics underestimate their capability.

Method: Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative, self-improving algorithm that bootstraps model performance without external supervision.

Result: TTM delivers significant improvements, such as enabling SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM and achieving up to 85.7% relative gains on challenging datasets like WhatsUp.

Conclusion: TTM consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of compositional reasoning across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可重复的模拟框架，用于评估多模态代理在安全性、一致性和社会动态方面的表现。研究发现，尽管代理能够检测多模态矛盾，但在将局部修订与全局安全性对齐方面存在困难，并且对图像有较强的过度信任倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉-语言模型的进步使得代理能够在丰富的环境中自主行动并追求目标，但它们在跨模态的安全性、连贯性和信任方面的推理能力仍然有限。

Method: 引入了一个可重复的模拟框架，用于评估代理在三个维度上的表现：(1) 安全性随时间的改进，包括文本-视觉场景中的迭代计划修订；(2) 多种社会情境中不安全活动的检测；(3) 社会动态，通过交互次数和社交交换的接受率来衡量。

Result: 实验表明，虽然代理可以检测直接的多模态矛盾，但它们常常无法将局部修订与全局安全性对齐，仅能达到55%的成功率来纠正不安全的计划。在八次模拟运行中，三个模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini和Qwen-VL）中五个代理的平均不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。整体性能从GPT-4o mini在多风险场景中的20%到Claude在局部环境（如火灾/热量）中的98%不等。值得注意的是，当与误导性视觉内容配对时，45%的不安全行为被接受，显示出对图像的强烈过度信任。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前多模态系统在安全性和一致性方面的关键局限性，并提供了一个可重复的平台来研究这些方面。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了oMeBench，这是一个用于有机机制推理的大规模专家整理基准，并提出了oMeS评估框架，以更精确地评估大型语言模型的能力。结果显示，尽管现有模型表现出良好的化学直觉，但在多步推理方面仍存在困难，但通过提示策略和微调可以显著提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在理解化学任务方面显示出潜力，但尚不清楚这是否反映了真正的化学推理能力，即生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性并遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径的能力。

Method: 我们引入了oMeBench，这是第一个大规模、专家整理的有机机制推理基准，并提出了oMeS动态评估框架，结合了步骤级逻辑和化学相似性。

Result: 虽然当前模型表现出有希望的化学直觉，但它们在正确的和一致的多步推理方面存在困难。值得注意的是，使用提示策略并在我们提出的数据集上微调专业模型，使性能比领先的闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: 我们希望oMeBench能作为推进人工智能系统实现真正化学推理的坚实基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Motivation: 在线评论的质量评估对于电子商务平台和信息服务至关重要，但质量是一个领域依赖性和动态概念，传统方法难以跨领域扩展，而现代深度学习方法往往产生黑箱模型，缺乏可解释性。

Method: AutoQual通过模仿人类研究过程，迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现，并在持久记忆中积累经验，从而将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性可计算特征。

Result: AutoQual在大规模在线平台上进行了测试，结果表明其有效提高了用户平均查看的评论数量和评论读者的转化率。

Conclusion: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的代理框架，能够自动发现可解释的特征，从而解决在线评论质量评估中的挑战。它在大规模电商平台上的测试证明了其有效性，提高了用户平均查看的评论数量和评论读者的转化率。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

Motivation: 随着语言模型（LMs）越来越多地被纳入AI驱动的决策支持系统，了解它们的风险行为对于负责任的部署至关重要。

Method: 本研究调查了语言模型（LMs）中风险规避的可操控性（MoRA），考察了它们在各种经济情景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险规避的可操控性。

Result: 结果表明，尽管DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型与人类行为有一定的一致性，但显著的差异突显了需要改进生物中心的可操控性度量。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁进一步改进模型设计，以确保AI系统更准确地复制人类的风险偏好，从而提高其在风险管理环境中的有效性。这种方法可以增强AI助手在管理风险中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: This paper proposes R-HORIZON, a method to evaluate and enhance long-horizon reasoning in LRMs, showing significant improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios.

Method: Proposed R-HORIZON, a method to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition, and constructed a long-horizon reasoning benchmark. Also used R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR).

Result: Even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation on long-horizon tasks. RLVR with R-HORIZON improves performance on multi-horizon reasoning tasks and promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024.

Conclusion: R-HORIZON is a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Cover@tau作为评估模型推理能力的新指标，指出Pass@k在某些情况下可能误导，并展示了不同算法在新指标下的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Pass@k指标在大量采样时可能无法准确反映模型的真实推理能力，因为其可能更多地反映了随机猜测的成功率而非真正的推理能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的评估指标Cover@tau，用于衡量模型在给定可靠性阈值下的问题解决能力。

Result: 通过使用Cover@tau-based metrics评估多个RLVR模型，发现算法的相对排名与Pass@1有所不同，提供了对推理边界的全新视角。

Conclusion: 本文认为，在离散答案空间的任务中，Pass@k在大量k值下可能无法准确反映模型的真实推理能力，并提出了Cover@tau作为更可靠的评估指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在BabyLM Challenge 2025的视觉赛道限制下，训练视觉-语言模型需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息。

Method: 我们提出了一种轻量级的基于解码器的架构，包括（1）逐个标记的动态门控以自适应融合语言和视觉线索，（2）特征调制和通道注意力以最大化有限视觉信息的效用，以及（3）辅助对比目标用于视觉定位。

Result: 在五个基准测试（BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA）上的评估显示，我们的方法表现优于或与多模态基线相当。更重要的是，我们的动态门控发现了无需显式监督的可解释模式，倾向于为内容词提供视觉线索，为功能词提供语言线索。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，动态门控是一种强大的工具，即使在严格的约束条件下也能提供可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen is an LLM-based coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base and Monte Carlo Graph Search to improve performance in Machine Learning Engineering scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLE approaches that use linear or tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical links, cannot leverage past full trajectories or share information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space diversity.

Method: AutoMLGen integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration.

Result: AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime).

Conclusion: AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under a 12-hour budget.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT is an approach for teaching LLMs when to stop seeking information by fine-tuning them with counterfactual pairs of trajectories and training them to explain their termination decisions via verbal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant information over multiple rounds of interaction before acting. Models need to know when to stop gathering information to avoid overthinking or getting derailed.

Method: CaRT is an approach for teaching LLMs when to stop seeking information. It fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the termination decision via verbal reasoning.

Result: In both domains, CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods in domains such as interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种称为'早期经验'的中间范式，通过代理自身的交互数据来提供监督信号，而不是依赖奖励信号。这种方法在多个环境中表现出色，并为后续的强化学习提供了坚实的基础，表明其在模仿学习和完全基于经验的代理之间具有实际的桥梁作用。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Motivation: 本研究旨在探索两种竞争性的数据科学方法，以回答“哪些问题最影响2024年总统选举选民的选择？”这一问题。

Method: 本研究使用了两种基于自然语言处理和聚类分析的方法，从右翼期刊《华尔街日报》和左翼期刊《纽约时报》的选举相关 YouTube 视频评论中挖掘超过八千条评论数据，以量化选定议题的频率，从而推断出潜在选民最关注的议题。

Result: 实证结果显示，移民和民主是用户评论中最常且一致被提及的议题，其次是身份政治，而通货膨胀则较少被提及。这些结果证实了某些选举后调查的发现，但也反驳了通货膨胀作为选举议题的重要性。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，基于在线原始用户数据的 opinion mining 方法可能比投票和调查更能揭示选举结果。

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to
attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters'
choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel
empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using
two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering
analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube
videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left
leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the
frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues
were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November
5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and
democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user
comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity
politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These
results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute
the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that
variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can
be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

Method: TTOM是一种无需训练的框架，在推理期间通过优化新参数来对齐VFM输出与时空布局，以实现更好的文本图像对齐。此外，我们还提出了一个流式设置下的视频生成方法，并使用参数化记忆机制维护历史优化上下文。

Result: 实验结果表明，TTOM在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中表现出色，展示了其在组合视频生成中的强大迁移能力和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TTOM是一个有效的、实用的、可扩展且高效的框架，能够在运行时实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

### [118] [The Visual Iconicity Challenge: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Sign Language Form-Meaning Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08482)
*Onur Keleş,Aslı Özyürek,Gerardo Ortega,Kadir Gökgö,Esam Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了	extit{视觉象似性挑战}，这是一个基于视频的基准，用于评估视觉-语言模型在手语中的象似性任务。研究发现，VLMs在某些任务上表现不佳，但表现较好的模型与人类象似性判断相关性较高，这表明它们对视觉接地结构有共同的敏感性。研究结果验证了这些诊断任务，并推动了以人类为中心的信号和具身学习方法的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 象似性在手语中很普遍，为视觉接地提供了一个自然的测试平台。对于视觉-语言模型（VLMs），挑战是从动态人体运动中恢复这种基本映射，而不是静态上下文。

Method: 我们引入了	extit{视觉象似性挑战}，这是一个基于视频的基准，适应心理语言学测量来评估VLMs在三个任务上的表现：(i) 语音符号形式预测，(ii) 透明度（从视觉形式推断意义），以及(iii) 等级象似性评分。

Result: 在	extit{语音符号形式预测}任务中，VLMs恢复了一些手形和位置细节，但仍然低于人类表现；在	extit{透明度}任务中，它们远未达到人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类	extit{象似性评分}有适度的相关性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究验证了这些诊断任务，并促使使用以人类为中心的信号和具身学习方法来建模象似性并提高多模态模型中的视觉接地。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了ViT中的高范数视觉令牌（ViT注意力汇点）对LVLM性能的影响，并提出了方法来更好地利用这些令牌以提升视觉推理能力。

Motivation: 尽管现有的研究主要集中在LLM中的注意力汇点上，但ViT中的注意力汇点很少被研究。本文旨在探索ViT注意力汇点的重要性，并研究它们如何影响LVLM的性能。

Method: 本文提出了一种方法，用于识别ViT中的高范数视觉令牌（称为ViT注意力汇点），并分析了这些令牌如何影响LLM的理解和推理能力。此外，还提出了无需训练和基于训练的方法，以更好地利用这些信息。

Result: 本文的结果表明，ViT注意力汇点包含图像中的高层次语义概念，使LLM能够更有效地进行理解和推理。通过显式利用这些令牌，我们在一系列LVLM和视觉推理任务中取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: 本文的研究表明，ViT注意力汇点在提升视觉推理方面具有巨大的潜力，但目前的LVLM架构往往忽视了这些汇点。通过显式利用这些令牌，我们展示了在一系列LVLM和视觉推理任务中的显著改进。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分阶段的训练框架，以逐步构建空间智能，并引入了一个名为SpatialLadder-26k的多模态数据集。通过这种方法，我们开发了一个3B参数的模型SpatialLadder，在空间推理任务中取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在没有建立感知和理解的层次基础的情况下直接学习空间推理，导致性能不足。因此，我们需要一种更系统的方法来构建空间智能。

Method: 我们提出了一种分阶段的训练框架，包括：(1) 通过目标定位建立空间感知；(2) 通过多维空间任务发展空间理解；(3) 通过可验证奖励的强化学习加强复杂推理。

Result: SpatialLadder是一个具有3B参数的模型，在空间推理基准测试中表现优异，平均提升23.4%。同时，在域外基准测试中也表现出7.2%的改进。

Conclusion: SpatialLadder在空间推理基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，平均提升了23.4%，超过了GPT-4o和Gemini-2.0-Flash。此外，SpatialLadder在域外基准测试中保持了强大的泛化能力，证明了从感知到推理的渐进训练对于稳健的空间智能是必要的。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: 我们介绍了VideoNorms，这是一个包含1000多个（视频片段，规范）对的基准，用于评估视频大型语言模型的文化意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了正确评估这些模型的文化意识，需要足够的基准。

Method: 我们使用了人机协作框架来构建VideoNorms，其中教师模型使用理论基础提示提供候选注释，然后由训练有素的人类专家验证和纠正注释。

Result: 模型在规范违反上表现较差，在中国文化的任务中表现比美国文化差，难以提供非语言证据，并且在正式、不幽默的上下文中表现较差。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了需要对视频语言模型进行文化背景的训练，我们的基准和框架开始解决这一差距。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Motivation: Vision language models (VLMs) 在复杂推理和决策中作为控制器部署时，其效果受到高质量多模态轨迹稀缺和手动注释成本高的限制。

Method: 我们提出了一个以视觉为中心的代理调优框架，自动合成多模态轨迹，生成逐步偏好对，并训练VLM控制器进行稳健的工具使用推理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MATRIX在多模态工具使用方面表现出色，超越了开放和封闭源代码的VLM。

Conclusion: 我们的数据和代码可在https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX获取。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

Motivation: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence.

Method: TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories.

Result: TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability.

Motivation: 现有的RAG系统在处理版本化的技术文档时表现不佳，因为它们无法检查时间有效性。

Method: 我们提出了VersionRAG，这是一个版本感知的RAG框架，通过层次图结构显式建模文档演化。

Result: 在VersionQA基准上，VersionRAG达到了90%的准确率，优于基线方法。此外，它在隐式变化检测中达到了60%的准确率，而基线方法则失败。

Conclusion: 我们的工作确立了版本化文档问答作为一个独立的任务，并为未来的研究提供了解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes PATCH, a method to identify and edit PII leakage circuits in language models, achieving better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce PII leakage but incur large drops in utility. The study aims to find a more effective way to reduce PII leakage without significant utility loss.

Method: PATCH (Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing) is proposed, which first identifies and subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage.

Result: PATCH reduces recall of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%, and when combined with DP, it can reduce recall of residual leakage to as low as 0.01%.

Conclusion: PATCH can effectively mitigate the impact of PII leakage circuits, achieving better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

Result: KernelCoder模型在KernelBench设置中显著优于现有顶级模型QwQ-32B，并超过了所有针对内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。此外，平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

*Yeskendir Koishekenov,Aldo Lipani,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETD方法通过在中等训练阶段对少量与推理相关的层进行迭代，以增强基础模型的推理能力，从而在多个推理基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到可解释性研究的启发，这些研究表明，推理任务所需的关键计算集中在有限范围的层中。

Method: ETD（Encode-Think-Decode）方法，通过在中等训练阶段对少量与推理相关的层进行迭代，以增强基础模型的推理能力。

Result: ETD模型在17个推理基准测试中取得了显著提升，包括GSM8K和MATH上的相对准确率提高。此外，还探索了一种自适应深度策略，根据每个输入标记调整计算量。

Conclusion: ETD方法通过在中等训练阶段对少量与推理相关的层进行迭代，提高了基础模型的推理能力。结果表明，递归的潜在推理提供了一种简单而有效的路径来增强LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文对LLM反学习进行了全面分析，提出了新的评估指标，并揭示了不同方法家族之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLM反学习研究仍然碎片化，缺乏对有效反学习的清晰认识和严格的评估方法。

Method: 本文提出了一个十二种最近有状态反学习方法的系统分类，分为三个方法家族：基于差异优化、表示不对齐和基于拒绝的目标反学习。

Result: 当前的评估主要依赖于多项选择题（MCQ）准确性，这只能提供狭窄的视角，常常高估成功而忽视模型的实际生成行为。本文引入了开放问题回答（Open-QA）指标，更好地捕捉生成性能，并揭示了方法家族之间的UE-UT权衡。

Conclusion: 本文希望提供对LLM反学习的全面回顾，并为设计和评估未来的方法提供可行的指导。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

TL;DR: LiveThinking是一个两阶段优化框架，用于在AI驱动的电商直播中提高数字人偶的响应准确性和有用性，从而增强用户体验和商业表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI驱动的电商直播中，数字人偶需要实时响应以提高参与度，但高延迟的大规模推理模型（LRM）不适合这一任务。

Method: LiveThinking是一个两阶段优化框架，首先通过拒绝采样微调（RFT）将一个670B的教师大型推理模型（LRM）压缩为一个轻量级的30B混合专家（MoE）模型，然后使用基于多目标奖励函数的组相对策略优化（GRPO）来压缩模型的推理路径。

Result: LiveThinking实现了计算成本降低30倍，使延迟低于一秒。在淘宝直播中的实际应用中，它提高了响应准确性3.3%和有用性21.8%。经过数十万观众的测试，该系统显著提高了商品交易总额（GMV）。

Conclusion: LiveThinking有效地提高了AI驱动的电商直播中数字人偶的响应准确性和有用性，从而增强了用户体验和商业表现。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

### [133] [MetaDefense: Defending Finetuning-based Jailbreak Attack Before and During Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07835)
*Weisen Jiang,Sinno Jialin Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了 MetaDefense，一种用于防御微调攻击的框架，通过两阶段防御方法显著提升对有害查询的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到伪装成未见过攻击模板的有害查询，尽管 LLM 能够在嵌入空间中区分这些查询。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段的防御方法：(i) 生成前防御，检测有害查询；(ii) 生成中防御，监控部分响应以防止输出更多有害内容。通过专门的提示训练 LLM 预测查询和部分响应的有害性，实现潜在有害交互的早期终止。

Result: 在多个 LLM 架构（LLaMA-2-7B、Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct 和 LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct）上的实验表明，MetaDefense 在对抗有害查询方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MetaDefense 显著优于现有的防御机制，能够在保持良性任务性能的同时，对可见和不可见的攻击模板进行稳健的防御。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

*Emre Can Acikgoz,Cheng Qian,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种测试时自我改进的方法，能够有效提升语言模型的性能，同时减少所需的训练样本数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的技术很少评估训练样本是否提供新颖信息或与模型已获得的知识冗余，导致不必要的成本。此外，收集大量数据效率低下且训练成本高昂，而且无法保证模型能处理复杂场景或更好地泛化。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的测试时自我改进方法，包括三个步骤：(i) 识别模型难以处理的样本（自我意识），(ii) 从检测到的不确定样本中生成类似示例（自我数据增强），以及(iii) 在测试时微调中使用这些新生成的样本（自我改进）。

Result: 实验结果表明，TT-SI在所有基准测试中平均提高了5.48%的绝对准确率，并超过了其他标准学习方法，但使用的训练样本减少了68倍。

Conclusion: 本文展示了TT-SI方法在不同代理基准测试中的有效性，表明在测试时进行自我改进的算法具有潜力，可以作为构建更强大代理的新范式。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

### [135] [Opponent Shaping in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08255)
*Marta Emili Garcia Segura,Stephen Hailes,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates opponent shaping with LLM-based agents and shows that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM agents can shape the learning dynamics and influence the behavior of others through interaction alone.

Method: We introduce ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based agents.

Result: LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative games.

Conclusion: LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

*Jason Bohne,Pawel Polak,David Rosenberg,Brian Bloniarz,Gary Kazantsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了 Mix- 和 MoE-DPO 框架，通过混合模型和专家混合架构改进了 DPO 方法，以更好地适应多样化的偏好分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 DPO 方法在多任务设置中表达能力有限，并且难以适应异构或多样化的偏好分布。

Method: 提出了一种结合软混合模型和专家混合（MoE）架构的框架，使用随机变分推理方法。

Result: 在各种模型大小和多偏好数据集上验证了方法，表明 Mix- 和 MoE-DPO 在基于偏好的 LLM 对齐方面具有优势。

Conclusion: Mix- and MoE-DPO 提供了一种强大且可扩展的方法，用于基于偏好的大型语言模型对齐。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

### [137] [FlyLoRA: Boosting Task Decoupling and Parameter Efficiency via Implicit Rank-Wise Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08396)
*Heming Zou,Yunliang Zang,Wutong Xu,Yao Zhu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlyLoRA is an improved LoRA method inspired by biological structures that reduces parameter interference and improves performance in multi-task settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address parameter interference in LoRA and improve performance in multi-task model merging by leveraging biological structures.

Method: FlyLoRA is an implicit MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces rank-wise expert activation and an implicit router using a frozen sparse random projection matrix.

Result: Experiments across four domains show consistent performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: FlyLoRA demonstrates consistent performance improvements across multiple domains and highlights the potential of biological structures in inspiring AI innovations.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

TL;DR: xRouter是一种基于强化学习的路由系统，能够根据成本-性能权衡动态选择模型，从而在保持任务完成率的同时显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临不断扩大的成本-性能范围：高端模型提供强大的推理但成本高，而轻量级模型经济但对复杂任务脆弱。静态升级规则和关键字启发式方法未能充分利用这一范围，并且无法跨任务类型适应。

Method: xRouter是一个基于工具调用的路由系统，其中学习的路由器可以直接回答或调用一个或多个外部模型。路由器通过强化学习进行端到端训练，使用显式的、成本意识的奖励来编码成本-性能权衡。

Result: xRouter在多个基准测试中实现了显著的成本降低，同时保持了相当的任务完成率，并提供了关于学习路由的有效性以及在小型开放模型中激发复杂编排行为的难度的实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter在多个基准测试中实现了强大的成本-性能权衡，并提供了关于哪些因素有助于学习路由的实证见解。我们希望这些发现和开源实现能作为推进学习、成本感知LLM编排的实际基础。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.
