Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items.

These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24).

Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions.

A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27).

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark.

This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis.

Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the use of generative AI models to create multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Portuguese for reading comprehension tasks.", "motivation": "The manual creation of MCQs is time-consuming and costly.

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study introduces methods to identify and analyze regret expressions in large language models, proposing new metrics and workflows to overcome existing challenges.", "motivation": "To enhance model reliability and understand how cognition is coded in neural networks by studying the regret mechanism in large language models.", "method": "Proposes a workflow for constructing a regret dataset, S-CDI metric for identifying optimal regret representation layers, and RDS metric for identifying regret neurons along with GIC for analyzing activation patterns.", "result": "Successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer, revealed an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, and categorized neurons into three functional groups.", "conclusion": "The study provides new insights into the regret mechanism in large language models, offering tools to improve model reliability and understanding of cognitive coding in neural networks."}}

Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost.

This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology.

Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change.

Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u9002\u914d\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u6a21\u677f\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e46.62%\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u7f13\u5b58\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4ece\u5df2\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8ba1\u5212\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u63d0\u53d6\u5339\u914d\u65b0\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0e\u7f13\u5b58\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u677f\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1146.62%\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8ba1\u5212\u7f13\u5b58\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u670d\u52a1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

While $\u03bc$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\u03bc$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity.

This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input.

Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces PRISM, a new method for describing neural network features that can handle polysemantic features, which outperforms previous methods by providing more accurate and faithful descriptions.", "motivation": "Current feature description methods have limited robustness and assume that each neuron encodes only a single concept, despite evidence showing that neurons are often polysemantic.", "method": "The authors developed PRISM, a novel framework that captures the complexity of neural network features and provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features.", "result": "PRISM was applied to language models and benchmarked against existing methods, demonstrating improved accuracy and faithfulness in feature descriptions.", "conclusion": "PRISM offers a more effective way to describe neural network features, especially those with multiple meanings, enhancing the interpretability of model behavior."}}

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can generate dense latents which are meaningful model representations rather than training artifacts.", "motivation": "To investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents in SAEs.", "method": "Systematic investigation including demonstrating the properties of dense latents, introducing a taxonomy of dense latents, and analyzing their evolution across layers.", "result": "Dense latents form antipodal pairs, reflect meaningful model representations, and can be categorized into several classes like position tracking and entropy regulation.
