This paper\ninvestigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases\nwhere they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain\nwhere the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the\nability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that\npresuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to\nengage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to\ntheir level of knowledge and their political bias.

However, prior work\nhas predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks\nand single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to\ncompositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This\nwork introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile\nagents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,\nContext Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in\n20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online\nChinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates\nwith an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a\nrange of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that\nUI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents\ngenerally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting\nrepresentative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and\nattention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.\nInspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient\nscheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nextrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing\nlong-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks.

In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to\nverify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the\nactual cost constraint.
