### [1] [Evaluating Long-Term Memory for Long-Context Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23730)
*Alessandra Terranova,Björn Ross,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了记忆增强方法在长上下文对话任务中的效果，发现记忆增强方法可以显著减少令牌使用量，同时保持竞争力准确性。记忆架构的复杂性应与模型能力成比例，不同模型类型从不同的记忆方法中获益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使大型语言模型实现真正的对话连续性和从经验学习中受益，它们需要记忆。尽管研究集中在开发复杂的记忆系统上，但尚不清楚哪种类型的记忆对于长上下文对话任务最有效。

Method: 我们使用LoCoMo基准对记忆增强方法进行了系统评估，该基准是用于需要多样化推理策略的问题回答任务的合成长上下文对话。我们分析了全上下文提示、通过检索增强生成的语义记忆和代理记忆，以及通过上下文学习的事件记忆和通过提示优化的程序记忆。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，记忆增强方法在保持竞争力准确性的同时，可以将令牌使用量减少90%以上。记忆架构的复杂性应与模型能力成比例，小型基础模型最受益于RAG，而强大的指令调优推理模型则从通过反思的回忆学习和更复杂的代理语义记忆中获益。特别是，回忆记忆可以帮助LLM认识到自己知识的局限性。

Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity
and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has
focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which
types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We
present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a
benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering
tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context
prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic
memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory
through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches
reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory
architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small
foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned
reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more
complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs
recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

### [2] [BitSkip: An Empirical Analysis of Quantization and Early Exit Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23766)
*Ramshankar Bhuvaneswaran,Handan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出BitSkip框架，发现8位量化模型在性能上优于更复杂的模型，但Hadamard变换会显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有许多关于高效大语言模型的技术，但这些技术的组合效果仍不明确，因此需要一种系统的方法来研究它们的交互作用。

Method: 本文提出了BitSkip框架，用于系统地探索不同技术的组合效果，并通过实验验证了不同配置的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，BitSkip-V1在8位量化下优于更复杂的4位和Hadamard增强模型，并且在质量上可以与全精度基线相媲美。然而，引入Hadamard变换导致性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: BitSkip-V1展示了一种在保持高质量的同时提高效率的可行方法，而引入Hadamard变换会导致性能显著下降。

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing. While
individual benefits of these methods are well-documented, their compositional
effects remain poorly understood. This paper introduces BitSkip, a hybrid
architectural framework for systematically exploring these interactions.
Counter-intuitively, our findings reveal that a simple 8-bit quantized model
without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1) not only outperforms its more complex
4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts but also competes the full-precision
baseline in quality (perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19) . The introduction of Hadamard
transforms, even at 8-bit precision, catastrophically degraded performance by
over 37,000%, tracing fundamental training instability. Our BitSkip-V1 recipe
demonstrates superior early-exit characteristics, with layer 18 providing
optimal 32.5% speed gain for minimal 4% quality loss.

### [3] [Beyond Understanding: Evaluating the Pragmatic Gap in LLMs' Cultural Processing of Figurative Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23828)
*Mena Attia,Aashiq Muhamed,Mai Alkhamissi,Thamar Solorio,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型处理文化根基语言（如比喻表达）的能力，发现它们在理解方面表现尚可，但在实际使用和含义解释方面存在挑战。研究还发布了Kinayat数据集以支持未来的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们旨在全面评估大型语言模型处理文化根基语言的能力，特别是理解并实际使用编码本地知识和文化细微差别的比喻表达的能力。

Method: 我们使用比喻语言作为文化细微差别和本地知识的代理，设计了评估任务，包括上下文理解、实际使用和含义解释。我们评估了22个开源和闭源大型语言模型在埃及阿拉伯语成语、多方言阿拉伯语谚语和英语谚语上的表现。

Result: 结果表明存在一个一致的层次结构：阿拉伯语谚语的平均准确率比英语谚语低4.29%，埃及成语的性能比阿拉伯语谚语低10.28%。在实际使用任务中，准确率比理解任务下降了14.07%，但提供上下文成语句子可提高准确率10.66%。模型在含义解释方面也表现出困难，最多只能达到85.58%的人类标注者一致性。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，比喻语言是文化推理的有效诊断工具：虽然大型语言模型通常可以解释比喻意义，但在适当使用它方面面临挑战。为了支持未来的研究，我们发布了Kinayat数据集，这是第一个针对埃及阿拉伯语成语的图式理解和实际使用评估的数据集。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to process culturally grounded language, specifically to understand and
pragmatically use figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and
cultural nuance. Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and
local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding,
pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We
evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms,
multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a
consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower
than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower
than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07%
relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences
improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning,
reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100%
inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language
serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often
interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.
To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian
Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use
evaluation.

### [4] [How Pragmatics Shape Articulation: A Computational Case Study in STEM ASL Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23842)
*Saki Imai,Lee Kezar,Laurel Aichler,Mert Inan,Erin Walker,Alicia Wooten,Lorna Quandt,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究收集了一个美国手语（ASL）STEM（科学、技术、工程和数学）对话的动作捕捉数据集，以量化比较双人互动手语、单独手语讲座和翻译文章。使用连续运动特征，我们分离出对话特定的适应与个体努力减少，并展示重复提及STEM术语时的时空变化。对话手势平均比孤立手势短24.6%-44.6%，并且在独白情境中没有显著减少。最后，我们在识别STEM手势的能力上评估了手语嵌入模型，并近似了参与者随时间的适应程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数最先进的手语模型是在翻译员或孤立词汇数据上训练的，这忽略了自然对话中特有的变异性。然而，人类交流通过时空变化和表达风格动态适应上下文和对话者。这在教育环境中尤其明显，其中教师和学生使用新的词汇。

Method: 我们使用连续运动特征，将对话特定的适应与个体努力减少分开，并展示了重复提及STEM术语时的时空变化。

Result: 平均而言，对话手势比孤立手势短24.6%-44.6%，并且在独白情境中没有显著减少。最后，我们在识别STEM手势的能力上评估了手语嵌入模型，并近似了参与者随时间的适应程度。

Conclusion: 我们的研究弥合了语言分析和计算建模之间的差距，以理解语用如何塑造手语的表达及其在手语技术中的表示。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art sign language models are trained on interpreter or
isolated vocabulary data, which overlooks the variability that characterizes
natural dialogue. However, human communication dynamically adapts to contexts
and interlocutors through spatiotemporal changes and articulation style. This
specifically manifests itself in educational settings, where novel vocabularies
are used by teachers, and students. To address this gap, we collect a motion
capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison
between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted
articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific
entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes
across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are
24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant
reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding
models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained
the participants become over time. Our study bridges linguistic analysis and
computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and
its representation in sign language technologies.

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn
conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic
environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by
default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the
real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability
when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has
passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often
either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or
under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,
we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across
34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user
question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed
since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue
messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and
evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,
creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous
observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call
(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with
human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show
that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than
random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding
timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the
improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive,
prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the
need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with
human temporal perception.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估方法Combo-Eval和一个专门的数据集NLR-BIRD，用于评估LLM生成的自然语言表示，结果表明该方法在减少LLM调用次数的同时，能够更准确地反映人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前，LLM在生成自然语言表示时存在信息丢失或错误的问题，而这一领域仍缺乏有效的评估方法和专门的数据集。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的评估方法Combo-Eval，结合了多种现有方法的优点，优化了评估精度，并减少了LLM调用次数。同时，还推出了NLR-BIRD数据集用于NLR基准测试。

Result: Combo-Eval方法在评估LLM生成的自然语言表示方面表现出色，能够显著减少LLM调用次数（25-61%），并且在有无参考的情况下都能保持良好的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Combo-Eval评估方法和NLR-BIRD数据集，展示了其在LLM生成的自然语言表示方面的优越性，并通过人类评估验证了其与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OraPlan-SQL是一个用于Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge 2025的系统，通过代理框架和反馈引导的元提示策略，在复杂推理任务中取得了优异的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge 2025中的复杂推理任务，如算术、常识和假设推理，同时处理多语言场景中的翻译和实体不匹配问题。

Method: OraPlan-SQL采用了一个代理框架，包括规划代理和SQL代理。规划代理生成逐步的自然语言计划，而SQL代理将这些计划转换为可执行的SQL。通过反馈引导的元提示策略优化规划代理，并引入实体链接指南以处理多语言场景中的问题。此外，通过计划多样化提高可靠性。

Result: OraPlan-SQL在英语和中文中的执行准确率分别为55.0%和56.7%，超过第二名系统超过6%。同时保持了超过99%的SQL有效性。

Conclusion: OraPlan-SQL在Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge 2025中取得了优异的成绩，展示了其在复杂推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge
2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding
the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0%
in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA).
Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that
generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these
plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our
refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple
sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a
feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure
cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills
them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system
prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual
scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate
entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities
and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability
through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each
query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output
selected via majority voting over their executions.

without model fine-tuning. Applied to neuropsychological assessments, it
achieves accurate and reliable performance even with minimal training data,
showing promise for early-stage Alzheimer's monitoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了AfriMTEB和AfriE5，以解决非洲语言在文本嵌入任务中的不足，并取得了优异的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务通常从翻译基准如FLORES聚类或SIB-200中重新利用，非洲语言在MMTEB中仍然代表性不足。

Method: 通过跨语言对比蒸馏将instruction-tuned mE5模型适应到非洲语言，引入了AfriMTEB和AfriE5。

Result: AfriMTEB覆盖59种语言、14项任务和38个数据集，包括六个新添加的数据集；AfriE5在性能上优于Gemini-Embeddings和mE5。

Conclusion: AfriE5在评估中表现出色，优于如Gemini-Embeddings和mE5等强基线模型。

Abstract: Text embeddings are an essential building component of several NLP tasks such
as retrieval-augmented generation which is crucial for preventing
hallucinations in LLMs. Despite the recent release of massively multilingual
MTEB (MMTEB), African languages remain underrepresented, with existing tasks
often repurposed from translation benchmarks such as FLORES clustering or
SIB-200. In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB
covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added
datasets. Unlike many MMTEB datasets that include fewer than five languages,
the new additions span 14 to 56 African languages and introduce entirely new
tasks, such as hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion
classification, which were not previously covered. Complementing this, we
present AfriE5, an adaptation of the instruction-tuned mE5 model to African
languages through cross-lingual contrastive distillation. Our evaluation shows
that AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong
baselines such as Gemini-Embeddings and mE5.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的增强框架，用于评估大型语言模型中的偏见行为。结果显示，这些模型对输入扰动敏感，并且在目标人口群体研究较少的情况下，更容易表现出刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已经开发出一些方法和模型来避免在决策中使用刻板信息，但最近的研究表明，用于偏差对齐的方法是脆弱的。因此，需要一种更稳健的方法来评估和减少LLMs中的偏见。

Method: 本文引入了一种新的通用增强框架，包含三个即插即用的步骤，并适用于多个公平性评估基准。通过将增强应用于公平性评估数据集（BBQ），分析了LLMs的偏见行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs（包括最先进的开源和闭源模型）对输入扰动敏感，并且在目标人口群体研究较少的情况下，更容易表现出偏见行为。

Conclusion: 本文指出，大型语言模型（LLMs）在面对输入扰动时容易表现出刻板印象，并且在目标人口群体研究较少的情况下，更容易出现偏见行为。因此，需要扩展公平性和安全性研究以涵盖更多样化的社区。

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

Motivation: 我们希望通过使用LLM生成的提示来提高现有最先进的方法，并节省计算资源。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于代理的方法，利用指令遵循的LLM进行自动化声明匹配任务。该方法包括两个步骤：首先生成提示，然后将声明匹配作为二分类任务进行处理。

Result: LLM生成的提示可以优于人类生成的提示，并且较小的LLM在生成过程中可以与较大的LLM一样有效。此外，使用不同的LLM进行每个步骤的管道也被证明是有效的。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了LLM在声明匹配任务中的理解，并展示了使用不同LLM进行每个步骤的有效性。

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task
with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first
generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary
classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can
outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as
well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational
resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for
each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another
for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in
turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Motivation: 传统的方法需要大量的训练标签和模型微调，而我们的方法可以自动适应不同的产品类别和属性，提高效率。

Method: 我们引入了一种无需训练的级联自动提示方法，通过自动生成和优化提示来评估产品属性质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，自动提示级联在精度和召回率上比传统链式思维提示提高了8-10%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个语言和质量评估任务中表现出色，同时显著减少了领域专家的工作时间。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

Abstract: We present a connectome-informed LLM framework that encodes dynamic fMRI
connectivity as temporal sequences, applies robust normalization, and maps
these data into a representation suitable for a frozen pre-trained LLM for
clinical prediction. Applied to early Alzheimer's detection, our method
achieves sensitive prediction with error rates well below clinically recognized
margins, with implications for timely Alzheimer's intervention.

### [15] [Uncovering the Potential Risks in Unlearning: Danger of English-only Unlearning in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23949)
*Kyomin Hwang,Hyeonjin Kim,Seungyeon Kim,Sunghyun Wee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言LLM在完全微调后进行无学习时出现的语言混淆现象，并提出了基于N-gram的语言混合（N-Mix）分数来量化该现象，同时指出参考基础度量在高N-Mix分数下会产生假阴性，建议采用语义基础度量进行无学习评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示，仅使用英语数据尝试擦除多语言知识对于多语言LLM是不够的，而他们的分析仍然高度以性能为导向。本文从评估的角度出发，解决了一个额外的盲点，即当多语言LLM完全微调后进行无学习时出现的语言混淆现象。

Method: 引入基于N-gram的语言混合（N-Mix）分数来定量展示语言混淆在多语言LLM中是普遍且一致的，演示参考基础度量在N-Mix分数高时会导致假阴性，并建议需要新的无学习评估方法。

Result: 语言混淆是一个问题现象，在无学习中导致标准参考基础度量失效。通过N-Mix分数展示语言混淆的普遍性和一致性，证明参考基础度量在N-Mix分数高时会产生假阴性，并建议需要新的语义基础度量。

Conclusion: 本文提出需要新的无学习评估方法，即语义基础度量，以直接评估生成句子的内容。

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

*Mengzhou Sun,Sendong Zhao,Jianyu Chen,Haochun Wang,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为M-Eval的新方法，用于解决RAG在医疗问答系统中的问题，通过使用多源证据来检查事实错误，并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG应用在医疗问答系统中存在生成错误信息和未能正确使用外部知识的问题。因此，需要一种新的方法来提高RAG系统的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 本文提出的方法M-Eval受到循证医学中异质性分析方法的启发，用于检查RAG响应中的事实错误。首先从外部知识库中提取额外的医学文献，然后检索RAG系统生成的证据文档，并使用异质性分析来检查这些证据是否支持响应中的不同观点。

Result: 本文提出的方法在各种LLMs上实现了高达23.31%的准确性提升，有助于检测当前基于RAG的医疗系统中的错误，并使LLMs的应用更加可靠，减少诊断错误。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为M-Eval的新方法，以解决当前RAG在医疗问答系统中的问题。该方法通过使用来自多个来源的证据来检查RAG响应中的事实错误，并提高了不同LLMs的准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing
medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language
models (LLMs) with external medical literature. LLMs can retrieve relevant
medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However,
current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect
information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge
correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This
method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG
responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional
medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the
evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis
to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In
addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the
reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an
improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help
detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the
applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.

*Mengzhou Sun,Sendong Zhao,Jianyu Chen,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PICOs-RAG的方法，以改进基于检索增强生成（RAG）的医学文献检索过程，从而提高大型语言模型在循证医学（EBM）中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RAG方法在处理真实临床场景中的复杂查询时存在困难，例如当查询缺乏某些信息或使用不精确的语言时，模型可能会检索到无关证据并生成无用答案。

Method: 提出PICOs-RAG方法，将用户查询扩展为更好的格式，并使用PICO格式提取最重要的信息用于检索。

Result: 该方法显著提高了检索效率和相关性，与基线相比，提升了高达8.8%。

Conclusion: PICOs-RAG可以提高大型语言模型在EBM中的性能，使其成为有用且可靠的医疗助手。

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount
importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for
the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical
accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant
literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,
researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence
and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to
handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when
queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may
retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this
issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better
format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones
and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the
most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly
enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\%
improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the
PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful
and reliable medical assistant in EBM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法来重新排序和筛选医学证据，通过结合多种EBM方法，提高RAG提取高质量和可靠证据的能力，并在实验中展示了准确率的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBM在临床应用中起着至关重要的作用。研究人员发现，使用大型语言模型（LLMs）技术如RAG进行EBM任务是高效的。然而，EBM对证据有严格的要求，RAG在EBM中的应用难以高效地区分高质量的证据。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的方法来重新排序和筛选医学证据。这种方法提出了多个原则，以筛选出最适合LLMs诊断的最佳证据。我们采用了几种EBM方法的组合来模拟系统综述，包括可靠性分析、异质性分析和外推分析。

Result: 我们在实验中评估了这些高质量的文章，并展示了准确率提高了11.4%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法成功使RAG从PubMed数据集中提取更高质量和更可靠的知识证据。这项工作可以减少错误知识的注入，并帮助用户获得更有效的回复。

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application.
Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of
misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs)
techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent
requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently
distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis
used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical
evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence
for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate
the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis,
and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the
best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality
articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and
results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more
reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of
incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective
replies.

*Yizhu Jiao,Sha Li,Sizhe Zhou,Heng Ji,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的信息抽取任务TEXT2DB，并引入了OPAL框架，以更好地整合IE输出和目标数据库。实验表明OPAL能够适应不同的数据库模式，但也面临一些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于IE本体与下游应用需求之间的不匹配，IE输出往往难以直接使用。因此，需要一种新的方法来更好地整合IE输出和目标数据库。

Method: 提出了一种新的IE任务TEXT2DB，强调将IE输出与目标数据库（或知识库）集成。引入了一个新的基准测试，以及一个LLM代理框架OPAL，包括Observer组件、Planner组件和Analyzer组件。

Result: OPAL能够成功适应不同的数据库模式，生成不同的代码计划并调用所需的IE模型。同时，实验还展示了处理大型数据库和复杂依赖关系以及提取幻觉等困难情况的挑战。

Conclusion: OPAL可以成功适应不同的数据库模式，通过生成不同的代码计划并调用所需的IE模型。同时，作者指出了处理大型数据库和复杂依赖关系以及提取幻觉等困难情况需要进一步研究。

Abstract: The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge
from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to
the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We
propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE
output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a
document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the
database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction.
This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and
adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate
this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as
data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an
LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer
component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that
generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component
that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments
show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating
different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight
difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies
and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

### [20] [Teaching LLMs to Abstain via Fine-Grained Semantic Confidence Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24020)
*Hao An,Yang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于细粒度语义置信度奖励的强化学习框架，以提高大型语言模型在回答问题时的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻大型语言模型（LLMs）中的幻觉对于其可靠部署至关重要。现有的方法通常微调LLMs以避免回答超出其知识范围的问题。然而，这些方法通常依赖于粗粒度信号来指导LLM回避，例如多个采样答案的整体置信度或不确定性分数，这可能导致模型对自己知识边界的不精确认知。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于细粒度语义置信度奖励的强化学习框架，通过样本特定的置信度引导LLM回避。具体来说，我们的方法通过采样多个候选答案并进行语义聚类，然后训练LLM保留高置信度簇中的答案并丢弃低置信度簇中的答案，从而促进准确的后期回避。

Result: 我们的方法在域内和分布外基准中显著提高了可靠性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在域内和分布外基准中显著提高了可靠性。

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Yadong Zhang,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SpecKD的新方法，通过引入动态的、基于令牌级别的门控机制，提高了知识蒸馏的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more powerful.

Method: Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic, token-level gating mechanism inspired by the 'propose-and-verify' paradigm of speculative decoding.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SpecKD consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种训练大型多模态模型形成语言惯例的方法，使它们能够更高效地与人类沟通。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类利用共享的对话上下文来提高沟通的成功率和效率，这包括形成临时的语言惯例。我们希望训练模型也能够这样做。

Method: 我们提出了一种训练大型多模态模型形成惯例的方法，该方法使用模拟参考游戏，不需要额外的人类生成数据。

Result: 在涉及照片和拼图图像的重复参考游戏中，我们的方法使模型能够以更短的消息长度和更高的成功率与人类沟通。

Conclusion: 我们的方法使模型能够与人类高效沟通，并且在形成惯例方面表现出色。

Abstract: Humans leverage shared conversational context to become increasingly
successful and efficient at communicating over time. One manifestation of this
is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to
coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared
conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to
form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated
reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.
In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our
method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the
message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of
the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model
that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost
alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.

TL;DR: Pie是一个可编程的LLM服务系统，通过分解传统的生成循环并利用WebAssembly执行用户提供的程序，实现了更高的灵活性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的服务系统在处理新兴的大型语言模型应用时，由于需要多样化的推理策略和代理工作流，其能力受到了限制。因此，需要一种更灵活和高效的LLM服务系统。

Method: Pie是一个可编程的LLM服务系统，它将传统的生成循环分解为细粒度的服务处理程序，并通过API暴露这些处理程序。用户提供的程序（称为inferlets）负责控制生成过程。Pie使用WebAssembly执行inferlets，从而受益于其轻量级沙箱环境。

Result: Pie在标准任务上的性能与最先进的系统相当（3-12%的延迟开销），而在代理工作流中显著提高了延迟和吞吐量（1.3x-3.4倍）。

Conclusion: Pie通过将传统的生成循环分解为细粒度的服务处理程序，并利用WebAssembly执行用户提供的程序，实现了灵活性和效率的提升。评估结果显示，Pie在标准任务上达到了最先进的性能，并在代理工作流中显著提高了延迟和吞吐量。

Abstract: Emerging large language model (LLM) applications involve diverse reasoning
strategies and agentic workflows, straining the capabilities of existing
serving systems built on a monolithic token generation loop. This paper
introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and
efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained
service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation
process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications
to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly
integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without
requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using
WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows
Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency
overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x
higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个诊断框架和 HalloMTBench 基准，用于检测多语言 LLM 中的幻觉问题，并展示了其在评估 17 个 LLM 时的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 MT 基准无法揭示多语言 LLM 中的失败情况。为了揭示多语言 LLM 中的幻觉，我们需要一个能够区分指令偏离和源偏离的分类框架。

Method: 我们引入了一个诊断框架，并创建了 HalloMTBench，这是一个跨 11 种英语到其他语言方向的多语言、人工验证的基准。我们使用了 4 个前沿 LLM 生成候选，并通过 LLM 判官的集合和专家验证来审查这些候选。

Result: 我们评估了 17 个 LLM 在 HalloMTBench 上的表现。结果揭示了不同的“幻觉触发器”——独特的失败模式反映了模型规模、源长度敏感性、语言偏见以及强化学习（RL）放大语言混合。

Conclusion: HalloMTBench 提供了一个前瞻性测试平台，用于诊断 LLM 翻译失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain
vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not
capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in
multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that
separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this
taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark
across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate
candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and
expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have
evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination
triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length
sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified
language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing
LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in

TL;DR: Global PIQA is a culturally-specific evaluation benchmark for large language models, covering over 100 languages and highlighting the need for improvement in everyday knowledge across various languages and cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and cultures.

Method: Global PIQA is a participatory commonsense reasoning benchmark constructed by hand by 335 researchers from 65 countries around the world, covering over 100 languages, five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing systems.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally perform worse than proprietary models.

Conclusion: Global PIQA highlights that in many languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement, alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, Global PIQA provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language is embedded.

Abstract: To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for
large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and
cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense
reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335
researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in
Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing
systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples
reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific
elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in
aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up
to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally
perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many
languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement,
alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and
expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA
provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language
is embedded.

Motivation: Bengali 语言在南亚和海外社区中广泛使用，但对其计算处理的研究仍然有限。本研究旨在填补这一空白，以促进方言多样性的保护和包容性数字工具的发展。

Method: 本研究通过记录和分析 Bengali 方言的语音和形态特征，探索构建针对地区变体的计算模型的可行性，特别是自动语音识别（ASR）系统。

Result: 本研究创建了一个数据集，用于公开使用，并探索了构建针对地区变体的计算模型的可行性。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在记录和分析这些方言的语音和形态特征，并探索构建针对地区变体的计算模型的可行性，特别是自动语音识别（ASR）系统。这种努力在虚拟助手和更广泛的语言技术中具有应用潜力，有助于保护方言多样性并推动包容性数字工具的发展。

Abstract: The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among
diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by
geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based
classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern
Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further
distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as
observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali,
and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the
computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks
to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these
dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models
particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional
varieties. Such efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants
and broader language technologies, contributing to both the preservation of
dialectal diversity and the advancement of inclusive digital tools for
Bengali-speaking communities. The dataset created for this study is released
for public use.

Motivation: 尽管文本到SQL技术取得了显著进展，但在实际系统中部署这些技术仍然面临挑战，因为集成工具有限。因此，需要一种统一、模块化且广泛的文本到SQL框架来整合研究成果和实际应用。

Method: Squrve首先建立了一个通用的执行范式，标准化了调用接口，然后提出了基于七个抽象的有效原子组件的多代理协作机制。

Result: 在广泛采用的基准测试中进行的实验表明，协作工作流始终优于原始的个体方法。

Conclusion: Squrve为解决复杂现实查询提供了一种新的有效途径，实验表明协作工作流优于原始个体方法。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL technology has evolved rapidly, with diverse academic methods
achieving impressive results. However, deploying these techniques in real-world
systems remains challenging due to limited integration tools. Despite these
advances, we introduce Squrve, a unified, modular, and extensive Text-to-SQL
framework designed to bring together research advances and real-world
applications. Squrve first establishes a universal execution paradigm that
standardizes invocation interfaces, then proposes a multi-actor collaboration
mechanism based on seven abstracted effective atomic actor components.
Experiments on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that the collaborative
workflows consistently outperform the original individual methods, thereby
opening up a new effective avenue for tackling complex real-world queries. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的行级过滤技术，如行级去重和尾部标点过滤，虽然常用，但有时会丢弃有价值的内容，从而对下游性能产生负面影响。

Method: 我们引入了两种方法——模式感知的行级去重（PLD）和模式感知的尾部标点过滤（PTF），通过增强传统的过滤技术来改进现有的方法。

Result: 我们在英语和韩语中训练了小型语言模型（1B参数），结果表明我们的方法在多个选择题基准测试中表现更好，并显著提升了生成式问答的准确率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个选择题基准测试中一致提高了性能，并显著提升了SQuAD v1和KorQuAD v1上的生成式问答准确率。

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level
deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters, are commonly used, these basic
methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream
performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level
deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by
enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative
question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MuSaG，这是第一个德语多模态讽刺检测数据集，包含从德国电视节目手动选择和人工标注的33分钟陈述。我们对九种开源和商业模型进行了基准测试，并发现模型在文本上表现最佳，而人类在对话环境中更依赖音频。这突显了当前多模态模型的不足，并促使使用MuSaG来开发更适合现实场景的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺是一种复杂的隐喻语言形式，其意图含义与字面含义相矛盾。它在社交媒体和流行文化中的普遍性给自然语言理解、情感分析和内容审核带来了持续的挑战。随着多模态大语言模型的出现，讽刺检测超越了文本，需要整合来自音频和视觉的线索。

Method: 我们提出了MuSaG，这是第一个德语多模态讽刺检测数据集，包含从德国电视节目手动选择和人工标注的33分钟陈述。每个实例提供对齐的文本、音频和视频模态，由人类分别进行标注，使在单模态和多模态设置中进行评估成为可能。我们对九种开源和商业模型进行了基准测试，涵盖文本、音频、视觉和多模态架构，并将其性能与人类标注进行比较。

Result: 我们的结果表明，虽然人类在对话环境中高度依赖音频，但模型在文本上表现最佳。这突显了当前多模态模型的不足，并促使使用MuSaG来开发更适合现实场景的模型。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，虽然人类在对话环境中高度依赖音频，但模型在文本上表现最佳。这突显了当前多模态模型的不足，并促使使用MuSaG来开发更适合现实场景的模型。我们公开发布MuSaG以支持未来关于多模态讽刺检测和人机对齐的研究。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in
conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in
current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models
better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support
future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在探索外部知识整合在自然语言生成（NLG）中的影响，特别是在常识生成任务中。

Method: 我们扩展了CommonGen数据集，创建了一个名为KITGI的基准，该基准将输入概念集与从ConceptNet检索到的语义关系配对，并包括手动注释的输出。使用T5-Large模型，我们在两种条件下比较句子生成：完整外部知识和过滤知识（故意移除了高度相关的关系）。我们的可解释性基准采用三阶段方法：(1) 识别和移除关键知识，(2) 重新生成句子，(3) 手动评估输出的常识合理性和概念覆盖。

Result: 结果显示，使用完整知识生成的句子在两个标准上的正确率达到91%，而过滤知识则显著降低至6%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，相关外部知识对于保持自然语言生成（NLG）中的连贯性和概念覆盖至关重要。这项工作强调了设计可解释的知识增强型NLG系统的重要性，并呼吁评估框架能够捕捉表面指标之外的推理过程。

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of external knowledge integration in
Natural Language Generation (NLG), focusing on a commonsense generation task.
We extend the CommonGen dataset by creating KITGI, a benchmark that pairs input
concept sets with retrieved semantic relations from ConceptNet and includes
manually annotated outputs. Using the T5-Large model, we compare sentence
generation under two conditions: with full external knowledge and with filtered
knowledge where highly relevant relations were deliberately removed. Our
interpretability benchmark follows a three-stage method: (1) identifying and
removing key knowledge, (2) regenerating sentences, and (3) manually assessing
outputs for commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Results show that
sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91\% correctness across both
criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6\%. These
findings demonstrate that relevant external knowledge is critical for
maintaining both coherence and concept coverage in NLG. This work highlights
the importance of designing interpretable, knowledge-enhanced NLG systems and
calls for evaluation frameworks that capture the underlying reasoning beyond
surface-level metrics.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于潜在空间语义对齐的跨尺度知识迁移方法，该方法在四个基准测试中表现出色，并揭示了促进跨尺度知识迁移的关键因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识和确定性的幻觉分类框架，并验证了其有效性。研究发现，不同模型在知识和幻觉模式上存在差异，且一些缓解方法在特定情况下效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究通常根据幻觉的外部属性进行分类，而不是基于LLM的内部属性。这种外部关注忽略了幻觉可能需要基于其潜在机制的定制缓解策略。

Method: 我们提出了一个框架，根据知识和确定性两个轴对幻觉进行分类，并通过模型特定的数据集构建过程来区分这些类型的幻觉。我们应用了引导缓解方法来验证知识轴上的分类，并引入了一个新的评估指标来衡量缓解方法在特定幻觉子集上的效果。

Result: 我们的框架验证了知识轴上的幻觉分类，并展示了两种幻觉类型之间的显著差异。我们进一步分析了模型之间的知识和幻觉模式，发现即使在共享参数知识的情况下，不同的幻觉仍然会发生。此外，我们发现了一些模型在拥有正确知识的情况下仍以确定性进行幻觉的情况，并揭示了某些缓解方法在这些关键案例中的表现不佳。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了在分析幻觉时考虑知识和确定性的必要性，并呼吁针对幻觉的潜在因素采取有针对性的缓解方法。

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage.
Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external
properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This
external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation
strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for
categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since
parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization
method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that
differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,
we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those
occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To
validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,
which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model
activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge
categorization by showing a significant difference between the two
hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and
hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do
occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we
identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models
hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We
introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation
methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on
average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in
hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that
consider the hallucination underlying factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗保健环境中，大型语言模型产生的解释如果不忠实于推动其预测的因素，可能会损害临床医生的信任并导致不安全的决策支持。

Method: 我们评估了三种大型语言模型（GPT-4.1-mini，LLaMA 70B，LLaMA 8B）在两个数据集（BBQ和MedQA）上的表现，并操纵了少量示例的数量和类型、提示策略和训练过程。

Result: 结果表明：（i）少量示例的数量和质量显著影响模型的忠实度；（ii）忠实度对提示设计敏感；（iii）在MedQA上，指令调优阶段提高了测量的忠实度。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果提供了增强敏感领域中大型语言模型的可解释性和可信度的策略见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not
faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare
settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit
salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust
and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time
choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can
control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA
8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),
and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,
and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of
few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is
sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves
measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies
for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive
domains.

Motivation: 我们旨在通过结合文本和语音信息来提高阿拉伯语方言句子的重音恢复效果。

Method: 我们提出了一种结合文本和语音信息的多模态方法来解决阿拉伯语方言句子的重音恢复（DR）任务。文本模态使用从我们自己的预训练模型CATT中提取的编码器表示。语音部分由OpenAI Whisper基础模型的编码器模块处理。我们的解决方案遵循两种集成策略：一种是在早期阶段融合语音标记和输入，另一种是利用交叉注意将文本和语音嵌入融合。

Result: 我们的实验表明，所提出的方法在开发集上达到了0.25的词错误率（WER）和0.9的字符错误率（CER）。在测试集上，我们的模型分别达到了0.55和0.13的WER和CER分数。

Conclusion: 我们的实验表明，所提出的方法在开发集上达到了0.25的词错误率（WER）和0.9的字符错误率（CER）。在测试集上，我们的模型分别达到了0.55和0.13的WER和CER分数。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic
dialectal sentences using a multimodal approach that combines both textual and
speech information. We propose a model that represents the text modality using
an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech
component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.
Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former
consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where
the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,
resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these
averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to
merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the
CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text
and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the
CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further
improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during
training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of
0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the
test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估大型语言模型在生成适合儿童年龄的挪威语对话方面的表现，并探讨在低资源语言中开发专门应用的挑战。

Method: 通过让十一位教育专业人士对真实儿童访谈数据和LLM生成的文本样本进行盲评，评估了五个不同LLM（GPT-4、RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b、GPTSW、NorMistral-7b和NorBloom-7b）生成适合儿童年龄的挪威语对话的能力。

Result: 评估者在预测较年幼儿童（5岁）的年龄方面比预测较年长儿童（9岁）的年龄更准确，且GPT-4和NorBloom-7b的表现相对较好，但大多数模型生成的语言被认为比目标年龄组的语言更为先进。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了在为涉及儿童的专门应用开发大型语言模型系统时，数据相关挑战的重要性，特别是在缺乏全面的年龄适当词汇资源的低资源语言中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly trained on adult conversational
data, face significant challenges when generating authentic, child-like
dialogue for specialized applications. We present a comparative study
evaluating five different LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b,
and NorBloom-7b) to generate age-appropriate Norwegian conversations for
children aged 5 and 9 years. Through a blind evaluation by eleven education
professionals using both real child interview data and LLM-generated text
samples, we assessed authenticity and developmental appropriateness. Our
results show that evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75)
and demonstrated higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children
(5-year-olds) compared to older children (9-year-olds). While GPT-4 and
NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, most models generated language perceived

highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for
specialized applications involving children, particularly in low-resource

*Jack Merullo,Srihita Vatsavaya,Lucius Bushnaq,Owen Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了变压器模型中的记忆表示，并提出了一种基于损失景观曲率的分解方法来分离记忆。这种方法在减少非目标记忆数据的重复方面比现有方法更有效，同时保持较低的困惑度。此外，我们发现某些任务如事实检索和算术任务受到严重影响，而其他任务如逻辑推理则得到保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们希望了解记忆如何在变压器模型中表示，并找到一种有效的方法来抑制非目标记忆数据的重复，同时保持较低的困惑度。

Method: 我们基于损失景观曲率的分解来表征记忆在变压器模型中的表示，并使用这种分解来分离语言模型（LMs）和视觉变压器（ViTs）中的记忆。我们还分析了这种编辑过程对下游任务的影响。

Result: 我们发现这种编辑过程在减少非目标记忆数据的重复方面比最近的遗忘方法（BalancedSubnet）更有效，同时保持较低的困惑度。此外，我们发现事实检索和算术任务受到严重影响，而开放书事实检索和一般逻辑推理则得到保留。

Conclusion: 我们的工作增强了对神经网络中记忆的理解，并在去除记忆方面有实际应用，还提供了关于解决数学和事实检索等任务的特异性、狭窄使用的结构的证据。

Abstract: We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and
show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)
and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss
landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical
work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper
than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low
curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a
weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted
memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method
(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of
curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,
we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks
in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and
consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and
general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on
specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,
regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support
this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with
low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance
after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural
networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence
for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math
and fact retrieval.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在将自然语言翻译成内部符号表示方面存在局限性，需要进一步研究语言与内部代理表示之间的对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能够将人类自然语言指令翻译成层次强化学习中出现的内部符号表示。

Method: 应用结构化评估框架来测量常见大型语言模型（GPT、Claude、Deepseek 和 Grok）在不同内部符号分区中的翻译性能。

Result: 尽管大型语言模型表现出一定的将自然语言翻译成环境动态符号表示的能力，但其性能高度依赖于分区粒度和任务复杂性。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在将自然语言翻译成内部符号表示方面存在局限性，需要进一步研究语言与内部代理表示之间的稳健对齐。

Abstract: Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental
learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we
investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural
language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge
during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation
framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT,
Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions
generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze
and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate
some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of
the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition
granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs
capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further
research on robust alignment between language and internal agent
representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动生成NLI问题变体的方法，并发现NLI模型在这些变体上的表现较差，显示出泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建新的基准测试成本高昂，而自动生成高质量的基准测试非常困难。

Method: 提出了一种自动生成高质量NLI问题变体的方法，通过替换开放类词，同时保持其基本推理。

Result: NLI模型在生成的变体上的表现比原始问题差4-20%，表明其泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: NLI模型在MERGE测试中的表现较差，表明它们在面对经过最小修改的问题时泛化能力较低。

Abstract: In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models'
lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually
creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality
ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality
variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while
crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test
as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the
correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the
original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on
variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered
problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability,
and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.

*Shangyu Xing,Siyuan Wang,Chenyuan Yang,Xinyu Dai,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的滚动策略Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR)，以提高强化学习中轨迹的多样性，并在多个任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的强化学习管道中存在一个关键瓶颈，即在群体滚动过程中采样的轨迹多样性有限。由于令牌级别的随机采样，局部变化可能会坍缩为几乎相同的推理路径，这会降低政策更新的回报信号，从而阻碍有效的政策学习。

Method: 本文提出了Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR)策略，该策略通过在高不确定性生成步骤中进行分支、对每个新分支进行前瞻模拟以及在模拟中显示长时间相似性的分支进行剪枝来促进轨迹级别的多样性。

Result: 与随机采样相比，LATR平均加速了政策学习131%，并在GRPO和DAPO算法上提高了最终pass@1性能4.2%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的滚动策略Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR)，旨在通过在高不确定性生成步骤中强制分支来促进轨迹级别的多样性。实验结果表明，与随机采样相比，LATR平均加速了政策学习131%，并在GRPO和DAPO算法上提高了最终pass@1性能4.2%。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with
algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly
effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited
diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous
trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for
policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of
diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local
variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To
address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a
novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level
diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to
yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three
stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing
lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that
exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic
Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves
final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy
Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Critique-RL is a novel approach for training critiquing language models without relying on stronger supervision, achieving significant performance improvements in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for training critiquing language models rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data, which is not ideal. The goal is to develop a method that does not require such supervision.

Method: Critique-RL is an online RL approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision, using a two-player paradigm where the actor generates responses and the critic provides feedback. It employs a two-stage optimization strategy to enhance discriminability and helpfulness.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Critique-RL achieves significant performance gains, such as 9.02% on in-domain tasks and 5.70% on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B.

Conclusion: Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements, highlighting its potential in enhancing the quality of LLMs through effective critiquing.

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a
5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全面的方法，用于评估大型语言模型在阿拉伯语方言和文化相关内容上的表现，并扩展了一个现有数据集，以支持更广泛的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content remains uneven across languages.

Method: We propose a comprehensive method that translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into English and several Arabic dialects, converts them into open-ended questions (OEQs), benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and generates chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning.

Result: Models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics.

Conclusion: The developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本生成基准通常评估现实世界查询，但使用难以验证的指标或使用简化评估的合成设置，忽略了现实世界的复杂性。

Method: LongWeave引入了Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval)，通过在现实场景中定义可验证的目标，然后系统地生成相应的查询、文本材料和约束来构建任务，从而平衡了现实世界和可验证的评估。

Result: LongWeave支持七个不同的任务，并且可以自定义输入/输出长度（最多64K/8K个标记）。对23个LLM的评估显示，即使最先进的模型在长文本生成方面也面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: LongWeave展示了即使最先进的模型在面对现实世界的复杂性和输出长度增加时，仍然在长文本生成方面面临重大挑战。

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们探索了在文本简化背景下，解码句子嵌入以给出原始文本的近似值的效果，并展示了重建的文本嵌入保留了复杂性水平。

Method: 我们实验了一个小型的前馈神经网络，以有效地学习高复杂性和低复杂性文本的句子嵌入之间的转换。

Result: 我们的方法在较小的学习设置中与基于Seq2Seq和LLM的方法进行了比较，结果令人鼓舞。此外，我们的转换适用于未见过的简化数据集（MedEASI）以及训练数据之外的语言数据集（ES,DE）。

Conclusion: 学习句子嵌入空间中的转换是未来研究的一个有前景的方向，并有可能解锁开发小型但强大的模型的能力，用于文本简化和其他自然语言生成任务。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings can be decoded to give approximations of the original
texts used to create them. We explore this effect in the context of text
simplification, demonstrating that reconstructed text embeddings preserve
complexity levels. We experiment with a small feed forward neural network to
effectively learn a transformation between sentence embeddings representing
high-complexity and low-complexity texts. We provide comparison to a Seq2Seq
and LLM-based approach, showing encouraging results in our much smaller
learning setting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as
datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE). We conclude that
learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction
for future research and has potential to unlock the ability to develop small,
but powerful models for text simplification and other natural language
generation tasks.

Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏方法受到手动编写的指令数量和质量的限制，并且大规模用户文本计算成本高，影响实用性。

Method: 我们引入了COMPEFFDIST框架，包含基于属性的自动指令构建和基于难度的数据过滤两个关键模块。

Result: 在多个模型系列（Llama-3、Qwen-3和Gemma-3）上应用我们的方法，使3B学生模型在大多数任务上达到20倍大教师模型的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在数据效率方面显著优于基线方法，仅使用10%的数据就能达到相同的性能水平。

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop
lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded
in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising
results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are
limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure
comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur
high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this
end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation
framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules:
attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data
filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying
our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we
enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models
on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods
in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the
data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SynthWorlds框架，用于分离任务推理复杂度与事实知识。通过构建两个具有相同结构的世界（真实映射世界和合成映射世界），设计了多跳问答和页面导航任务，以评估语言模型的推理能力和记忆能力。实验表明，模型在参数化世界知识上仍有优势，这为系统改进提供了机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and approaches cannot cleanly separate the two.

Method: We present SynthWorlds, a framework that disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds, we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal reasoning difficulty across worlds.

Result: Experiments in parametric-only (e.g., closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting opportunities for system improvements.

Conclusion: SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of reasoning and memorization.

Motivation: The effectiveness of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is often limited in low-resource linguistic settings due to a lack of high-quality training data.

Method: We introduce LuxIT, a novel, monolingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish developed to mitigate this challenge. We synthesize the dataset from a corpus of native Luxembourgish texts, utilizing DeepSeek-R1-0528, chosen for its shown proficiency in Luxembourgish. Following generation, we apply a quality assurance process, employing an LLM-as-a-judge approach. To investigate the practical utility of the dataset, we fine-tune several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT.

Result: Subsequent benchmarking against their base models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models.

Conclusion: LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings highlight the need for further research to optimize its application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在伊斯兰指导中的使用日益增加，但存在误引文本、误用教法或产生文化不一致回应的风险，因此需要对这些模型进行评估。

Method: 本文采用双代理框架进行评估，包括一个用于引用验证和六维评分（例如结构、伊斯兰一致性、引用）的定量代理，以及一个用于五维并排比较（例如语气、深度、原创性）的定性代理。

Result: GPT-4o在伊斯兰准确性（3.93）和引用（3.38）方面得分最高，Ansari AI紧随其后（3.68, 3.32），而Fanar则落后（2.76, 1.82）。尽管表现相对较强，但这些模型在可靠地生成准确的伊斯兰内容和引用方面仍存在不足。

Conclusion: 本文强调了需要以穆斯林视角为中心的社区驱动基准，为伊斯兰知识和其他高风险领域（如医学、法律和新闻业）的更可靠的人工智能提供了早期步骤。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk
misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally
inconsistent responses. We pilot an evaluation of GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar
on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a
quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g.,
Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for
five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality).
GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI
followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong
performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic
content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing.
GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led
qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces
innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need
for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an
early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes
domains such as medicine, law, and journalism.

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在扰动图像输入上，而语义等效的文本改写在实际应用中至关重要，因此需要进一步探索。

Method: 本文引入了一种新的对抗性改写任务，生成语法正确且保留原始查询含义但会降低分割性能的改写文本。此外，提出了一种名为SPARTA的黑盒、句子级优化方法，该方法在文本自编码器的低维语义潜在空间中运行，并由强化学习指导。

Result: SPARTA在ReasonSeg和LLMSeg-40k数据集上的成功率显著提高，比之前的方法高出两倍。同时，实验结果表明先进的推理分割模型对对抗性改写仍然脆弱。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了先进的推理分割模型即使在严格的语义和语法约束下也容易受到对抗性改写的影响，表明它们仍然存在脆弱性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate
segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily
focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual
paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same
intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a
novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct
paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading
segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases,
we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human
studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level
optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space
of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves
significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on
both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive
baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.
We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under
strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

Abstract: While new benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are being developed
continuously to catch up with the growing capabilities of new models and AI in
general, using and evaluating LLMs in non-English languages remains a
little-charted landscape. We give a concise overview of recent developments in
LLM benchmarking, and then propose a new taxonomy for the categorization of
benchmarks that is tailored to multilingual or non-English use scenarios. We
further propose a set of best practices and quality standards that could lead
to a more coordinated development of benchmarks for European languages. Among
other recommendations, we advocate for a higher language and culture
sensitivity of evaluation methods.

TL;DR: PerFine是一种无需训练的批判-修正框架，通过迭代的、基于资料的反馈来增强个性化文本生成。在多个数据集上，它表现出色，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化文本生成需要模型不仅产生连贯的文本，还要与目标用户风格、语气和主题焦点对齐。现有的检索增强方法如LaMP和PGraphRAG虽然丰富了用户和邻居历史记录，但它们只停留在生成阶段，经常导致输出偏离语气、主题或风格。

Method: PerFine是一种统一的、无需训练的批判-修正框架，通过迭代的、基于资料的反馈来增强个性化。在每次迭代中，一个LLM生成器根据检索到的资料生成草稿，而一个批评LLM（也基于相同的资料）提供关于语气、词汇、句子结构和主题性的结构化反馈。生成器然后进行修改，同时一种新的淘汰策略在迭代中保留更强的草稿。

Result: 在Yelp、Goodreads和Amazon数据集上，PerFine在个性化方面始终优于PGraphRAG，GEval得分提高了7-13%，在3-5次精炼迭代中持续改进，并且随着批评者规模的增加而具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，事后、基于资料的反馈为个性化大语言模型生成提供了一种强大且无需训练的范式。

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

Conclusion: 本文通过分析RAG、推理增强及其在智能系统中的集成，提出了一个分类法来区分基于知识的和基于逻辑的幻觉，并展示了一个由实际应用、评估和基准支持的统一框架。

Abstract: Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of
large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among
various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely
adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to
balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and
underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been
systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective
of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their
integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy
distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically
examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework
supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

Abstract: Scientific talks are a growing medium for disseminating research, and
automatically identifying relevant literature that grounds or enriches a talk
would be highly valuable for researchers and students alike. We introduce
Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and
unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research
on RPT, we present Talk2Ref, the first large-scale dataset of its kind,
containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where
relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding
source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating
state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and
propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore
strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain
adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly
improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of
the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic
representations from spoken scientific content. The dataset and trained models
are released under an open license to foster future research on integrating
spoken scientific communication into citation recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的词语关联网络方法，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）中的隐性社会偏见，并将其应用于人类和多个广泛使用的LLMs，以研究与性别、宗教、种族、性取向和政党相关的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）日益融入我们的生活，其内在的社会偏见仍然是一个紧迫的问题。检测和评估这些偏见具有挑战性，因为它们通常是隐性的而不是显性的，因此开发评估LLM隐性知识表示的方法至关重要。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于模拟LLM生成的词语关联网络中的语义启动的新颖词语关联网络方法，用于评估LLM中的隐性偏见。我们的基于提示的方法利用了LLM中编码的隐性关系结构，提供了对偏见的定量和定性评估。

Result: 我们的结果揭示了LLM和人类偏见之间的共性和差异，为使用LLMs的潜在风险提供了新的视角。

Conclusion: 我们的方法论为评估和比较多个LLM和人类之间的偏见提供了一个系统、可扩展和通用的框架，推动了透明和负责任的语言技术目标。

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment.

Method: Natural language critiques as a solution for confidence calibration, including Self-Critique and CritiCal.

Result: CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: CritiCal shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution settings, advancing LLM's reliability.

Abstract: Accurate confidence calibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical
for safe use in high-stakes domains, where clear verbalized confidence enhances
user trust. Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions
often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment.
We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for
confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain
and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language
critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique:
uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows
confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended
scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training?
We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their
confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration
training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence
calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that
CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive
baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning
tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution
settings, advancing LLM's reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词汇消歧是自然语言处理中的主要挑战之一，许多系统需要确保正确标记永远不会被丢弃。

Method: 本文介绍了一种适用于零沉默率目标的词汇消歧方法，并在Silberztein的INTEX系统中实现了该方法。

Result: 研究发现，在验证局部消歧语法时，不能单独考虑转换器路径，而需要考虑它们的相互作用。

Conclusion: 为了实现零沉默率的目标，局部语法必须经过仔细测试，并且需要详细说明语法在应用于文本时的行为。

Abstract: Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However,
when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.
Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS
associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.
The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language
processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,
expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.
Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural
language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce
multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct
solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence
rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is
unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a
lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate
and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal
description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation
grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer
paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a
combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by
considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling
of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come
spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often
due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is
targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed
specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be
necessary.

Motivation: 文本幽默种类繁多，计算研究需要考虑这种多样性，包括故意糟糕的幽默。本文旨在通过分析Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest的句子，更好地理解英语中的'坏'幽默。

Method: 本文通过收集和分析Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest的句子，研究了'坏'幽默的特征，并评估了标准幽默检测模型和LLM在生成类似句子方面的表现。

Result: 标准幽默检测模型在本文的语料库上表现不佳，分析发现这些句子结合了常见幽默数据集的特征（如双关语、讽刺）与比喻、元小说和明喻。LLM生成的句子模仿了形式，但过度使用某些文学手法，并包含更多新颖的形容词-名词搭配。

Conclusion: 本文通过分析Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest的句子，发现标准幽默检测模型在处理这些句子时表现不佳，并且这些句子结合了常见的幽默数据集特征和比喻、元小说和明喻等元素。此外，LLM生成的句子虽然模仿了形式，但过度使用某些文学手法，并包含更多新颖的形容词-名词搭配。

Abstract: Textual humor is enormously diverse and computational studies need to account
for this range, including intentionally bad humor. In this paper, we curate and
analyze a novel corpus of sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest to
better understand "bad" humor in English. Standard humor detection models
perform poorly on our corpus, and an analysis of literary devices finds that
these sentences combine features common in existing humor datasets (e.g., puns,
irony) with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs prompted to synthesize
contest-style sentences imitate the form but exaggerate the effect by
over-using certain literary devices, and including far more novel
adjective-noun bigrams than human writers. Data, code and analysis are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可访问的历史语料库，韩语的历史演变在NLP中尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入了Open Korean Historical Corpus，这是一个大规模、开放许可的数据集，涵盖了1300年和6种语言，以及像韩式汉字（Idu）和汉字-韩文混合书写系统这样的未被充分代表的书写系统。

Result: 分析显示：(1) Idu的使用在1860年代达到顶峰后急剧下降；(2) 从汉字到韩文的转变是在1890年左右迅速发生的；(3) 朝鲜的词汇分化导致现代分词器产生高达51倍的未知词率。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一个基础资源，用于定量历时分析，并可以作为大型语言模型的预训练语料库，可能提高它们对现代韩文中的汉字词和古文字系统的理解。

Abstract: The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between
its spoken and written forms and a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the
Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely
unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address
this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly
licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as
under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and
Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5
billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We
leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1)
Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from
Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North
Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times
higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for
quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean
language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language
models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in
modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.

Motivation: 自动语音识别 (ASR) 系统在域外和低资源场景中表现不佳，因为缺乏标记数据。

Method: BEARD 结合了 BEST-RQ 目标和从冻结教师编码器的知识蒸馏，以确保编码器与预训练解码器的互补性。

Result: 在 ATCO2 语料库上的实验表明，BEARD 在使用约 5000 小时未转录语音和 2 小时转录语音的情况下，比之前的基线和微调模型显著提升，相对改进达到 12%。

Conclusion: BEARD 是一种新颖的框架，通过使用未标记数据来适应 Whisper 的编码器，显著提高了在领域适应中的性能。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, despite large multilingual
training, struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled
data is scarce. We propose BEARD (BEST-RQ Encoder Adaptation with Re-training
and Distillation), a novel framework designed to adapt Whisper's encoder using
unlabeled data. Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD
uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen
teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained
decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air
Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native
speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of
untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for
fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline
and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the
fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a
self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.

*Guoxin Chen,Jing Wu,Xinjie Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ruihua Song,Chengxi Li,Kai Fan,Dayiheng Liu,Minpeng Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReForm is a reflective autoformalization method that improves the accuracy of translating natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal statements. It uses semantic consistency evaluation and a novel training approach called PBSO. Experiments show significant improvements over existing methods, and a new benchmark highlights the challenges of autoformalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in preserving the semantic intent of natural language mathematics during autoformalization. Current LLM approaches treat autoformalization as a simplistic translation task, lacking mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement.

Method: ReForm is a Reflective Autoformalization method that integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process, enabling iterative generation, assessment, and refinement of formal statements. Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO) is introduced to train the reflective model effectively by using different rewards at different sequence positions.

Result: ReForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest baselines across four autoformalization benchmarks. ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items, reveals that even human experts make semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

Conclusion: ReForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest baselines in autoformalization tasks. Additionally, the introduction of ConsistencyCheck highlights the inherent difficulty of autoformalization, as even human experts make semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into
machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical
reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large
Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they
often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation
arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic
translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative
refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we
propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates
semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This
enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its
semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive
refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce
Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different
rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both
accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing
superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive
experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm
achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest
baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce
ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only
validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently
difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的dLLMs存在固定的生成长度问题，这导致在解码前必须将生成长度作为超参数确定，从而影响效率和灵活性。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了dLLM-Var。

Method: 我们提出了一种具有原生可变生成长度的扩散LLM，简称dLLM-Var。具体来说，我们旨在训练一个模型来准确预测生成文本中的[EOS]标记，这使得LLM能够以块扩散方式原生推断，同时保持全局双向（完整）注意力和高并行性。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在标准基准测试中实现了比传统扩散LLM推理范式快30.1倍的速度提升，并且相对于自回归模型如Qwen和Llama快2.4倍。我们的方法实现了更高的准确性和更快的推理，使扩散LLM超越了学术新奇性，支持其在实际应用中的使用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial
potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient
generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer
from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs
have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues
in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we
propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths,
abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately
predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to
natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability
of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over
traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to
autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher
accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and
supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models
have been released.

### [64] [Long-Context Modeling with Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention for On-Device LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24606)
*Siheng Xiong,Joe Zou,Faramarz Fekri,Yae Jee Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DHSA is a dynamic, data-driven attention mechanism that improves efficiency and accuracy for long-context LLMs by adaptively segmenting sequences and computing attention sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic cost of attention limits the scalability of long-context LLMs, especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing methods either lack flexibility or prune important contextual tokens, leading to reduced accuracy.

Method: DHSA is a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity online without retraining. It adaptively segments sequences into variable-length chunks, computes chunk representations using length-normalized aggregation, and upsamples chunk-level similarity scores to token level to determine which interactions to preserve.

Result: DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy on tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and LongBench, while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. It also outperforms other baselines like block sparse attention with 6-18% relative gains in accuracy.

Conclusion: DHSA offers an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs, achieving high accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs,
especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods
such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to
reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent
variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has
proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend
on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce
generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their
accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods
for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention
(DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity
online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into
variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the
token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying
chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged
embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the
chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate
importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be
preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and
LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing
prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other
representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves
consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower
cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device
LLMs.

*Snegha A,Sayambhu Sen,Piyush Singh Pasi,Abhishek Singhania,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于前缀的技术在零样本跨语言转移中的效果，并发现它们在低资源多语言设置中表现优于LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数高效的微调（PeFT）技术如LoRA被广泛使用，但基于前缀的技术（如软提示调整、前缀调整和Llama Adapter）在解码器仅模型的零样本转移中较少被探索。

Method: 我们对三种基于前缀的方法进行了全面研究，以实现从英语到35多种高资源和低资源语言的零样本跨语言转移。

Result: 使用Llama 3.1 8B，基于前缀的方法在Belebele基准测试中比LoRA基线高出高达6%。Mistral v0.3 7B也观察到了类似的改进。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了基于前缀的技术作为LoRA的有效且可扩展的替代方案的潜力，特别是在低资源多语言设置中。

Abstract: With the release of new large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral,
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their
multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities. However,
adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains
challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as
soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,
especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a
comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis
further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as
the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix
methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.
Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using
only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent
improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential
of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA,
particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了相对扩展性规律，发现扩展性并不总是能消除性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩展性规律通常在聚合测试集上测量，这可能会掩盖性能差异。因此，引入相对扩展性规律来跟踪性能差距如何随着规模变化而演变。

Method: 使用255个解码器仅Transformer，在匹配的计算（IsoFLOP）预算下从10^18到10^20 FLOPs的标准预训练数据集上进行训练，研究了相对扩展性规律。

Result: 发现不同的轨迹：学术领域在MMLU上趋于一致；区域英语方言根据人口规模变化；AI风险行为集群分裂，能力相关和影响相关的风险在预训练期间增加，而对抗性风险则没有。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展性提高了整体性能，但它并不是一个普遍的平等者。

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data,
parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on
aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over
heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce
relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test
distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error.
Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP)
budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we
find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity;
regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of
AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks
increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results
show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal
equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this
work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling
laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the
bitter lesson.

Method: 本文提出了一种多模态模型，通过整合语言和韵律特征来自动检测荷兰对话中的修复启动。

Result: 结果表明，韵律线索可以补充语言特征，并显著提高预训练文本和音频嵌入的结果，提供了不同特征相互作用的见解。

Conclusion: 未来的研究方向包括引入视觉线索，探索多语言和跨语境语料库以评估模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Maintaining mutual understanding is a key component in human-human
conversation to avoid conversation breakdowns, in which repair, particularly
Other-Initiated Repair (OIR, when one speaker signals trouble and prompts the
other to resolve), plays a vital role. However, Conversational Agents (CAs)
still fail to recognize user repair initiation, leading to breakdowns or
disengagement. This work proposes a multimodal model to automatically detect
repair initiation in Dutch dialogues by integrating linguistic and prosodic
features grounded in Conversation Analysis. The results show that prosodic cues
complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of
pretrained text and audio embeddings, offering insights into how different
features interact. Future directions include incorporating visual cues,
exploring multilingual and cross-context corpora to assess the robustness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: OpenRM is a tool-augmented reward model that improves long-form evaluation by using external tools to gather evidence, leading to better performance in alignment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle with knowledge-intensive and long-form tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's internal knowledge. This limitation hinders their ability to discriminate subtle quality differences when external evidence is necessary.

Method: OpenRM is a tool-augmented long-form reward model that uses external tools to gather relevant evidence. It is trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on synthesized pairwise examples.

Result: Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used benchmarks show that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward modeling approaches. Integrating OpenRM into inference-time response selection and training-time data selection yields consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks.

Conclusion: OpenRM demonstrates significant improvements over existing reward modeling approaches and highlights the potential of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models
(LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and
inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form
tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's
internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating
subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To
address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that
systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather
relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a
controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly
supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing
our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies.
Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used
benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward
modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both
inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields
consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential
of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文研究了阅读障碍者在大规模自然阅读数据集中出现阅读成本的条件和位置，并通过眼动追踪分析了单词长度、频率和可预测性对阅读时间的影响。结果表明，阅读障碍者对这些特征的敏感度更高，尤其是可预测性。通过反事实操纵这些特征，可以缩小阅读障碍者与对照组之间的差距。这些发现支持了阅读障碍理论，即语言工作记忆和语音编码需求增加，并为未来的词汇复杂性和周边预览效益研究提供了动机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们想知道阅读障碍的阅读成本在大规模自然阅读数据集中出现在哪里以及在什么条件下出现。

Method: 使用眼动追踪对齐到单词级特征（单词长度、频率和可预测性），我们建模了每个特征如何影响阅读时间成本。

Result: 所有三个特征都显著改变了典型读者和阅读障碍读者的阅读时间，而阅读障碍读者对每个特征的敏感度更高，尤其是可预测性。这些特征的反事实操纵大大缩小了阅读障碍者与对照组之间的差距，大约三分之一，其中可预测性的影响最大，其次是长度和频率。

Conclusion: 我们量化了额外的阅读障碍成本何时出现、有多大，并为干预措施和阅读障碍者的计算模型提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a
large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to
word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how
each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features
robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that
dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially
predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially
narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing
the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align
with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working
memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical
complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In
short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and
offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for
dyslexics.

TL;DR: R3 是一种基于强化对比学习的 RAG 检索框架，无需依赖标注数据，通过环境互动自动优化相关性，显著提升性能并具有实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着 RAG 的普及，信息检索的目标从为人类用户提供信息转变为为 AI 系统提供上下文知识，但相关性难以预先定义或标注。

Method: R3 通过试错和反馈的强化对比学习优化 RAG 的检索过程，利用检索结果与环境的互动生成对比信号，自动引导检索器自我改进。

Result: R3 在多种任务中提升了 RAG 性能 5.2%，超越了最先进的检索器 4.9%，并且与基于后训练或指令调优 LLM 的 RAG 系统表现相当。

Conclusion: R3 是一种高效的检索框架，能够在 RAG 环境中动态优化相关性，显著提升 RAG 的性能，并且在计算资源上具有实用性。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the
role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for
human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To
address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG
through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,
R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within
the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the
environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the
retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks
demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original
retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving
comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on
post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,
requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的指令调优模型在静态病例摘要上进行训练，而本文的方法通过交互式探索和基于结果的反馈来获取诊断策略。

Method: 本文提出了一种框架，用于训练大型语言模型（LLMs）作为诊断代理，使用强化学习，使其能够管理多轮诊断过程，适应性地选择检查，并做出最终诊断。

Result: DiagAgent在多种诊断设置中表现出色，显著优于10个最先进的LLMs，包括DeepSeek-v3和GPT-4o，以及两个提示工程代理。在单次回合设置中，DiagAgent实现了9.34%的诊断准确率提升和44.03%的检查推荐命中率提升。在端到端设置中，它实现了15.12%的诊断准确率提升和23.09%的检查推荐F1分数提升。在基于评分的评估中，它比第二好的模型Claude-sonnet-4在加权评分上高出7.1%。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，在交互式临床环境中学习策略可以赋予动态且具有临床意义的诊断管理能力，这是通过被动训练无法实现的。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models
(LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to
manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and
commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static
case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive
exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We
present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health
records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and
recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for
realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via
end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that
optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce
DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated
examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written
rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across
diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two
prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34%
higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation
hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic
accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In
rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by
7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies
in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful
diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.

Motivation: 随着翻译模型质量的提高，评估方法需要改进以确保质量提升不会被评估噪声所掩盖。

Method: 实验了当前最先进的翻译评估范式（MQM）的两阶段版本，称为MQM重新标注。

Result: 评分者在重新标注中的行为符合我们的目标，并且重新标注导致了更高品质的注释。

Conclusion: 重新标注结果提高了注释质量，主要是因为发现了第一次通过时遗漏的错误。

Abstract: Human evaluation of machine translation is in an arms race with translation
model quality: as our models get better, our evaluation methods need to be
improved to ensure that quality gains are not lost in evaluation noise. To this
end, we experiment with a two-stage version of the current state-of-the-art
translation evaluation paradigm (MQM), which we call MQM re-annotation. In this
setup, an MQM annotator reviews and edits a set of pre-existing MQM
annotations, that may have come from themselves, another human annotator, or an
automatic MQM annotation system. We demonstrate that rater behavior in
re-annotation aligns with our goals, and that re-annotation results in
higher-quality annotations, mostly due to finding errors that were missed
during the first pass.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索代理缺乏在搜索过程中进行交互的机制，而现有的基准无法评估这种能力。

Method: 通过目标-干扰方法构建了210个专家策划的问题，以创建真实的歧义，这些歧义只能通过交互来解决。

Result: 评估17个模型显示，最佳模型仅达到13.73%的准确率，尽管在完整上下文中达到71.50%，表明系统性过度自信而非推理缺陷。

Conclusion: InteractComp 是一个有价值的资源，可以用于评估和训练搜索代理的交互能力。

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The
code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/InteractComp.

Method: 引入RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA)框架，通过神经元消融和表征分析技术评估角色提示是否引发特定于角色的认知过程。

Result: 角色提示并未显著增强LLMs的医学推理能力，主要影响表面语言特征，没有证据表明不同临床角色存在不同的推理路径或认知差异。

Conclusion: 当前基于角色扮演的医疗AI方法未能复制现实世界中医疗实践的认知复杂性，这突显了角色扮演在医疗AI中的局限性，并强调了需要模拟真实认知过程的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
related code in the following repository:https:

TL;DR: SPICE is a reinforcement learning framework that uses document grounding to enable continuous self-improvement by generating challenging reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ungrounded self-play methods have limited benefits, so there is a need for a framework that allows continuous adaptation through environmental interaction.

Method: SPICE is a reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts as both a Challenger and a Reasoner. The Challenger mines documents to generate reasoning tasks, while the Reasoner solves them. Adversarial dynamics create an automatic curriculum, and corpus grounding provides external signals for improvement.

Result: SPICE achieves consistent gains across mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks on multiple model families, with improvements of +8.9% and +9.8%, respectively.

Conclusion: SPICE enables sustained self-improvement by continuously generating challenging goals through document grounding.

Abstract: Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous
adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a
reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a
Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse
reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics,
the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the
Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich,
near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike
existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE
achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning
(+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how
document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its
own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained
self-improvement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为E-GRPO的新框架，通过利用训练过程中丢弃的实体信息，形成密集的实体感知奖励函数，从而有效提升搜索代理在复杂任务中的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative 'near-miss' samples from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals.

Method: We introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these 'near-misses'.

Result: Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic
data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training
methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity
information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical
limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss"
samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final
answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We
address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our
empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of
ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final
answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a
dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect
samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to
effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse

consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also

Method: 我们引入了一种受最近教育理论的最近进展启发的数据合成方法，即最近的教育理论中的“最近发展区”(ZPD)。我们提出了AgentFrontier Engine，这是一个自动化的数据生成管道，能够生成高质量、多学科的数据，正好位于LLM的ZPD内。

Result: 我们使用合成数据训练了AgentFrontier-30B-A3B模型，在像Humanity's Last Exam这样的具有挑战性的基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，甚至超越了一些领先的专有代理。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，基于ZPD的数据合成方法为构建更强大的LLM代理提供了一条可扩展且有效的方法。

Abstract: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their
capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data
synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve
alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the
AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality,
multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine
supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted
post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive
the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent
capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on
our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding
benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary
agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis
offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出WebLeaper框架，通过构建高覆盖率的IS任务和生成高效的解决方案轨迹，提高IS代理的搜索效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前IS代理存在搜索效率低的问题，这限制了整体性能。目标实体在训练任务中的稀疏性是导致这种低效的关键因素。

Method: 我们将IS建模为树状结构的推理问题，并提出了三种合成IS任务的变体：Basic、Union和Reverse-Union，同时通过保留准确且高效的训练轨迹来优化模型。

Result: 在五个IS基准测试（BrowserComp、GAIA、xbench-DeepSearch、WideSearch和Seal-0）上进行的广泛实验表明，我们的方法在有效性和效率方面均优于强基线。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在五个IS基准测试中 consistently 实现了有效性和效率的提升。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative
approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a
core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While
prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe
that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn
constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is
the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities
for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these
challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS
tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a
tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of
target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated
Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic,
Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and
efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that
are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized
for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both
basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp,
GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over
strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ParallelMuse的两阶段范式，旨在解决传统并行思维在信息寻求代理中的效率低下和长期推理轨迹整合困难的问题。通过功能指定的部分回放和压缩推理聚合，显著提高了性能并减少了资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行思维在此设置中面临两个关键挑战：从头开始重复滚动的低效性，以及在答案生成过程中难以整合长期推理轨迹，因为有限的上下文容量无法充分考虑推理过程。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段范式，称为ParallelMuse，用于深度信息寻求（IS）代理。第一阶段是功能指定的部分回放，将生成的序列划分为功能区域，并进行不确定性引导的路径重用和分支以提高探索效率。第二阶段是压缩推理聚合，利用推理冗余来无损压缩与答案推导相关的信息，并合成一个连贯的最终答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，ParallelMuse在多个开源代理和基准测试中实现了高达62%的性能提升，并减少了10-30%的探索性标记消耗。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ParallelMuse在多个开源代理和基准测试中实现了高达62%的性能提升，并减少了10-30%的探索性标记消耗。

Abstract: Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep
exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance
problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two
key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from
scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories
during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full
consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose
ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first
stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences
into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and
branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed
Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress
information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final
answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks
demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in
exploratory token consumption.

TL;DR: AgentFold是一种新型的代理范式，通过主动上下文管理提高了长期任务的效果，其性能优于许多大规模开源和专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于ReAct的代理在长期任务中面临上下文饱和的问题，而固定总结整个历史的方法可能会导致关键细节的不可逆丢失。因此，需要一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: AgentFold是一种基于主动上下文管理的新代理范式，受到人类认知过程中回顾性整合的启发。它通过执行'折叠'操作，在多个尺度上管理历史轨迹，可以进行细粒度压缩以保留关键细节，或进行深度整合以抽象多步子任务。

Result: AgentFold-30B-A3B代理在BrowseComp和BrowseComp-ZH基准测试中分别获得了36.2%和47.3%的性能，表现出色。

Conclusion: AgentFold-30B-A3B代理在BrowseComp和BrowseComp-ZH基准测试中表现出色，不仅超越了大规模开源模型，还超过了领先的专有代理如OpenAI的o4-mini。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their
effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in
context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context
saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly
summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical
details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm
centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive
process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a
dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log
to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which
manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular
condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations
to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent
benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual
pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp
and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or
matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like
OpenAI's o4-mini.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ADP，一种用于统一不同格式代理数据集的轻量级表示语言，并展示了其在多个基准测试中的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的公共研究结果较少，因为收集代理训练数据存在独特挑战。数据来源并不缺乏，但数据分散在异构格式、工具和接口中。

Method: 引入了agent data protocol (ADP)，一种轻量级表示语言，作为不同格式的代理数据集之间的“通用语”，并将其转换为多个代理框架的训练就绪格式。

Result: 将13个现有的代理训练数据集统一为ADP格式，并将其转换为多个代理框架的训练就绪格式。在这些数据上进行了SFT，平均性能提升了约20%。

Conclusion: ADP可以降低标准化、可扩展和可重复的代理训练的门槛，且在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents
remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents
unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of
underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across
heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the
agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves
as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent
training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to
capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,
software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to
parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,
we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP
format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for
multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an
average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers
state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool
use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data
are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to
standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.

Result: 顶级模型如Gemini-1.5-Pro表现出强大的任务分解能力，但在程序推理和空间理解方面仍落后于人类。性能在不同游戏中差异显著，少量示例能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 虽然顶级模型如Gemini-1.5-Pro展示了强大的任务分解能力，但它们在程序推理和空间理解方面仍不如人类。性能在不同游戏中差异显著，表明对交互复杂性的敏感性。少量示例能显著提升性能，表明LLMs的VR操作能力有改进潜力。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic
actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted
displays (HMDs). While humans intuitively perform this translation based on
common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper
introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate
semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios
from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,
and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against
annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while
top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition
capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial
understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across
games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples
substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted
enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities. We release all materials at

Result: MetricX-25在MQM和ESA质量评分预测上表现出色，显著优于其前身。GemSpanEval在错误跨度检测任务中与xCOMET相当，并能提供更清晰的错误跨度信息。

Conclusion: 本文展示了MetricX-25和GemSpanEval模型在WMT25翻译评估任务中的表现，表明它们在质量评分预测和错误跨度检测方面具有优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submissions to the unified WMT25 Translation
Evaluation Shared Task. For the Quality Score Prediction subtask, we create a
new generation of MetricX with improvements in the input format and the
training protocol, while for the Error Span Detection subtask we develop a new
model, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities
and categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual
open-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We
demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture
with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM
and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our
decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in
error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging
baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we
instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span,
thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在七个推理基准测试中提高了最先进的LVLMs的效果、泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have

TL;DR: 本文介绍了三个资源以推进可视化编码代理：一个大规模的监督数据集、一个系统评估基准以及一个在该数据集上训练的多语言可视化模型家族，实验表明该模型在性能上超越了开源基线并接近专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在实际工作流中常常失败，因为语言覆盖范围有限、执行不可靠以及缺乏迭代修正机制。进展受到狭窄的数据集和基准的限制，这些基准强调单轮生成和单语言任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of
generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing
models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage,
unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has
been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round
generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents.
VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K
validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction
dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for
systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and
protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we
present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on
VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms
strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary
models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching
82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in code agents have enabled automated software development at
the project level, supported by large language models (LLMs) and widely adopted
tools. However, existing benchmarks for code agent evaluation face two major
limitations: high annotation cost and expertise requirements, and rigid
evaluation metrics that rely primarily on unit tests. To address these
challenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that
leverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging
project-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel
benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with
structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive
evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data
sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an
Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of
various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench
demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents
and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation

### [90] [emg2speech: synthesizing speech from electromyography using self-supervised speech models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23969)
*Harshavardhana T. Gowda,Lee M. Miller*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经肌肉语音接口的方法，通过自监督语音特征与肌电信号的线性映射，实现了端到端的EMG到语音生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音接口通常依赖于显式的发音模型和声码器训练，而本文旨在开发一种无需这些组件的更直接的解决方案。

Method: 通过线性映射将自监督语音（SS）特征与肌电图（EMG）功率相关联，并利用不同发音动作对应的EMG功率向量在特征空间中形成的结构化和可分离的聚类，实现EMG到语音的直接转换。

Result: 实验表明，SS特征与EMG功率之间存在强线性关系，相关系数为r = 0.85。此外，不同发音动作对应的EMG功率向量在特征空间中形成结构化和可分离的聚类。

Conclusion: SS模型隐式地编码了发音机制，这使得可以直接将EMG信号映射到SS特征空间并合成语音，从而实现端到端的EMG到语音生成，而无需显式的发音模型和声码器训练。

Abstract: We present a neuromuscular speech interface that translates electromyographic
(EMG) signals collected from orofacial muscles during speech articulation
directly into audio. We show that self-supervised speech (SS) representations
exhibit a strong linear relationship with the electrical power of muscle action
potentials: SS features can be linearly mapped to EMG power with a correlation
of $r = 0.85$. Moreover, EMG power vectors corresponding to different
articulatory gestures form structured and separable clusters in feature space.
This relationship: $\text{SS features}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{linear mapping}}$
$\text{EMG power}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{gesture-specific clustering}}$
$\text{articulatory movements}$, highlights that SS models implicitly encode
articulatory mechanisms. Leveraging this property, we directly map EMG signals
to SS feature space and synthesize speech, enabling end-to-end EMG-to-speech
generation without explicit articulatory models and vocoder training.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了STAR-Bench，用于衡量音频4D智能，揭示了现有模型在感知和推理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频基准测试主要测试可以从文本描述中恢复的语义，掩盖了细粒度感知推理的缺陷。

Method: STAR-Bench结合了基础声学感知设置和全面的时空推理设置，通过两种方法确保高质量样本。

Result: 评估19个模型显示与人类相比存在显著差距，封闭源代码模型受细粒度感知限制，而开放源代码模型在感知、知识和推理方面均落后。

Conclusion: STAR-Bench提供了对物理世界更深入理解的未来模型的重要见解和明确路径。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large
Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that
can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained
perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as
reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to
measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six
attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete
processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source
relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two
methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use
procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we
follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection
based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only
answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops
(-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically
hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared
with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked
by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception,
knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear
path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of
the physical world.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces RoboOmni, a framework for robotic manipulation that infers user intentions from cross-modal contextual instructions, achieving better performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for robotic manipulation rely on explicit instructions, but real-world interactions require robots to infer user intentions proactively.

Method: Introduce cross-modal contextual instructions and present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.

Conclusion: RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid
progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation.
Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on
explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue
instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user
intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual
instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue,
environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address
this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor
framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention
recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses
auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition,
while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training
data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build
OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640
backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation
and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based
baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and
proactive assistance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role
of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing
coherent and instruction-aligned videos. However, strategies for optimizing
video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a
comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V
models.We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective,
decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all
benchmark tools and code at https://github.com/qyr0403/VC4VG to support further
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPER is a self-bootstrapping framework that improves fine-grained visual perception in Vision-Language Models through a two-stage task and reinforcement learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.

Method: ViPER is a self-bootstrapping framework that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine progressive process, integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy.

Result: Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the Qwen-Viper series, which shows an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception.

Conclusion: ViPER provides concrete evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BERT-ViT-EF的新模型，通过早期融合策略结合基于Transformer的编码器BERT和ViT。此外，还提出了扩展模型DTCN，它在BERT之后添加了一个额外的Transformer编码器层以细化文本上下文，并采用对比学习对齐文本和图像表示。实验证明了该方法的有效性，在TumEmo数据集上取得了最佳准确率（78.4%）和F1分数（78.3%），在MVSA-Single数据集上也表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images, offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches.

Method: BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input through an early fusion strategy. DTCN incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text and image representations.

Result: Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy (78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score.

Conclusion: DTCN achieves best accuracy (78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，用于同时进行预测和知识扩展，提高了预测准确性和医学理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前的研究结合了医学知识以提高预测准确性，但它们忽略了通过预测过程同时扩展这种知识的机会。

Method: 开发了一个闭环大型语言模型（LLM）-知识图谱框架，该框架在迭代学习循环中整合预测和知识扩展。

Result: 使用大规模UGC，该框架提高了预测准确性和医学理解。专家评估确认发现了与现有文献互补的临床有意义的症状、共病和社会触发因素。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了计算模型和领域知识的共同进化，为适应性、数据驱动的知识系统提供了基础，适用于其他动态风险监测情境。

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

Motivation: 现有的方法主要集中在预测或趋势描述上，而没有揭示驱动数值变化的潜在事件或解释其背后的推理过程。

Method: 我们提出了一个推理感知框架，该框架集成了一个代理引导的事件提取器（AGE）、一个基于标记多变量霍克斯的合成生成器（EveDTS）以及一个结合时间序列编码器和结构化解码器的两阶段微调管道。

Result: 在多领域数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法在事件级精度和召回率方面显著优于强大的LLM基线。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明了一个新的方向，即弥合定量推理和语义理解之间的差距，使LLMs能够直接从数值动态中解释和预测事件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型通过有效利用与延误来源相关的上下文信息，能够持续实现亚分钟级的预测误差。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了语言理解与轨迹信息跨模态适应相结合在延迟预测中的有效性，并表明该方法在实际操作中具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Conclusion: 本文介绍了MUStReason，这是一个用于诊断视频语言模型在讽刺检测方面局限性的基准测试，并提出了PragCoT框架，以帮助视频语言模型关注隐含意图而非字面意义，这是检测讽刺的核心属性。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

*Zhichao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT is a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning LLMs that minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models, leading to improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning LLMs by minimizing the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models.

Method: GIFT combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA.

Result: GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error (MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable formulation.

Conclusion: GIFT achieves superior reasoning and alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Abstract: We introduce GraphNet, a dataset of 2.7K real-world deep learning
computational graphs with rich metadata, spanning six major task categories
across multiple deep learning frameworks. To evaluate tensor compiler
performance on these samples, we propose the benchmark metric Speedup Score
S(t), which jointly considers runtime speedup and execution correctness under
tunable tolerance levels, offering a reliable measure of general optimization
capability. Furthermore, we extend S(t) to the Error-aware Speedup Score ES(t),
which incorporates error information and helps compiler developers identify key
performance bottlenecks. In this report, we benchmark the default tensor
compilers, CINN for PaddlePaddle and TorchInductor for PyTorch, on computer
vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) samples to demonstrate the
practicality of GraphNet. The full construction pipeline with graph extraction
and compiler evaluation tools is available at

Motivation: 上下文偏差通过在解码过程中整合外部知识（如用户特定的短语或实体）来改善自动语音识别（ASR）。

Method: 我们使用基于注意力的偏置解码器，根据ASR编码器提取的声学信息为候选短语生成分数，这些分数可用于过滤掉不太可能的短语并计算浅层融合偏置的奖励。我们引入了一个逐标记的判别目标，鼓励对真实短语给予更高的分数，同时抑制干扰项。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法有效地过滤掉了大部分候选短语，并在使用分数进行浅层融合偏置时显著提高了不同偏置条件下的识别准确率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法是模块化的，可以与任何ASR系统一起使用，并且过滤机制可以潜在地提高其他偏置方法的性能。

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) by integrating
external knowledge, such as user-specific phrases or entities, during decoding.
In this work, we use an attention-based biasing decoder to produce scores for
candidate phrases based on acoustic information extracted by an ASR encoder,
which can be used to filter out unlikely phrases and to calculate bonus for
shallow-fusion biasing. We introduce a per-token discriminative objective that
encourages higher scores for ground-truth phrases while suppressing
distractors. Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our
method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and
significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions
when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing. Our approach is modular and
can be used with any ASR system, and the filtering mechanism can potentially
boost performance of other biasing methods.
