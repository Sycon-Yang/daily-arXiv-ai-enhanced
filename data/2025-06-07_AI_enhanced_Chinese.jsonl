Existing approaches\noften focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the\ncomplex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of\npatient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway\nmodeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a\nstructured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,\nEHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we\nintroduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into\ntopic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,\nwhile being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance\nin both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming\ncompetitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,\ninherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,\nlab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and\npersonalized healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new method called EHR2Path transforms EHR data into a structured format and predicts future health trajectories.", "motivation": "Existing methods overlook complex interactions in patient health data.", "method": "Transforms EHR data into a structured representation and uses a novel summary mechanism.", "result": "EHR2Path performs well in predicting future health trajectories and simulating patient paths.", "conclusion": "This work opens possibilities for predictive and personalized healthcare."}}
