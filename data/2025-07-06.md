### [1] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对中文语言和文化的多任务偏见评估基准McBE，用于评估大型语言模型中的偏见，并发现所有测试的LLMs都表现出不同程度的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏见评估数据集主要集中在英语和北美文化上，不适用于其他文化，且通常只支持单个评估任务，无法从多个方面评估LLMs中的偏见。因此，需要一个针对中文语言和文化的多任务偏见评估基准。

Method: 本文提出了一种多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），包括4,077个偏见评估实例，覆盖12个单一偏见类别、82个子类别，并引入5个评估任务，以提供广泛类别覆盖、内容多样性和测量全面性。

Result: 本文构建的McBE涵盖了广泛的偏见类别和子类别，并通过评估多个流行的LLMs，发现它们都表现出不同程度的偏见。此外，还对结果进行了深入分析，提供了关于LLMs中偏见的新见解。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个全面的多任务中文偏见评估基准McBE，用于评估大型语言模型中的偏见，并发现所有测试的LLMs都表现出不同程度的偏见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对最先进的推理LLM和非推理LLM在对话摘要任务中的表现进行了全面评估，发现显式的分步推理并不总是有益的，反而可能带来问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话摘要是一项具有重要实际价值的挑战性任务，但在需要同时抽象和简洁的对话场景中，步骤推理架构（如Long Chain-of-Thought）的性能仍未被探索。

Method: 我们对最先进的推理LLM和非推理LLM进行了全面和系统的评估，涵盖了三种主要范式：通用、角色导向和查询导向的对话摘要。

Result: 我们的研究发现，显式的分步推理并不总能提高对话摘要的质量，反而可能导致冗长、事实不一致和不够简洁的摘要。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了对当前推理LLM局限性的新见解，并强调了针对现实世界对话摘要的目标建模和评估策略的必要性。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

### [3] [Latent Chain-of-Thought? Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02199)
*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了Huginn-3.5B模型在算术任务中的内部行为，发现其潜在的CoT推理有限，且递归深度增加带来的收益有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了捕捉难以用语言表示的推理，许多工作探索了旨在将推理内化的递归架构，可能支持潜在的CoT。

Method: 使用了一系列探测技术，包括Logit Lens和Coda Lens，来检查Huginn-3.5B模型在算术任务中的内部行为。

Result: 研究发现，通过跟踪最终和中间结果标记的排名轨迹，有限的证据表明可解释的潜在CoT存在。此外，还发现了递归块之间的显著探测不一致。

Conclusion: 研究发现，增加循环深度带来的收益有限，远不及那些显式外部化推理步骤的模型。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

### [4] [GDC Cohort Copilot: An AI Copilot for Curating Cohorts from the Genomic Data Commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02221)
*Steven Song,Anirudh Subramanyam,Zhenyu Zhang,Aarti Venkat,Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot 是一个开源工具，可以根据用户的自然语言描述自动生成 GDC 队列过滤器，并通过本地部署的大型语言模型实现更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDC 用户（尤其是新用户）可能难以在数百个可能的字段和属性中找到特定的队列描述符，但用户可能更擅长用自然语言描述他们所需的队列。

Method: 开发并评估了多个大型语言模型 (LLMs) 用于 GDC Cohort Copilot，并展示了本地服务的开源 GDC Cohort LLM 在生成 GDC 队列方面优于 GPT-4o 提示的效果。

Result: GDC Cohort Copilot 可以自动根据用户输入的自然语言描述生成 GDC 队列过滤器，并通过交互式用户界面让用户进一步优化生成的队列。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot 是一个用于从 GDC 中策划队列的开源助手工具，它能够根据用户输入的自然语言描述自动生成 GDC 队列过滤器，并在本地部署的大型语言模型 (LLM) 上实现优于 GPT-4o 提示的效果。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

### [5] [MemAgent: Reshaping Long-Context LLM with Multi-Conv RL-based Memory Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02259)
*Hongli Yu,Tinghong Chen,Jiangtao Feng,Jiangjie Chen,Weinan Dai,Qiying Yu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Jingjing Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Hao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出MemAgent，一种用于长文本处理的新代理工作流，能够有效处理无限长文档并在多个测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有了长度外推、高效注意力和记忆模块的改进，但处理无限长文档并保持线性复杂度且不降低性能仍然是长期文本处理中的终极挑战。

Method: 引入了一种新的代理工作流MemAgent，通过分段读取文本并使用覆盖策略更新内存，并扩展了DAPO算法以实现独立上下文多对话生成的训练。

Result: MemAgent展示了卓越的长上下文能力，能够从8K上下文训练的32K文本外推到3.5M QA任务，性能损失小于5%，并在512K RULER测试中达到95%以上。

Conclusion: MemAgent在长文本处理中表现出色，能够在3.5M QA任务中保持性能损失小于5%，并在512K RULER测试中达到95%以上的准确率。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

### [6] [DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02302)
*Dohoon Kim,Donghun Kang,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DoMIX方法，通过LoRA模块解决持续DAP方法的局限性，实现高效、并行的领域自适应预训练，并能提供针对特定任务的定制化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续DAP方法存在计算成本高、对增量数据顺序敏感以及提供单一通用模型的问题，这与DAP的本质相矛盾。因此，需要一种更高效、鲁棒且能提供定制化模型的方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的方法DoMIX，该方法利用LoRA模块（一种参数高效的微调方法）来解决现有持续DAP方法中的问题。

Result: 本文提出的DoMIX方法在领域自适应预训练中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，并能有效利用积累的知识提供针对特定任务的定制化预训练模型。此外，该方法还可扩展到标准LLM微调场景。

Conclusion: 本文提出了DoMIX方法，通过利用LoRA模块解决了现有持续DAP方法的局限性，实现了高效、并行的领域自适应预训练，并能提供针对特定任务的定制化预训练模型。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

### [8] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer that replaces FFN modules with PQC-based layers, demonstrating improved performance and parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dominant parameter contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks.

Method: Introducing QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by PQC-based layers. The design focuses on the FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth, expressibility, and trainability.

Result: A carefully configured QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific parameters by over 99%. The model exhibits a consistent and competitive edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data efficiency.

Conclusion: PQCs can serve as powerful and parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with foundational deep learning principles.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用参数模型进行代码数据选择的方法，以提高训练效率和模型性能。实验结果表明，该方法在减少计算成本的同时有效提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法主要通过利用大量数据来提高模型性能，关注数据数量而常常忽视数据质量，从而降低了训练效率。

Method: 我们引入了一种利用参数模型进行代码数据选择的方法，以提高训练效率和模型性能。我们的方法优化了参数模型，以确保所选子集内的分布一致性和多样性，从而保证高质量的数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅使用10K样本，我们的方法在HumanEval上比92K全采样基线提高了2.4%，在MBPP上提高了2.3%，在性能和效率方面都优于其他采样方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法有效提升了模型性能，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

### [10] [Benchmarking Akan ASR Models Across Domain-Specific Datasets: A Comparative Evaluation of Performance, Scalability, and Adaptability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02407)
*Mark Atta Mensah,Isaac Wiafe,Akon Ekpezu,Justice Kwame Appati,Jamal-Deen Abdulai,Akosua Nyarkoa Wiafe-Akenten,Frank Ernest Yeboah,Gifty Odame*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于Transformer架构的Akan ASR模型在不同语音语料库中的表现，揭示了领域依赖性和不同架构的错误行为，并强调了针对低资源语言的领域适应技术和多语言训练框架的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有的自动语音识别（ASR）研究使用域内数据集来评估模型，但很少评估它们在多样化语音环境中的泛化能力。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本研究通过使用四个Akan语音语料库对七个基于Transformer架构的Akan ASR模型（如Whisper和Wav2Vec2）进行基准测试，以确定它们的性能。

Result: 比较词错误率和字符错误率显示了领域依赖性，模型在其训练领域内表现最佳，而在不匹配场景中显示出显著的准确性下降。此外，还发现了Whisper和Wav2Vec2架构之间的不同错误行为。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了针对特定领域适应技术、自适应路由策略和多语言训练框架的必要性，这对于Akan和其他低资源语言（LRL）来说至关重要。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

widely spoken indigenous language in Ghana. The study involved participants
from diverse backgrounds with speech impairments. The resulting dataset, along
with the cookbook and open-source tools, are publicly available to enable

TL;DR: 本文提出WebSailor，一种后训练方法，旨在赋予模型在复杂信息环境中减少极端不确定性的能力，从而缩小与专有代理的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越人类认知限制是LLM训练的关键前沿。专有代理系统如DeepResearch在极复杂的信息检索基准测试中表现出超人类能力，而开源模型缺乏这种能力。

Method: 通过结构化采样和信息混淆生成新颖的高不确定性任务，RFT冷启动，以及高效的代理强化学习训练算法DUPO，构建了集成管道。

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息检索任务中显著优于所有开源代理，表现与专有代理相当。

Conclusion: WebSailor显著优于所有开源代理，在复杂的信息检索任务中表现与专有代理相当，缩小了能力差距。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在主动学习中考虑人类标签变化的重要性，并提出了一个概念框架，以更好地反映现实标注的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度标注数据的获取仍然是应用监督学习的限制因素。尽管标签变化在自然语言处理中很常见，但标注框架通常仍基于单一真实标签的假设，这忽略了人类标签变化作为一个信息信号的重要性。主动学习虽然是一种优化有限标注预算的方法，但通常依赖于一些简化假设，在承认人类标签变化时很少成立。因此，需要重新审视关于真实性和标签性质的基本假设。

Method: 本文调查了主动学习和人类标签变化社区如何处理或忽视这些区别，并提出了一个概念框架，将人类标签变化融入主动学习循环中，包括实例选择、标注者选择和标签表示。此外，还讨论了将大型语言模型作为标注者的整合。

Result: 本文提出了一个概念框架，用于在主动学习循环中包含人类标签变化，并讨论了大型语言模型作为标注者的整合。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为考虑人类标签变化的主动学习建立概念基础，更好地反映现实标注的复杂性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPF is a novel posttraining alignment framework for LLMs that mitigates bias by leveraging multiperspective generations and decomposing baselines into interpretable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for easy bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs).

Method: MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines by decomposing baseline into interpretable perspective components and guiding generation through sampling and balancing of responses.

Result: MPF aligns LLM sentiment distributions with both counterfactual baselines and the HR baseline, resulting in small KL divergence, reduction of calibration error, and generalization to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过元音模仿实验测量了人类元音生产的'刚刚可产生差异'(JPD)，结果表明JPD在F1 X F2空间中为14到51米之间，这对理解元音系统的结构和心理物理学解释有重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在确定人类元音生产中控制机制的准确性，特别是两个元音刺激在听觉空间中需要多远才能产生可靠的不同模仿。

Method: 研究使用了元音模仿范式来测量两个英语说话者在前元音生产中的'刚刚可产生差异'(JPD)。

Result: JPD被估计在F1 X F2空间中为14到51米之间。

Conclusion: 该研究发现，人类元音系统的可能结构受到心理物理学解释的限制，这为理解元音音位的数量和模式提供了理论基础。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [19] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的自我纠正盲点现象，并提出了通过引入Self-Correction Bench框架来测量这一现象的方法。研究发现，LLMs在纠正自身输出中的错误时存在系统性盲点，这可能与训练数据组成有关。此外，简单的“Wait”提示可以显著减少盲点，表明LLMs具备自我纠正的能力，但需要激活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）已经变得具有变革性，但它们仍然会犯错，并且可能会探索无成效的推理路径。自我纠正对于一个值得信赖的LLM，特别是自回归LLM来说是一个重要的能力。然而，LLMs在识别用户输入中的错误方面表现出色，但在纠正自身输出中的相同错误时却存在系统性的“自我纠正盲点”。

Method: 我们引入了Self-Correction Bench，这是一个系统框架，通过在三个复杂度级别上进行受控错误注入来衡量这一现象。

Result: 测试14个模型，我们发现平均盲点率为64.5%。我们发现多个证据表明，这种限制与训练数据组成有关：人类训练演示主要展示无错误的响应，而不是错误纠正序列，而不同于通过结果反馈学习错误纠正的RL训练模型。值得注意的是，仅仅添加“Wait”可以将盲点减少89.3%，这表明该能力存在，但需要激活。

Conclusion: 我们的工作突显了当前LLM中的一个关键限制，并提供了提高其可靠性和可信度的潜在途径。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了推理语言模型（RLMs）在面对社会偏见时的鲁棒性，发现具有显式推理的模型可能更容易受到偏见影响，挑战了推理能提高鲁棒性的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理语言模型（RLMs）在执行复杂多步骤推理任务方面表现出色，但它们对社会偏见的鲁棒性仍然不清楚。

Method: 我们利用CLEAR-Bias基准测试来研究RLMs对偏见引出的对抗鲁棒性，使用LLM-as-a-judge方法进行自动化安全评分，并利用越狱技术评估内置安全机制的强度。

Result: 研究发现，具有显式推理的模型（无论是通过CoT提示还是微调推理轨迹）通常比没有此类机制的基础模型更容易受到偏见引出的影响，这表明推理可能会无意中为刻板印象强化开辟新途径。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了推理本质上能提高鲁棒性的假设，并强调了需要更注重偏见的推理设计方法。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在数学推理中往往依赖于一对一的图像-文本对和单一解法监督，忽视了有效推理视角和内部反思的多样性。

Method: 我们提出了Qwen-VL-DP，该模型基于Qwen-VL，通过监督学习进行微调，并通过组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行增强，这是一种结合正确性辨别和多样性感知奖励函数的规则强化学习方法。

Result: 在MathVista的minitest和Math-V基准测试中，Qwen-VL-DP显著优于之前的基线多模态大语言模型，在准确性和生成多样性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在准确性和生成多样性方面显著优于之前的基线多模态大语言模型，突显了在多模态数学推理中融入多样视角和反思性推理的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的动态路由框架SynapseRoute，用于将输入查询分配到适当的模式，以提高准确性并减少成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在实际应用中的广泛采用，选择合适的模型需要平衡性能和运营成本。推理能力模型的出现进一步扩大了“思考”（高推理）和“非思考”（快速、低成本）模式之间的成本差距。

Method: 本文提出了SynapseRoute，这是一种基于机器学习的动态路由框架，用于将输入查询分配到适当的模式。

Result: 实验结果表明，SynapseRoute不仅提高了整体准确性（0.8390 vs. 0.8272），还减少了推理时间（36.8%）和令牌消耗（39.66%）。此外，定性分析表明，对简单查询进行过度推理会导致不必要的延迟甚至准确性下降，而我们的自适应路由避免了这一问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的动态路由框架SynapseRoute，可以将输入查询智能分配到思考模式或非思考模式。实验结果表明，与仅使用思考模式相比，SynapseRoute不仅提高了整体准确性，还减少了推理时间和令牌消耗。此外，本文还引入了AIT指数来全面评估准确率、延迟和令牌成本之间的权衡。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Motivation: 当前最强的模型在遵循输出约束方面存在困难，因此需要一个新的基准来评估和改进这一能力。

Method: 本文设计了约束验证模块，并使用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）方法来改进精确指令遵循的泛化能力。

Result: 通过IFBench基准测试，证明了RLVR方法能够显著提高模型在遵循输出约束方面的表现。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个新基准IFBench，用于评估精确指令遵循的泛化能力，并展示了通过RLVR方法可以显著提高指令遵循能力。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了语言模型在使用用户反馈训练时的一个新漏洞，攻击者可以通过简单的点赞或踩赞反馈来持久地改变模型的知识和行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示语言模型在使用用户反馈进行训练时可能存在的安全漏洞，并探索如何利用这些漏洞对模型进行操控。

Method: 攻击者通过提示语言模型随机输出“中毒”或正常响应，并通过点赞或踩赞反馈来影响模型的行为。这种攻击方法利用了后续偏好调优行为中的反馈信号，使得模型在没有恶意提示的情况下也更可能生成中毒响应。

Result: 实验表明，该攻击可以插入模型之前不存在的事实知识、修改代码生成模式以引入可利用的安全漏洞，以及注入虚假的财经新闻。

Conclusion: 本文发现了一种新的语言模型漏洞，表明即使在高度限制的偏好数据情况下，也可以对模型行为进行细粒度控制，并提出了一个利用用户反馈训练的语言模型的新攻击机制。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 的上下文大小限制了其处理大量标记的能力，因此需要一种模块化思考策略来突破这一限制。

Method: MOTIF 通过参数高效的微调，在 GSM8K 数据集上对 Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct 模型进行训练，并在 MATH500 和 AIME2024 基准测试中评估其准确性。

Result: MOTIF 在 MATH500 和 AIME2024 基准测试中分别实现了 3.8% 和 3.3% 的性能提升，并且仅使用了 15% 的样本，展示了其样本效率。

Conclusion: MOTIF 是一种有效的强化学习训练方法，能够在多轮中生成思考标记，从而扩展模型的上下文大小。实验结果表明，MOTIF 在样本效率和性能方面都优于传统的 GRPO 方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项选择题评估存在局限性，因为它们可能不需要看到问题就能回答。因此，需要一种更有效的评估方法。

Method: 本文通过使用答案匹配的方法进行生成式评估，即让候选模型在没有选项的情况下回答问题，并使用现代语言模型与参考答案确定响应是否匹配。

Result: 使用最近的模型进行答案匹配可以达到接近完美的协议，其范围与标注者之间的协议相当。相比之下，多项选择题评估和使用LLM作为法官而不使用参考答案与人类评分的对齐度较差。

Conclusion: 本文讨论了如何从多项选择题评估转向答案匹配评估，以提高语言模型评估的有效性。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

### [27] [Dissecting the Impact of Mobile DVFS Governors on LLM Inference Performance and Energy Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02135)
*Zongpu Zhang,Pranab Dash,Y. Charlie Hu,Qiang Xu,Jian Li,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: This paper addresses the energy-efficiency issue of large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices. It measures the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM framework and identifies the inefficiency caused by the independent operation of mobile governors. Based on these insights, it designs FUSE, a unified energy-aware governor that improves the energy efficiency of LLM inference on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. Current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU, and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate independently and are oblivious of each other.

Method: We conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency in LLM inference, and design FUSE - a unified energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on mobile devices.

Result: The triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths. FUSE reduces the time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM models.

Conclusion: FUSE reduces the time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA is a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes limitations of static toolsets by using a multi-agent architecture with an evolving Template Library and dynamic Tool Ocean. It demonstrates superior performance on biomedical benchmarks and improves with experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets, limiting their ability to adapt and scale.

Method: STELLA employs a multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools.

Result: STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring approximately 26% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, and 63% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6 percentage points. Its performance systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials.

Conclusion: STELLA represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical

### [29] [Strategic Intelligence in Large Language Models: Evidence from evolutionary Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02618)
*Kenneth Payne,Baptiste Alloui-Cros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在迭代囚徒困境中的表现，发现它们具有高度的竞争性，并展示了它们在不同环境下的不同战略行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否是一种新的战略智能形式，能够在竞争环境中推理目标。

Method: 本文进行了首次进化迭代囚徒困境（IPD）比赛，将经典的策略（如以牙还牙、严厉惩罚）与来自领先AI公司的代理进行比较，并通过变化终止概率引入复杂性和偶然性。

Result: LLMs表现出高度的竞争性，在这些复杂的生态系统中持续生存，有时甚至繁衍。Google的Gemini模型表现出战略上的冷酷，利用合作对手并报复背叛者；OpenAI的模型保持高度合作，这在敌对环境中证明是灾难性的；Anthropic的Claude则表现出最宽容的互惠行为，显示出恢复合作的显著意愿。

Conclusion: 本文将经典博弈论与机器心理学联系起来，提供了算法在不确定性下的决策制定的丰富而细致的视角。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了HiRA，一种将战略规划与专业化执行分离的分层框架，能够有效处理复杂信息需求，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）管道难以有效处理现实世界搜索场景中的复杂信息需求，当前基于推理的方法由于使用单一模型处理高层规划和详细执行，导致推理效率低下且可扩展性有限。

Method: 提出了一种分层框架HiRA，将战略规划与专业化执行分离，将复杂的搜索任务分解为聚焦的子任务，并通过结构化集成机制协调结果。

Result: 在四个复杂的跨模态深度搜索基准测试中，HiRA显著优于最先进的RAG和基于代理的系统，结果显示了答案质量和系统效率的提升。

Conclusion: HiRA显著优于最先进的RAG和基于代理的系统，展示了解耦规划和执行在多步骤信息检索任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

### [31] [StepHint: Multi-level Stepwise Hints Enhance Reinforcement Learning to Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02841)
*Kaiyi Zhang,Ang Lv,Jinpeng Li,Yongbo Wang,Feng Wang,Haoyuan Hu,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了StepHint，一种新颖的RLVR算法，利用多级逐步提示来帮助模型更有效地探索解决方案空间。StepHint在六个数学基准测试中表现优于竞争性方法，并展示了更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法面临两个重大挑战：近似奖励问题，其中一个小错误可以使一个原本正确的推理过程无效，极大地阻碍了训练效率；以及探索停滞，其中模型倾向于专注于其“舒适区”内的解决方案，缺乏探索潜在更有效替代方案的动力。

Method: StepHint利用多级逐步提示来帮助模型更有效地探索解决方案空间。它从更强的模型生成有效的推理链，并使用我们提出的自适应分割方法将这些链分割为推理步骤。初始几步作为提示，同时提供多级提示（每个包含不同数量的步骤）给模型。

Result: StepHint通过提供提示减轻了近似奖励问题，从而提高了训练效率。此外，外部推理路径帮助模型发展更好的推理能力，使其能够超越其“舒适区”并缓解探索停滞。

Conclusion: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于竞争性的RLVR增强方法，同时表现出更好的泛化能力，并在域外基准测试中超越基线。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于思维链推理的事件流场景文本识别框架（ESTR-CoT），通过视觉编码器和大语言模型的结合，实现了更有效的识别和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工作要么采用端到端编码器-解码器框架，要么采用大语言模型来增强识别，然而它们仍然受到解释不足和弱上下文逻辑推理的限制。

Method: 我们提出了一个基于思维链推理的事件流场景文本识别框架，称为ESTR-CoT。首先采用视觉编码器EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14)将输入事件流转换为标记，并利用Llama分词器对给定的生成提示进行编码。使用Q-former将视觉标记与预训练的大语言模型Vicuna-7B对齐，并同时输出答案和思维链（CoT）推理过程。我们的框架可以通过监督微调以端到端的方式进行优化。此外，我们还提出一个大规模的CoT数据集，通过三阶段处理（即生成、润色和专家验证）来训练我们的框架。

Result: 我们的框架可以优化使用监督微调以端到端的方式。此外，我们还提出一个大规模的CoT数据集，通过三阶段处理（即生成、润色和专家验证）来训练我们的框架。这个数据集为后续基于推理的大模型的发展提供了坚实的数据基础。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在三个事件流STR基准数据集上进行了广泛的实验，充分验证了所提出框架的有效性和可解释性。源代码和预训练模型将发布在https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT上。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SciGA-145k数据集，用于支持GA选择和推荐以及自动化GA生成的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphical Abstracts (GAs)在科学传播中起着重要作用，但其潜力尚未被充分探索。设计有效的GAs需要高级的可视化技能，这限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 引入了SciGA-145k数据集，定义了两个任务：1) Intra-GA推荐，2) Inter-GA推荐，并提出了CAR作为新的推荐度量标准。

Result: 提供了这两个任务的基线模型，并通过CAR度量标准改进了推荐效果。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k为推进视觉科学传播和人工智能在科学中的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态叙事理解的自动视频编辑框架HIVE，通过角色提取、对话分析和叙事总结来实现对视频内容的整体理解，并将编辑过程分解为三个子任务。为了促进这一领域的研究，我们引入了一个名为DramaAD的新基准数据集。实验结果表明，我们的框架在通用和广告导向的编辑任务中表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容的快速增长，尤其是在短视频平台上，已经产生了对高效视频编辑技术的需求，这些技术可以将长格式视频压缩成简洁且吸引人的剪辑。现有的自动编辑方法主要依赖于ASR转录文本线索和端到端片段选择，往往忽视了丰富的视觉上下文，导致输出不连贯。

Method: 我们提出了一个受人类启发的自动视频编辑框架（HIVE），该框架利用多模态叙事理解来解决这些限制。我们的方法通过多模态大型语言模型进行角色提取、对话分析和叙事总结，从而实现对视频内容的整体理解。为了进一步提高连贯性，我们应用了场景级分割，并将编辑过程分解为三个子任务：亮点检测、开头/结尾选择以及无关内容的修剪。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的框架在通用和广告导向的编辑任务中始终优于现有的基线，显著缩小了自动编辑视频与人工编辑视频之间的质量差距。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的框架在通用和广告导向的编辑任务中始终优于现有的基线，显著缩小了自动编辑视频与人工编辑视频之间的质量差距。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VisCo的视觉中心越狱攻击方法，通过生成上下文对话和辅助图像来构建真实的越狱场景，并结合毒性模糊和语义优化提高攻击效果，在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法中，视觉模态主要作为触发不安全行为的触发器，但存在语义模糊和缺乏现实场景支撑的问题。因此，需要一种新的设置来更好地利用视觉信息进行越狱攻击。

Method: VisCo通过四种不同的视觉聚焦策略生成上下文对话，并在必要时动态生成辅助图像以构建视觉中心的越狱场景。此外，它还结合了自动毒性模糊和语义优化来提高攻击效果。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上实现了4.78的毒性得分和85%的攻击成功率，远超基线（2.48的毒性得分和22.2%的攻击成功率）。

Conclusion: VisCo攻击在MM-SafetyBench上对GPT-4o表现出显著优于基线的效果，证明了其在构建视觉中心的越狱场景中的有效性。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Motivation: 由于语音身份建模的复杂性，现有的ASV嵌入主要关注静态特征，而忽略了动态元素，因此需要一种新的度量标准来评估语音身份的一致性。

Method: 本文研究了ASV嵌入在语音表示中的作用，并提出了U3D度量标准来评估动态节奏模式。

Result: 本文发现ASV嵌入主要关注静态特征，如音色和音高范围，而忽略了动态元素如节奏。同时，提出了U3D度量标准来解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 本文贡献了评估说话人身份一致性的挑战，并提出了U3D度量标准来评估语音的动态节奏模式。

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

Result: ASDA模型在音频分类（AS-2M上49.0% mAP，AS20K上41.5% mAP）、关键词识别（SPC-2上98.3%准确率）和环境声音分类（ESC-50上96.1%准确率）等多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ASDA模型在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，这表明其在音频任务中的有效性，并为更广泛的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting

Conclusion: 我们的方法在13个美国州数据泄露通知法上进行了评估，结果显示生成的表示通过了大约89.4%的测试用例，并实现了82.2的精确率和88.7的召回率。

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

### [41] [Seeing Through Green: Text-Based Classification and the Firm's Returns from Green Patents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287)
*Lapo Santarlasci,Armando Rungi,Antonio Zinilli*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文通过自然语言处理识别真正的绿色专利，并发现它们对公司财务表现有积极影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在通过自然语言处理识别真正的绿色专利，并探讨其对公司的财务表现的影响。

Method: 我们从之前文献中被分类为绿色的约1240万项专利开始训练，训练一个简单的神经网络，通过与环境技术相关的表达的向量表示来扩展基线字典。

Result: 我们发现真正的绿色专利约占之前文献中分类为绿色的专利的20%。真正的绿色专利在技术类别上表现出异质性，并且被后续发明引用的次数少约1%。拥有至少一项真正的绿色专利可以提高销售额、市场份额和生产率，而高新颖性的真正绿色专利还能带来更高的利润。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了使用文本分析来评估更细粒度的专利分类的重要性，这对于不同领域的政策制定是有用的。

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

TL;DR: 本文评估了前沿大型语言模型的隐写术能力，发现它们在特定条件下能够编码消息和进行编码推理，但目前不足以绕过设计良好的监控系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控大型语言模型的输出对于减轻滥用和不对齐的风险至关重要。然而，大型语言模型可能通过隐写术逃避监控，因此需要评估其隐写术能力以更好地了解潜在风险。

Method: 评估前沿大型语言模型的隐写术能力，重点关注两种类型的隐写术：编码消息和执行编码推理。

Result: 当前模型在标准条件下无法在输出中编码短消息而不被监控器发现。然而，如果提供额外的条件，如使用未受监控的草稿板并协调编码方案，则可以成功。此外，模型在简单的状态跟踪问题中显示出早期迹象，能够进行基本的编码推理。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型表现出初步的隐写术能力，尽管这些能力目前可能不足以绕过设计良好的监控系统，但未来可能会发生变化。

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

Motivation: 解决推荐系统中的不公平问题，特别是在动态和交互式对话推荐系统中，因为不公平现象会随着时间的推移而加剧，导致诸如马太效应、过滤气泡和回声室等问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架，即Hypergraph Contrastive Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS)，通过建立多样化的超图并利用对比学习来捕捉广泛的用户兴趣，并在对话中生成信息性响应以确保公平的项目预测。

Result: HyFairCRS在两个基于CRS的数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，同时有效缓解了不公平现象。

Conclusion: HyFairCRS在两个基于CRS的数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，同时有效缓解了不公平现象。

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量关于虚假信息检测的研究，但主要集中在基于文本或图像的方法上，而较少研究探索多模态特征组合。因此，本研究旨在探讨不同多模态特征组合的有效性。

Method: 本研究采用早期融合方法，结合文本、图像和社会特征构建分类模型。通过对象检测和光学字符识别（OCR）等技术提取额外的社会特征和视觉特征，并对1,529条包含文本和图像的推文进行分析。

Result: 研究结果表明，结合无监督和有监督机器学习模型的多模态方法在分类性能上优于单模态和双模态方法。此外，研究还揭示了虚假信息的传播模式，基于虚假信息推文的特点和用户行为进行分析。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，结合无监督和有监督机器学习模型可以显著提高分类性能，相较于单模态模型提升了15%，相较于双模态模型提升了5%。此外，研究还分析了虚假信息的传播模式，基于虚假信息推文的特点和发布者特征进行探讨。

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

TL;DR: 研究比较了多种大型语言模型（LLMs）与专有的领域特定招聘模型（Match Score）在招聘中的表现，发现Match Score在准确性和公平性方面均优于通用LLM，并强调了在高风险领域使用AI时领域特定建模和偏差审计的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在招聘中的应用，以确定其在准确性和算法偏见方面的潜在问题，并探索如何通过领域特定模型来提高公平性。

Method: 研究比较了几种最先进的基础LLM（包括来自OpenAI、Anthropic、Google、Meta和Deepseek的模型）与专有的领域特定招聘模型（Match Score）在职位候选人匹配中的表现。评估了每个模型的预测准确性（ROC AUC、Precision-Recall AUC、F1-score）和公平性（截止分析的影响力比率，跨声明性别、种族和交叉子群体）。

Result: 实验结果显示，Match Score在准确性（ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77）方面优于通用LLM，并在人口统计群体中实现了更公平的结果。Match Score在种族层面的最小影响比率为0.957（接近平等），而最佳LLM的最低影响比率为0.809或更低。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在高风险领域如招聘中使用AI时，领域特定建模和偏差审计的重要性，并警告不要在没有充分公平保障的情况下依赖现成的LLM。此外，实证证据表明，在招聘中选择准确性和公平性之间不应存在二分法，设计良好的算法可以同时实现招聘的准确性与结果的公平性。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), which enable models to think like humans by verifying compatibility between inputs and predictions and using this verification to optimize predictions. EBTs show superior performance and scalability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize System 2 Thinking approaches and develop models that learn to think solely from unsupervised learning.

Method: Training Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) to assign an energy value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence.

Result: EBTs scale faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters, FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2 Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward passes. Further, EBTs achieve better results than existing models on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance.

Conclusion: EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking capabilities of models.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniDraft is a framework that allows a single draft model to work with any target model, addressing compatibility and latency issues, and achieving significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenges of using a target model incompatible with the draft model and improving latency in online deployment settings. It motivates the 'one drafter for all' paradigm.

Method: OmniDraft introduces an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address cross-vocabulary mismatch and leverages adaptive drafting techniques to improve decoding speed.

Result: OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models, including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B, and Llama3-8B, for speculative decoding and provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Conclusion: OmniDraft is a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. It addresses the challenges of cross-vocabulary mismatch and latency improvements, making it suitable for on-device LLM applications.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

TL;DR: ExPO is a framework that generates effective positive samples for reinforcement learning post-training by conditioning on the ground-truth answer, leading to improved learning efficiency and performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock reasoning ability in settings where the model initially struggles, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current output distribution. However, existing methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce positive samples.

Method: Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO) - a simple and modular framework that generates effective positive samples by conditioning on the ground-truth answer.

Result: Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5.

Conclusion: ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

TL;DR: 我们介绍了DeSTA2.5-Audio，这是一个通用的大型音频语言模型（LALM），旨在实现稳健的听觉感知和指令遵循，而无需任务特定的音频指令微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LALMs通常通过在大规模手动整理或LLM合成的音频指令数据集上进行训练来增强大型语言模型（LLM）的听觉能力，但这些方法往往导致LLM原始语言能力的灾难性遗忘。

Method: 我们重新审视了数据构建流程，并提出了DeSTA，这是一种自生成的跨模态对齐策略，其中骨干LLM生成自己的训练目标。

Result: 使用DeSTA，我们构建了DeSTA-AQA5M，一个包含500万训练样本的大规模、任务无关的数据集，这些样本来自7000小时的音频，涵盖50个不同的数据集，包括语音、环境声音和音乐。DeSTA2.5-Audio在多个音频-语言基准测试中达到了最先进的或有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了在LALM开发中精心设计的数据构建的重要性，并为构建强大且通用的LALM提供了实用见解。

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

Method: FinAI-BERT is a domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related content at the sentence level within financial texts. It was fine-tuned on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669 annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023).

Result: FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993), outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal samples.
