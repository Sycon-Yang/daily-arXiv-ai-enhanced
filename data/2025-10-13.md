### [1] [Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition using GLiNER-BioMed with Targeted Dictionary-Based Post-processing for BioASQ 2025 task 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08588)
*Ritesh Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioASQ数据集上的表现，并引入了一种基于字典的后处理策略来解决常见的误分类问题。虽然在开发集上取得了显著改进，但这种改进并未推广到盲测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) 是从科学文献中提取信息的关键任务，但面临着诸如区分基因和化学物质等类似实体类型等障碍。

Method: 本研究评估了GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioASQ数据集上的表现，并引入了一种针对性的基于字典的后处理策略来解决常见的误分类问题。

Result: 后处理方法在开发集上表现出显著的改进，将微F1分数从基线的0.79提高到0.83，但在盲测集上没有得到推广，后处理模型的微F1分数为0.77，而基线为0.79。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了基于字典的精炼对于预训练BioNER模型的潜力，但也强调了对开发数据过拟合的挑战以及确保实际应用中稳健泛化的必要性。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

### [2] [Less Diverse, Less Safe: The Indirect But Pervasive Risk of Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08592)
*Shahriar Kabir Nahin,Hadi Askari,Muhao Chen,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文揭示了TTS在候选多样性受限时可能产生不安全输出的新失败模式，并提出了一种诊断攻击方法RefDiv来测试TTS管道的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-Time Scaling (TTS)通过探索多个候选响应并在此集合上操作以找到最佳输出来提高LLM推理。然而，当候选多样性受到限制时，TTS更容易产生不安全的输出。

Method: 本文提出了一个参考引导的多样性降低协议（RefDiv），用作诊断攻击来压力测试TTS管道。

Result: 在四个开源模型和两种常用的TTS策略中，限制多样性显著增加了TTS产生不安全结果的比率。此外，现有的安全防护措施无法检测由RefDiv生成的对抗性输入提示。

Conclusion: 本文希望激发未来研究，设计出既有效又安全的TTS策略，以应对由RefDiv所展示的针对多样性的压力测试。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

### [3] [Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593)
*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAREN-CTC is a novel architecture for speech-based depression detection that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech-based depression detection remains limited by the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse, heterogeneous depressive cues over time.

Method: HAREN-CTC is a novel architecture that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss.

Result: HAREN-CTC achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on MODMA.

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores on DAIC-WOZ and MODMA, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

### [4] [Systematic Diagnosis of Brittle Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08595)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架来衡量数学推理，通过分析模型在不同推理模式下的表现，揭示了其在组合推理方面的脆弱性，并为未来的发展提供了路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在多大程度上理解数学这一核心问题，超越标准基准来诊断特定的失败点。

Method: 我们首先从gpt-3.5-turbo生成结构化的逐步推理，然后使用更强大的分析模型gpt-4o-mini对错误进行分类，并执行无监督聚类以识别出现的“推理模式”。

Result: 分析揭示了一个具有明显非人类特点的脆弱性：虽然模型在顺序计算等程序性模式上达到接近完美的准确性，但在需要组合推理的模式上的表现却急剧下降。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了一种更细粒度的方法来评估数学理解，并为开发新的能力和更可靠的应用程序提供了精确的路线图。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

### [5] [Confidence, Not Perplexity: A Better Metric for the Creative Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08596)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出信心分数（CS）作为传统指标的替代方法，以减少创造性文本生成中的偏差，并证明其在评估不同难度任务上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标如自困惑度在创造性文本生成中存在明显偏差，需要一种更少偏差的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于模型输出概率分布的信心分数（CS），作为传统指标的替代方法。

Result: 实验表明，在99个创意提示中，基于流利度的指标在0%的情况下偏好新响应，而CS在19%的情况下这样做，差异具有统计学意义。此外，CS能够有效区分简单、中等和困难任务。

Conclusion: 信心分数减轻了传统指标的创造性偏差，同时保留了它们的核心评估优势，为现代大型语言模型提供了更平衡的评估。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

### [6] [Recover-LoRA: Data-Free Accuracy Recovery of Degraded Language Models via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08600)
*Devleena Das,Rajeev Patwari,Ashish Sirasao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量且与数据集无关的方法Recover-LoRA，用于恢复因推理优化而导致性能下降的语言模型的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究主要集中在鲁棒的量化技术上，而本文关注于从任何导致模型权重退化的来源中恢复模型准确率，例如不正确的模型序列化。

Method: Recover-LoRA 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏来学习选择性层的LoRA适配器，以将退化的模型与全精度模型对齐。

Result: Recover-LoRA 在MHA和GQA小型语言模型上恢复了5-17%的模型准确率。

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA 可以恢复模型准确率，提高在不同小型语言模型上的性能。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

### [7] [Mnemosyne: An Unsupervised, Human-Inspired Long-Term Memory Architecture for Edge-Based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08601)
*Aneesh Jonelagadda,Christina Hahn,Haoze Zheng,Salvatore Penachio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne is an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. It uses graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay and refresh processes modeled after human memory. In experiments, it showed superior performance in longitudinal healthcare dialogues, achieving high win rates and benchmark scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained devices. There is a need for an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term memory architecture that is suitable for edge-based LLMs and can handle longitudinal conversations effectively.

Method: Mnemosyne is an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term memory architecture for edge-based LLMs. It uses graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay and refresh processes modeled after human memory. It also introduces a concentrated 'core summary' derived from a fixed-length subset of the memory graph to capture user personality and domain-specific details.

Result: In experiments with longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrated the highest win rate of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. It also achieved the highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval compared to other same-backboned techniques. The average overall score of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and OpenAI baselines among others.

Conclusion: Mnemosyne demonstrates that improved factual recall, enhanced temporal reasoning, and more natural user-facing responses can be feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory architecture.

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

### [8] [Human Texts Are Outliers: Detecting LLM-generated Texts via Out-of-distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08602)
*Cong Zeng,Shengkun Tang,Yuanzhou Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Wenchao Yu,Xujiang Zhao,Haifeng Chen,Wei Cheng,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文将AI生成文本检测任务重新定义为分布外检测问题，采用单类学习和基于能量的方法，实现了更高的检测性能和更广的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将检测任务视为二分类问题，导致跨领域和模型的泛化能力不足。人类文本不构成统一分布，无法通过有限采样有效捕捉，导致分类器记忆观察到的OOD特征而非学习非ID行为的本质。

Method: 本文提出将检测任务重新定义为分布外（OOD）检测问题，采用单类学习方法（如DeepSVDD和HRN）以及基于能量的方法进行检测。

Result: OOD-based方法在DeepFake数据集上达到了98.3%的AUROC和AUPR，以及8.9%的FPR95。此外，在多语言、受攻击和未见过的模型及领域文本设置中验证了框架的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出将检测任务重新定义为分布外（OOD）检测问题，通过使用单类学习方法和基于能量的方法，实现了鲁棒且可推广的性能。实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上表现优异，并在多语言、受攻击和未见过的模型及领域文本设置中展示了框架的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

*Deshui Yu,Yizhi Wang,Saihui Jin,Taojie Zhu,Fanyi Zeng,Wen Qian,Zirui Huang,Jingli Ouyang,Jiameng Li,Zhen Song,Tian Guan,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个病理学向量数据库，并提出了YpathRAG框架，通过双通道混合检索和基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块，显著提高了病理学领域的检索质量和事实可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作通常依赖于领域微调，这既没有扩展知识边界，也没有强制执行基于证据的约束。

Method: 构建了一个覆盖28个子领域和153万段文本的病理学向量数据库，并提出了YpathRAG框架，该框架结合了双通道混合检索（BGE-M3密集检索与基于词汇引导的稀疏检索）以及一个基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块，以闭合检索-判断-生成循环。

Result: 在YpathR上，YpathRAG的Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提高了23个百分点；在YpathQA-M上，一组300个最具挑战性的问题，它平均将通用和医学LLM的准确率提高了9.0%，最高达15.6%。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明了改进的检索质量和事实可靠性，为病理学导向的RAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

*Raffaele Mura,Giorgio Piras,Kamilė Lukošiūtė,Maura Pintor,Amin Karbasi,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LatentBreak的白盒越狱攻击，通过替换输入提示中的词语来生成低困惑度的对抗性提示，从而绕过基于困惑度的过滤器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak attacks that leverage mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based filtering on the input prompt.

Method: LatentBreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests.

Result: LatentBreak generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses.

Conclusion: LatentBreak leads to shorter and low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息在数字平台上的快速传播威胁着公共讨论、情绪稳定性和决策。尽管之前的工作已经探索了各种对抗性攻击，但本文研究的具体转换尚未被系统地研究。

Method: 我们提出了一个具有检索增强生成的多语言、多代理大型语言模型框架，可以作为网络插件部署到在线平台中。

Result: 我们提出了一个可以部署为网络插件的多语言、多代理大型语言模型框架，以应对语言切换、查询长度膨胀和结构重新格式化等攻击。

Conclusion: 我们的工作强调了人工智能驱动的虚假信息检测在保护在线事实完整性方面的重要性，同时展示了基于插件的部署在现实世界网络应用中的可行性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public
discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has
explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific
transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In
particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish,
Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length
inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into
multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual,
multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation
that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work
underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in
safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing
the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

*Yu Liu,Hanlei Shi,Haoxun Li,Yuqing Sun,Yuxuan Ding,Linlin Gong,Leyuan Qu,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于热点的统一模型，用于情绪识别，通过热点门控融合和路由混合对齐器来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情绪识别在对话中很困难，因为区分性证据稀疏、局部化且在不同模态中常常异步。

Method: 我们提出了一个统一的模型，该模型检测文本、音频和视频中的每句话热点，通过热点门控融合（HGF）与全局特征融合，并使用路由混合对齐器（MoA）对齐模态；跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准的ERC基准测试中，实验显示了对强基线的一致提升，消融实验确认了HGF和MoA的贡献。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，以热点为中心的观点可以为未来的多模态学习提供参考，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: 本文提出MMA-ASIA框架，用于评估大型语言模型在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识，包含多模态基准测试和五维评估协议，揭示了模型在不同语言和模态中的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在非西方、资源较少的环境下，其多模态理解和推理能力常常下降，因此需要一种专门评估文化意识的框架。

Method: 本文提出了MMA-ASIA框架，包括一个涵盖8个亚洲国家和10种语言的多模态基准测试，以及一个五维评估协议，还引入了文化意识验证模块和Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR)方法。

Result: MMA-ASIA是第一个在文本、图像和语音三个模态上对齐的数据集，能够直接测试跨模态迁移。通过比较模型分析、注意力追踪和VPR方法，揭示了模型在不同语言和模态中的差异。

Conclusion: 本文提出了MMA-ASIA框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识，并通过多维评估协议和创新方法揭示了模型在不同语言和模态中的差异，为构建文化可靠的多模态LLMs提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource

cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphGhost is a framework that uses graph-based methods to analyze and understand the reasoning mechanisms in Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the structural mechanisms underlying the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: GraphGhost represents neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, enabling the use of graph algorithms like PageRank to characterize LLM properties.

Result: GraphGhost reveals shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors across datasets, and shows that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse.

Conclusion: GraphGhost is a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在医疗保健中的应用可能存在性别相关偏差，需要定期检查LLM的身份分配一致性以确保可靠的AI支持的临床护理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在医疗保健中的应用中可能存在的性别相关偏差，以确保AI支持的临床护理的可靠性和公平性。

Method: 通过将性别（女性、男性或未指定）分配给多个开源和专有LLM，并评估其在LLM性别分配下的响应一致性来研究LLM中的性别相关偏差。

Result: 大多数模型在LLM性别分配下的诊断相对一致，但在患者性别在LLM诊断中的相关性和必要性方面，所有模型都表现出显著的不一致性，特别是在相关性判断方面。一些模型甚至在对患者性别的解释上表现出系统性的女性-男性差异。

Conclusion: 研究发现，LLM在临床实践中的可靠性可能受到身份分配不一致的影响，因此需要定期检查LLM的身份分配一致性以确保可靠的AI支持的临床护理。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

*Kaiqi Yang,Hang Li,Yucheng Chu,Zitao Liu,Mi Tian,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文设计了一个基于大语言模型的框架，用于自动生成数学应用题中的干扰条件，解决了现有数据集的不足，提高了生成带有干扰条件的数学应用题的效率和数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学应用题数据集通常只包含必要信息，而忽略了包含干扰或冗余条件的问题。这导致大语言模型在面对这些干扰条件时性能显著下降。然而，目前可用的带有干扰条件的数据集数量有限，且难度低、表达不连贯，使得干扰条件容易被检测和忽略，降低了基准测试的可信度。此外，添加干扰条件可能会改变推理过程和答案，需要大量手动检查和重写解决方案。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的迭代框架，通过设计一系列提示语从多个角度和认知层次修订数学应用题，生成有意义的干扰条件，并提供进一步优化的建议。框架的关键优势在于保持原始问题和修改后问题的共同解，使得大语言模型生成的干扰条件不会改变原始解，从而无需重新生成答案。

Result: 本文提出的框架能够高效地生成带有干扰条件的数学应用题，同时保持高数据质量。通过保留原始问题和修改后问题的共同解，框架大大减少了生成此类问题所需的努力。

Conclusion: 本文设计了一个迭代框架，利用大语言模型自动生成干扰条件，从而解决现有数据集中干扰条件不足和质量低的问题。该框架能够保留原始问题和修改后问题的共同解，从而避免了重新生成答案的需求，提高了生成带有干扰条件的数学应用题的效率和数据质量。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

### [17] [LLMs Show Surface-Form Brittleness Under Paraphrase Stress Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08616)
*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在重新表述测试项时的表现，发现准确率显著下降，表明基准分数可能被高估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的基准分数可能因记忆测试项或近似重复而被夸大。需要一种方法来探测模型的泛化能力，以确保其性能评估的准确性。

Method: 研究提出了一种简单的协议，通过在重新表述的基准问题上重新评估模型来探测泛化能力。使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct，测量了原始和重新表述项之间的准确率差距。该流程控制解码，强制多选输出格式，并包括一个稳健的重新表述清理步骤以保持语义。

Result: 研究发现，重新表述导致了非微小的准确率下降（原始与重新表述之间），这与之前关于数据污染和脆弱的表面形式快捷方式的担忧一致。

Conclusion: 研究发现，重新表述测试项会导致准确率显著下降，这与之前关于数据污染和脆弱的表面形式快捷方式的担忧一致。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个专注于泰语的大型语言模型，通过扩展策略和系统整合泰语知识，实现了在泰语任务上的优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的泰语模型主要依赖于现有的开源模型，通过额外训练来专门化泰语，但这种方法可能导致模型参数空间中已有的知识被侵蚀。

Method: JAI-1采用了一种扩展策略：从一个较小的高性能英语开源LLM开始，扩大其参数空间，并利用新分配的能力系统地整合泰语知识。

Result: JAI-1在泰语相关基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）中表现出优于Typhoon2-70B的性能。

Conclusion: JAI-1展示了其在泰语相关基准测试中的优越性能，验证了其扩展和知识整合框架的有效性。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

Motivation: 随着代理对话模型的迅速崛起，现实用户模拟器研究对于调整有效的对话策略至关重要。

Method: 研究调查了一个基于用户资料（包括年龄、性别和职业）调整对话的销售导向代理。

Result: 职业对对话意图产生了最显著的差异，通过引入一种轻量级的职业条件策略，使代理能够优先考虑与用户偏好一致的意图，从而实现更短且更成功的对话。

Conclusion: 研究强调了丰富模拟器资料的重要性，并展示了如何通过简单的人物角色指导策略来提高销售导向对话系统的有效性。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Text2Stories，这是一个用于文本到故事对齐的任务和度量标准，可以量化需求与实际需求的匹配程度。实验显示基于LLM的匹配器表现良好，而嵌入模型虽然单独效果不佳，但能有效进行阻塞。这些度量标准可用于比较不同故事集，作为现有用户故事质量标准的补充。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估从自然语言输入中生成的需求是否准确反映利益相关者的需求仍然是一个 largely 手动的任务。

Method: 我们引入了Text2Stories，这是一个任务和度量标准，用于文本到故事的对齐，允许量化需求（以用户故事的形式）与获取会话参与者实际需求的匹配程度。给定一个访谈转录本和一组用户故事，我们的度量标准量化了（i）正确性：由转录本支持的故事比例，以及（ii）完整性：至少有一个故事支持的转录本比例。我们将转录本分成文本块，并将对齐实例化为块和故事之间的匹配问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到了0.86的宏F1分数，而嵌入模型单独使用时表现较差，但能有效进行阻塞。

Conclusion: 我们的实验表明，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到了0.86的宏F1分数，而嵌入模型单独使用时表现较差，但能有效进行阻塞。最后，我们展示了我们的度量标准如何在故事集之间进行比较（例如，人工生成的与自动生成的），将Text2Stories定位为现有用户故事质量标准的可扩展、来源忠实的补充。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

TL;DR: PARSE是一个新的系统，通过优化JSON模式和实现基于反射的提取，显著提高了结构化信息抽取的准确性并减少了错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法将JSON模式视为静态合同，导致抽取性能不佳、频繁幻觉和不可靠的代理行为。

Method: PARSE系统包含两个协同组件：ARCHITECT和SCOPE，分别用于优化JSON模式和实现基于反射的提取。

Result: PARSE在SWDE数据集上实现了64.7%的抽取准确率提升，并在第一次重试中减少了92%的抽取错误。

Conclusion: PARSE系统在多个数据集上表现出色，提高了抽取准确性并减少了错误。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Motivation: 研究评估气味是否在没有相应能力提升的情况下夸大了测量性能。

Method: 使用一个开放权重模型（GPT-OSS-20B），进行了六个配对的A/B场景实验，比较了评估导向和现实世界框架以及推理深度的影响。

Result: 评估框架可靠地增加了链式思维（CoT）长度并减少了仅答案合规性，但准确性提升有限或不一致。激励措辞改变了错误组成，不同语言的评估框架也显示出不同的影响。

Conclusion: 本文提供了可重复的A/B框架和实用建议，以确保基准测试结果反映可部署的能力。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

TL;DR: PULSE is a framework that uses SLM-generated rationales as learning signals to improve recommendation systems, showing better performance and transferability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models (SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness their full potential as learning signals.

Method: PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings) is a framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals, supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions (what) and their semantic drivers (why).

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented question answering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and

Motivation: 现有方法无法提供现实世界审核所需的上下文和解释，因此需要改进。

Method: ExPO-HM 结合了 SFT 热身、带有课程学习的 GRPO 以及作为推理质量度量和奖励的条件决策熵 (CDE)。

Result: ExPO-HM 在三个仇恨梗基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，在二进制检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面分别比 GRPO 和 DPO 基线提高了最多 15% 和 17% 的 F1 分数。

Conclusion: 通过将仇恨梗的检测从简单的二进制警报转变为基于解释的检测，ExPO-HM 提供了准确、可解释和可操作的审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

Motivation: 现有的MDLM模型存在一定的局限性，因此需要一种更灵活且有效的语言建模方法。

Method: HDLM是一种基于分层词汇的离散扩散模型，通过将低层次的详细语义标记映射到高层次的粗粒度语义标记来实现语言建模。在前向过程中，每个标记根据调度器独立地扰动到其更高层次的祖先，而在反向过程中，模型逐步预测更详细的语义。

Result: 实验结果表明，HDLM在文本生成任务中表现优异，能够提供更准确的语言建模效果。

Conclusion: HDLM在文本生成任务中表现出色，相比基线模型具有更低的验证和生成困惑度。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

TL;DR: UCoT是一种高效的推理框架，通过前期思维嵌入来自动化CoT压缩，显著减少推理过程中的计算成本和延迟，同时保持强大的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的CoT压缩工作通过繁琐的离散提示设计或构建外部压缩CoT数据集来提高推理效率，但牺牲了关键的推理细节。因此，需要一种更高效且自动化的CoT压缩方法。

Method: UCoT是一种高效的推理框架，通过前期思维嵌入来自动化CoT压缩。它涉及一个小型模型（压缩器）和一个大型模型（执行器）。第一阶段训练压缩器生成富含推理信息的前期思维嵌入，避免了手动设计提示的缺点。第二阶段优化执行器以利用前期思维嵌入得出正确答案，使用奖励机制。

Result: UCoT在保持执行器强大推理能力的同时显著减少了CoT的长度。当应用于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型时，在GSM8K数据集上令牌使用量减少了50%，性能比最先进的方法高出3.08%。

Conclusion: UCoT能够在保持执行器强大推理能力的同时显著减少CoT的长度，并在GSM8K数据集上将Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的令牌使用量减少了50%，同时性能比最先进的方法高出3.08%。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法，通过整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，分析个人叙述中的语言风格，并展示了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏一个正式的框架来系统分析个人叙述中的风格选择，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文结合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，利用语言模型自动提取语言特征，并分析这些特征与心理状态的关系。

Result: 通过对数百个梦境叙述的分析，特别是对一名战争老兵的案例研究，发现了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系，例如动词过程在心理过程中的主导地位。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个正式的框架，用于系统分析个人叙述中的风格选择，并展示了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项的新框架，以提高心理测量的精度和准确性。在抑郁症案例研究中，该方法显示出显著的改进，并具有在临床健康等领域应用的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的心理评估依赖于结构化的评分量表，无法包含被试自然语言的丰富细微差别。因此，需要一种新的方法来利用自然语言数据，以提高心理测量的精度和准确性。

Method: 本研究利用最近的LLM进展，将定性数据纳入一个新颖的概念框架中，结合LLM评分文本和传统的评分量表项来创建增强的测试。通过计算项目信息来实证选择最有信息量的LLM评分说明。

Result: 在保留测试集中，增强的测试在测量精度和准确性方面取得了统计学上显著的改进。从LLM项目中获得的信息量相当于在原始19个项目测试中增加了6.3（真实数据）到16.0（合成数据）个项目。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项的新概念框架，以增强心理测量措施。该方法在抑郁症案例研究中得到了验证，并显示出显著的测量精度和准确性的提高。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个高效的dLLM推理框架，通过算法创新和系统优化实现了显著的效率提升，同时保持了输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管越来越多的开源dLLM模型出现，但缺乏标准化和高效的推理框架限制了它们的广泛应用。

Method: dInfer将推理流程分解为四个模块化组件，并集成了每个组件的新算法和系统级优化。

Result: dInfer在LLaDA-MoE上实现了显著的效率提升，在HumanEval上每秒超过1100个标记，并在六个基准测试中平均超过800个标记。与之前系统相比，dInfer比Fast-dLLM快10倍，与AR模型QWen2.5-3B相比，仍快2-3倍。

Conclusion: dInfer是一个高效的、可扩展的dLLM推理框架，通过算法创新和系统优化实现了显著的效率提升，同时保持了输出质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at

### [30] [Scaling Laws for Code: A More Data-Hungry Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08702)
*Xianzhen Luo,Wenzhen Zheng,Qingfu Zhu,Rongyi Zhang,Houyi Li,Siming Huang,YuanTao Fan,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies the scaling laws for code large language models and finds that they require a higher data-to-parameter ratio than natural language, and that code-natural language mixtures can be beneficial in some scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scaling laws that guide efficient training of large language models are predominantly analyzed on natural language, but it is unclear if these laws are directly applicable to code due to fundamental differences like strict syntax.

Method: We conducted a large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117 experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from 2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farseer law, and performed additional experiments on code-natural language mixtures.

Result: The Farseer law offers greater accuracy than the Chinchilla law for code LLMs. Code LLMs scale effectively with model size, but require a higher data-to-parameter ratio than natural language. Code-natural language mixtures benefit resource-constrained scenarios but become detrimental at higher compute budgets.

Conclusion: Code LLMs scale effectively with model size, but require a higher data-to-parameter ratio than natural language. Additionally, code-natural language mixtures can benefit resource-constrained scenarios but become detrimental at higher compute budgets.

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，用于分析大型语言模型在法律领域中的推理能力，并揭示了其在复杂推理任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）表现出惊人的能力，但它们在这一复杂、微妙的推理形式中的熟练程度需要进一步研究。

Method: 我们提出了一个正式的框架，将识别案例之间重要区别的过程分解为三个阶段的推理任务。该框架使用称为因素的事实谓词对案例进行建模，将它们组织成法律知识层次结构，并定义了可验证的规则来识别区别、分析其论据支持并评估其重要性。

Result: 通过现代推理LLMs的全面评估，我们发现了一个悖论：尽管模型在表层推理（任务1）上达到高准确率，但在分层推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）上的表现下降，并在综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）中崩溃。最引人注目的是，我们发现模型在错误回答上消耗的计算资源比正确回答更多，这表明“思考更久”并不总是意味着“思考更聪明”。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了一种细粒度分析LLM在复杂领域推理能力的方法，并揭示了必须解决的根本限制，以实现稳健和可信赖的法律AI。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

Motivation: 现有的测试用例评估基准存在高计算成本、分数膨胀和偏向于简单错误而非罕见关键故障的问题，因此需要一种更有效的基准构建方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种将基准构建形式化为二进制代码-测试矩阵中的最优诊断基的问题，并引入了WrongSelect算法来选择最大多样性的错误代码。

Result: 通过应用该框架到数百万个竞赛编程提交中，构建了TC-Bench基准。实验表明，即使最先进的测试用例生成方法在TC-Bench上的排除率也仅为约60%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的框架，用于构建紧凑、多样化且抗通胀的测试用例基准TC-Bench，并展示了当前最先进的测试用例生成方法在TC-Bench上的排除率仅为约60%，表明它们在诊断能力上存在显著差距。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

TL;DR: 微基准测试在模型性能差异较小时可能不可靠，需要更多样本才能保证结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微基准测试可以降低语言模型开发的时间和成本，但其是否能像完整基准测试一样可靠地对模型进行排序仍需验证。

Method: 本文引入了一种元评估度量标准，用于研究微基准测试在不同模型性能差异下的排名能力。

Result: 研究表明，微基准测试在模型性能差异较小时无法保持一致性，需要选择较多的样本才能保证可靠性。

Conclusion: 本文提供了关于微基准测试的实用指导，帮助用户和开发者在评估效率和可靠性之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Conclusion: 我们的方法在任务中提高了性能，并且微调的较小LLM可以达到与更大现成模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Motivation: 随着LLM的使用在全球范围内变得普遍，理解并限制其多语言响应的需求增加。

Method: 研究评估了前沿和领先的开源模型在五种维度上的响应，使用五点评分标准和法官LLM进行评估。

Result: GPT-5在每个类别中平均表现最好，而其他模型在语言和类别之间表现出更多的不一致性。在同意与自主权以及危害预防与安全类别中，GPT得分最高，而Gemini 2.5 Pro得分最低。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要进一步测试语言变化如何影响LLM在不同类别中的响应，并改进这些领域。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories
and improvement in these areas.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应保留机制，可以在不修改基础注意力或任务头的情况下，显著减少计算和内存需求，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力随着序列长度呈二次方增长，限制了长上下文的使用。需要一种方法来减少计算和内存需求，同时保持性能。

Method: 提出了一种概率性的、逐层的标记选择机制，称为自适应保留，通过伯努利门进行训练，并在推理时使用简单的top-M规则进行强制执行。

Result: 仅保留30-50%的标记即可保持>=95%的全模型性能，同时将峰值内存减少约35-45%，并提高吞吐量高达1.8倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在不修改基础注意力或任务头的情况下，提供了实用的长上下文效率。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Motivation: 为了填补大型语言模型在一般中文语境中全面评估的空白，我们提出了Chinese Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR)，一个新颖的基准测试，旨在评估大型语言模型整合中文特定事实知识与多步骤逻辑推理的能力。

Method: 首先从现有的问答数据集中构建一个领域平衡的种子集，然后开发一个基于LLM的管道来生成基于事实单元链的多跳问题。为了确保数据集的质量，我们实施了一个人机结合的验证系统，其中领域专家系统地验证和优化生成的问题。

Conclusion: CCMOR基准测试表明，大型语言模型在处理长尾知识和执行知识密集型推理方面仍然存在持续的局限性。然而，检索增强生成显著缓解了这些知识差距，带来了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学工作流需要算法具有严谨性、与深度领域知识相关联，并包含领域特定的推理，同时还需在不依赖I/O测试用例的情况下进行算法迭代。许多科学问题需要一系列子问题的解决才能得到最终结果，因此需要一种更有效的框架来处理这些挑战。

Method: MOSAIC是一种多智能体大型语言模型（LLM）框架，采用学生-教师范式，使代理能够自我反思、生成推理、编写和调试代码，同时结合了 Consolidated Context Window (CCW) 技术来减少LLM在解决复杂科学任务时的幻觉问题。

Result: MOSAIC在科学编码基准上进行了评估，并证明了其专用的代理框架在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSAIC作为一种无需训练的框架，通过专门设计的代理在学生-教师范式中自我反思、生成推理、编写和调试代码，有效解决了科学代码生成中的挑战，并在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了语言结构如何影响在英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语医学语料库上训练的LLMs中的隐私泄露，并发现语言对隐私泄露有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地被部署在处理敏感数据的多语言应用中，但它们的规模和语言多样性引入了主要的隐私风险。

Method: 我们量化了六个语言指标，并评估了三种攻击向量：提取、反事实记忆和成员推断。

Result: 结果表明，隐私脆弱性随着语言冗余和分词粒度而增加：意大利语表现出最强的泄漏，而英语显示出更高的成员可分离性。相比之下，法语和西班牙语由于更高的形态复杂性而表现出更大的弹性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了第一个定量证据，表明语言在隐私泄露中起着重要作用，强调了在LLM部署中需要语言意识的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

Result: 在六个涵盖Freebase和Wikidata的知识图谱问答基准测试中，SoG实现了最先进的性能，尤其在Wikidata基准测试中比之前的最佳方法提升了16%。

Conclusion: SoG在多个知识图谱问答基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，尤其是在Wikidata基准测试中表现出显著的提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多轮越狱框架PE-CoA，通过分析不同对话模式对大型语言模型的影响，揭示了模型在不同危害类别中的弱点，并强调了需要模式感知的防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮越狱方法通常依赖于启发式或临时的探索策略，无法深入理解模型的弱点。对话模式与模型漏洞之间的关系在不同危害类别中仍未被充分理解。

Method: 我们提出了Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA)，这是一个通过自然对话构建有效多轮越狱的五种对话模式框架。

Result: 我们在十二个大型语言模型上评估了PE-CoA，涵盖了十个危害类别，取得了最先进的性能，揭示了模式特定的漏洞和模型行为特征。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了大型语言模型在不同危害类别中的模式特定漏洞和行为特征，强调了安全训练的局限性，并指出了需要模式感知防御的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

TL;DR: 本文评估了文档级翻译中质量估计重排序的性能，并展示了其在不同翻译模型上的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知在句子级别上有效，但其在日益突出的文档级翻译领域的应用仍缺乏探索。

Method: 评估文档级（而非典型的句子级）翻译中的QE重排序性能，使用各种学习的和基于大语言模型（LLM）的QE度量标准。

Result: 使用最佳学习度量标准SLIDE，在只有两个候选者的情况下，BLEURT-20得分提高了+2.00，在32个候选者的情况下提高了+5.09。使用最佳基于LLM的度量标准GEMBA-DA，在相同条件下分别获得了+1.63和+4.30的增益。即使在更长的输入下增益减少，使用32个候选者在最长文档（512-1024源标记）上也分别实现了+2.34（SLIDE）和+1.40（GEMBA-DA）的改进。

Conclusion: 这些发现展示了文档级质量估计的实用价值，只要具备合适的翻译模型和硬件，运行时开销最小。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了FinAuditing，这是一个用于评估大型语言模型在财务审计任务上的多文档基准，揭示了当前模型在结构化财务文档推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL文件的分层结构使得财务审计的自动化和验证变得更加困难。尽管大型语言模型在非结构化文本理解方面表现出色，但它们在结构化、相互依赖和基于分类法的财务文档上的推理能力仍鲜有研究。

Method: 我们引入了FinAuditing，这是第一个与分类法对齐、结构感知的多文档基准，用于评估大型语言模型在财务审计任务上的表现。我们还提出了一个统一的评估框架，整合了这些子任务中的检索、分类和推理指标。

Result: 对13个最先进的大型语言模型进行的广泛零样本实验表明，当前模型在语义、关系和数学维度上的表现不一致，当在分层多文档结构上进行推理时，准确率下降了60-90%。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了现代大型语言模型在基于分类法的财务推理中的系统性局限，并将FinAuditing确立为开发可信赖、结构感知和监管对齐的财务智能系统的基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在多个推理基准上显著提升了大型语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

TL;DR: SAC is a novel context compression method that directly selects anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates their key-value representations, eliminating the need for autoencoding training. It outperforms existing methods in various compression ratios and shows significant improvements on out-of-distribution evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current context compression methods rely on autoencoding tasks, which create a mismatch between reconstruction optimization and real-world downstream tasks, weakening features beneficial for practical use. SAC aims to address this by directly leveraging anchor tokens for compression.

Method: Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC) shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with compression capability a priori. It selects anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value representations.

Result: SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

Conclusion: SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios, achieving significant improvements on out-of-distribution evaluation.

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

Motivation: 研究LLM内部表示中的人工印象，这些印象类似于人类的印象和刻板印象，并探索它们与模型行为和提示特征的关系。

Method: 通过在生成的提示上拟合线性探测器来预测根据二维刻板印象内容模型（SCM）的印象，并研究印象与下游模型行为以及可能影响这些印象的提示特征之间的关系。

Result: LLM在被提示时不一致地报告印象，但印象可以从隐藏表示中更一致地线性解码。此外，人工印象可以预测模型响应的质量和使用模糊表达的情况。

Conclusion: 人工印象可以预测模型响应的质量和使用模糊表达的情况，并且可以用来研究提示中的特定内容、风格和方言特征如何影响LLM的印象。

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于业务场景涉及复杂的标准操作程序（SOP），而目前对LLM在这些情境下的评估尚未充分探索，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文提出了SOP-Maze基准，从真实业务数据中构建了397个任务，并将SOP任务分为LRS和HRS两类。

Result: 实验表明，几乎所有最先进的模型在SOP-Maze上都表现不佳，并发现了三个关键错误类别：路线盲点、对话脆弱性和计算错误。

Conclusion: 本文通过系统研究LLM在SOP任务中的表现，提供了改进模型能力的新见解，并开源了相关工作。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in RLVR, which rely on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes that prevent adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities.

Method: Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO), which dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the model's learning state.

Result: Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading baselines across six math benchmarks.

Conclusion: DARO outperforms four leading baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster convergence and superior final performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading

Motivation: Current approaches require computationally expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high costs with limited gains.

Method: LoRA-based Refusal-training is used to enhance model safety without degrading general performance by training solely on safety data.

Result: LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

Conclusion: LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when trained solely on safety data, showing that LoRA serves as cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and

Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as

Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为LitE-SQL的轻量级和高效的框架，用于将自然语言问题转换为SQL查询。该框架在两个任务上表现出色，且使用的参数数量远少于基于LLM的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法取得了强大的性能，但它们对专有模型的依赖引发了关于部署可行性和数据隐私的担忧。因此，我们需要一种轻量级且高效的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 我们引入了LitE-SQL，这是一个轻量且高效的框架，包含两个组件：(i) 一个Schema Retriever，它使用预计算的模式嵌入向量数据库进行高效的模式链接；(ii) 一个经过两阶段微调的SQL生成器——监督微调 followed by 执行引导的强化学习，实现了无需昂贵的多候选生成的自我纠正。

Result: 在BIRD上，LitE-SQL达到了72.10%的执行准确率，在Spider 1.0上达到了88.45%，展示了与基于LLM的方法相当或更好的性能，尽管使用的参数数量少2倍到30倍。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，使用轻量级模型可以实现高质量的Text-to-SQL生成，为隐私敏感和资源受限的环境提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 本研究通过迭代优化评分标准，显著提升了基于大型语言模型的自动作文评分效果，甚至在简单初始评分标准下也能达到或超过人工编写的评分标准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能高度依赖于它们接收到的提示，因此我们希望通过优化评分标准来提升自动作文评分的效果。

Method: 我们的方法通过让模型反思自身的评分理由并观察与人类评分的差异，来迭代优化评分标准。

Result: 实验结果显示，在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上，使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct模型，QWK得分分别提高了0.19和0.47。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了在基于大型语言模型的自动作文评分中进行迭代评分标准优化的重要性，以提高与人类评估的一致性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的Bangla转写Chakma语料库，并通过微调多语言模型展示了其在Chakma语言迁移学习中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma作为一种印欧语系语言，可用数据有限，在语言模型中仍被严重忽视。因此，需要开发一种有效的语言模型来支持Chakma语言的研究。

Method: 我们引入了一个新的语料库，该语料库包含从Chakma文学中收集的上下文连贯的Bangla转写Chakma，并由母语者验证。使用这个数据集，我们在掩码语言模型（MLM）任务上微调了六种基于编码器的多语言和区域变压器模型（mBERT、XLM-RoBERTa、DistilBERT、DeBERTaV3、BanglaBERT和IndicBERT）。

Result: 我们的实验表明，微调的多语言模型在适应Bangla转写Chakma时优于其预训练版本，达到了73.54%的标记准确率和低至2.90的困惑度。我们的分析还强调了数据质量对模型性能的影响，并展示了OCR管道在形态丰富的印地语脚本中的局限性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究证明，Bangla-transliterated Chakma可以非常有效地用于Chakma语言的迁移学习，并且我们发布了经过人工验证的单语数据集，以鼓励对低资源语言的多语言语言建模的进一步研究。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how LLMs process factual queries and finds that they don't encode truthfulness in their internal states, only patterns of knowledge recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether internal computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs, given that LLMs can produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or spurious associations.

Method: We conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their reliance on subject information.

Result: When hallucinations are associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable hidden-state geometries. Hallucinations detached from subject knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them detectable.

Conclusion: LLMs do not encode truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall, demonstrating that 'LLMs don't really know what they don't know'.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多语言乌尔都语-英语模型Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct，它使用一种修改后的自我指导技术来生成高质量的多语言合成数据集，以提高对乌尔都语特定任务的理解。该模型在性能上优于现有的多语言LLM，并且在较低的训练预算内取得了显著的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个针对低资源语言如乌尔都语的高性能大型语言模型（LLM）面临诸多挑战，包括高质量数据集的缺乏、多语言不一致性和安全问题。现有的多语言LLM通常通过翻译大量可用数据来解决这些问题，但这种翻译往往质量不高且缺乏文化细微差别，同时还需要大量的数据整理和训练成本。

Method: 我们使用修改后的自我指导技术开发了一个高质量的多语言合成数据集(Urdu-Instruct)，该数据集通过为每个任务使用独特的提示和种子值以及全局任务池，结合了乌尔都语本土的思维链推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct模型在乌尔都语特定任务上的表现优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并且在不到100美元的训练预算内超过了领先的多语言LLM，包括Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，可以使用我们修改后的自我指导方法高效且文化上一致地开发高性能和低资源语言LLM。所有数据集、模型和代码均可在https://github.com/traversaal-ai/alif-urdu-llm上公开获取。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 研究提出了ReFIne框架，以提高推理模型的可信度，包括可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长链思维推理研究主要关注答案准确性和令牌效率，而忽视了对可信度至关重要的方面。

Method: 提出ReFIne训练框架，结合监督微调和GRPO，以提高可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。

Result: ReFIne模型在可解释性、忠实性和可靠性方面均有显著提升，分别提高了44.0%、18.8%和42.4%。

Conclusion: 研究指出，推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应关注更广泛的可信度维度。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

*Chihiro Yano,Kosuke Yamada,Hayato Tsukagoshi,Ryohei Sasano,Koichi Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于因果语言模型（CLMs）的新语义框架诱导方法FrameEOL，利用上下文学习和深度度量学习来获取更合适的框架嵌入，并通过聚类进行框架诱导。实验结果表明，该方法在英语和日语数据集上均优于现有方法，尤其在日语数据集上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管因果语言模型（CLMs）如GPT和Llama系列在广泛的语言理解任务中表现优异，并且可以像理解框架一样进行对话，但它们尚未被应用于语义框架诱导。因此，本文旨在探索CLMs在语义框架诱导中的应用。

Method: 我们提出了基于CLMs的新方法，具体来说，我们引入了FrameEOL，这是一种基于提示的方法，用于获取输出一个表示给定情况的框架名称作为标签的框架嵌入。为了获得更适合框架诱导的嵌入，我们利用了上下文学习（ICL）和深度度量学习（DML）。然后通过聚类结果嵌入进行框架诱导。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上优于现有的框架诱导方法。特别是对于日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法达到了与经过DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上优于现有的框架诱导方法。特别是对于缺乏丰富框架资源的日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法达到了与经过DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

Motivation: 由于LLMs的规模和能力不断进步，传统RAG框架的优势变得不那么明显和必要，因此需要重新审视RAG的作用。

Method: 本文对RAG进行了全面的综述，从其总体目标和核心组件开始，然后分析了RAG中的关键挑战，并展示了LLMs alone表现不足但RAG可以显著提高其效果的应用场景。

Result: 本文展示了RAG在某些应用场景中能够显著提高LLMs的效果。

Conclusion: 本文希望鼓励研究人员重新考虑RAG的作用，并激发下一代RAG系统的开发。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试依赖于表面级指标，无法捕捉这一流派的独特特征。

Method: 我们引入了DITING，这是第一个全面的网络小说翻译评估框架，评估叙事和文化忠实度的六个维度。我们还提出了AgentEval，这是一种推理驱动的多代理评估框架，以及MetricAlign，这是一个元评估数据集。

Result: 对十四种开放、封闭和商业模型的综合评估显示，中国训练的LLM优于更大的外国对手，DeepSeek-V3提供了最忠实和风格一致的翻译。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为探索基于LLM的网络小说翻译建立了一个新范式，并提供了公共资源以推动未来的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过引入TAU来改善LLM对个体人格特征的模拟能力，使其更贴近人类人格特征。

Method: 该研究通过在对话数据中加入思考 aloud 话语（TAU）来增强数据，以建模文本聊天中的个体人格，并使用Big Five框架评估训练后的个性化LLM的人格特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用TAU增强数据训练的LLM在宜人性和神经质方面与说话者的人格特征更加接近。

Conclusion: 研究发现，使用TAU增强数据训练的个性化LLM在拟合说话者的宜人性和神经质方面比使用原始对话数据训练的LLM更接近人类人格特征。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

Motivation: 由于难以衡量文本去标识技术隐藏个人身份的能力，因此需要一种有效的评估方法。本文旨在通过重新识别攻击来评估去标识化方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 本文通过尝试反向过程——重新识别，评估去标识化方法的鲁棒性，并提出了两种策略：一是考虑重新识别顺序的影响，二是利用推理模型提升性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过聚合多个顺序的预测可以提高重新识别效果，同时推理模型在 adversary 拥有大量背景知识时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了两种互补策略来构建更强的重新识别攻击，表明了重新识别顺序的重要性以及推理模型在提升重新识别性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的翻译增强方法，通过仅在平行数据上应用层选择性微调，显著提高了翻译性能，并在多语言任务中表现出色。该方法为多语言增强提供了一个有前景的解决方案，显著降低了复杂性并提高了可访问性。

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

TL;DR: DICE is a lightweight framework that guides small language models to refine large language models' outputs through chain-of-thought correction, improving format accuracy and content correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address the issue of prioritizing reasoning over adherence to detailed instructions is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access.

Method: DICE is a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. It decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. DICE constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern.

Result: DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4% and 29.4%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.

Conclusion: DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4% and 29.4%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Conclusion: IRIS 是一种解决传统统计算法和基于 LLM 的方法在因果发现中局限性的新框架，能够实时从一组初始变量中发现已知和新的因果关系，并通过识别缺失变量来扩展因果图。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CrisiText数据集，这是第一个针对13种不同危机场景的警告信息生成的大规模数据集。通过实验比较了多种自然语言生成方法，并评估了模型在分布外场景中的性能以及自动后编辑器的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI已被用于帮助人类应对紧急情况，但自然语言处理技术的应用仍然有限，主要集中在分类任务上。然而，利用自然语言生成架构及时生成警告信息的潜力尚未被充分挖掘。因此，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 本文从现有的危机描述出发，创建了与场景相关的事件链，并将每个事件与警告信息配对。生成的警告信息遵循专家编写的指南，以确保术语和建议的事实性。此外，每个消息还配有三个次优警告类型，以便研究不同的自然语言生成方法。

Result: 本文提出了CrisiText数据集，包含超过400,000条警告信息，涵盖了近18,000个危机情境。通过实验比较了多种自然语言生成方法，并评估了模型在分布外场景中的性能以及自动后编辑器的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了CrisiText数据集，这是第一个针对13种不同危机场景的警告信息生成的大规模数据集。通过实验比较了监督微调设置与偏好对齐、零样本和少样本方法，并评估了模型在分布外场景中的性能以及自动后编辑器的有效性。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

*Chenyang Gu,Yewen Pu,Bruce Yang,Xiaofan Li,Huan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DSPO的改进强化学习算法，用于通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤进行稳健的代理训练。该方法无需监督演示数据，通过纯粹的强化学习训练模型，使其能够交错多轮搜索和推理。在多个QA基准测试中，DSPO训练的7B模型表现优于之前的工作，并在复杂多跳QA任务中甚至超过了之前工作的14B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法要么依赖于提示来激发模型的内在代理能力，要么在应用强化学习到复杂交互任务时表现出性能瓶颈和崩溃，导致其真正的代理潜力未被开发。

Method: 引入了动态过滤序列级策略优化（DSPO），这是一种改进的强化学习算法，旨在通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤进行稳健的代理训练。

Result: DSPO训练的7B模型在多个QA基准测试中比之前的工作提高了34.1%，并且在复杂的多跳QA任务如HotpotQA中几乎以9%的相对优势超过了之前工作的14B模型。

Conclusion: DSPO训练的7B模型在多个QA基准测试中优于之前的工作，并且在复杂多跳QA任务中甚至超过了之前工作的14B模型，同时保持了出色的训练稳定性。

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

*Yongding Tao,Tian Wang,Yihong Dong,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Xiaolong Hu,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对强化学习后训练阶段的数据污染问题，提出了一种名为Self-Critique的新方法，并引入了RL-MIA基准进行测试。实验结果显示，该方法在多个模型和任务中表现优异，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染对大型语言模型（LLMs）的可靠评估构成重大威胁。虽然已开发出预训练和监督微调阶段的检测方法，但在日益重要的强化学习（RL）后训练阶段缺乏专门的检测方法。随着RL后训练在推动LLM推理中的重要性增加，这一领域存在关键漏洞。因此，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为Self-Critique的方法，该方法基于一个关键观察：在RL阶段之后，大型语言模型的输出熵分布倾向于坍缩为高度特定和稀疏的模式。通过探测策略坍缩，即模型收敛到狭窄的推理路径，从而导致熵减少，实现数据污染检测。此外，还引入了RL-MIA基准，以模拟这种特定的数据污染场景。

Result: 实验结果表明，Self-Critique方法在多个模型和任务中显著优于基线方法，实现了高达30%的AUC提升。而现有方法在RL阶段的数据污染检测上接近随机猜测，本文方法使得检测成为可能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Self-Critique方法，用于检测强化学习（RL）后训练阶段的数据污染问题。实验表明，该方法在多个模型和任务中显著优于基线方法，实现了高达30%的AUC提升。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CFVBench，一个大规模、手动验证的基准测试，用于评估多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在检索和生成阶段的能力。研究发现，现有模型在捕捉细粒度多模态细节方面存在困难，并提出了一种自适应视觉增强（AVR）框架来解决这一问题。实验表明，AVR能有效提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面有限，通常专注于单模态或有限模态任务，或者粗粒度场景理解。为了弥补这些差距，我们引入了CFVBench，一个大规模、手动验证的基准测试，构建于599个公开可用的视频上，产生5,360个开放式的问答对。

Method: 我们提出了自适应视觉增强（AVR），这是一种简单而有效的框架，可以自适应地增加帧采样密度并在必要时选择性地调用外部工具。

Result: 使用CFVBench，我们系统地评估了7种检索方法和14种广泛使用的MLLMs，揭示了一个关键瓶颈：当前模型（即使GPT5或Gemini）难以捕捉短暂但关键的细粒度多模态细节。实验表明，AVR能够持续提升细粒度多模态理解能力，并提高所有评估的MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: 当前模型（即使是最先进的GPT5或Gemini）在捕捉短暂但关键的细粒度多模态细节方面存在困难。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了自适应视觉增强（AVR），这是一种简单而有效的框架，可以自适应地增加帧采样密度并在必要时选择性地调用外部工具。实验表明，AVR能够持续提升细粒度多模态理解能力，并提高所有评估的MLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为DyReMe的动态基准，以更好地反映实际临床实践，评估大型语言模型在准确性和其他三个临床相关的维度上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型（LLMs）的评估与现实世界的临床实践不一致，大多数依赖于来自公共医学考试题的静态基准，这往往会高估模型性能，并忽略了教科书案例与现实世界中模糊、变化的条件之间的差异。

Method: 我们提出了DyReMe，这是一个动态基准，更好地反映了实际临床实践。

Result: 我们的实验表明，这种动态方法产生了更具挑战性和现实的评估，揭示了最先进的LLMs性能与现实临床实践之间的显著不一致。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了需要更符合可信赖医疗诊断需求的评估框架的紧迫性。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

*Jiuheng Lin,Cong Jiang,Zirui Wu,Jiarui Sun,Yansong Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLARity is a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using only a small, general-purpose LLM, improving response consistency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency. Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive.

Method: CLARity integrates a consistency-aware reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to better exploit limited data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and professionalism.

Conclusion: CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的句子嵌入方法存在固有局限，只能为每个句子分配一个向量，这导致难以捕捉句子中的隐性语义。

Method: 提出了一种名为DualCSE的句子嵌入方法，该方法为每个句子分配两个嵌入：一个表示显性语义，另一个表示隐性语义。这些嵌入在共享空间中共存，使得可以选择所需的语义以用于特定目的，如信息检索和文本分类。

Result: 实验结果表明，DualCSE可以有效地编码显性和隐性含义，并提高下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，DualCSE可以有效地编码显性和隐性含义，并提高下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）预训练过程中评估过程的不稳定性问题，并提出了MaP框架来解决参数不稳定性和评估不稳定性。MaP通过检查点合并和Pass@k指标的结合，实现了更平滑的性能曲线、减少运行间的方差并确保更一致的模型排名。

Motivation: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics.

Method: We introduce MaP, a dual-pronged framework that synergistically integrates checkpoint merging and the Pass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance statistical estimate of model capability.

Result: Extensive experiments show that MaP yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance, and ensures more consistent model rankings.

Conclusion: MaP provides a more reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct

\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw

construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

TL;DR: MaskKV是一种针对dLLMs的训练-free 缓存淘汰框架，通过两个创新方法显著提升了其在资源受限环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缓存淘汰策略是为自回归模型（ARMs）设计的，忽略了dLLMs的独特特性，导致性能不佳。因此，需要一种专门针对dLLMs的缓存淘汰框架。

Method: MaskKV通过两个关键创新来实现缓存淘汰：(1) 基于mask-query的评分机制，利用注意力权重识别并淘汰每个头中不重要的提示token；(2) 自适应缓存预算策略，通过减少中间层的分配并将资源集中在偏好提示的头上来提高效率。

Result: 在LLaDA上使用MaskKV，将KV缓存压缩到仅256对（少于5%的token），在LongBench上保留了94%的全缓存性能，并在32k提示长度下实现了高达31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV是一种针对扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的训练-free 缓存淘汰框架，能够有效提升其在资源受限环境下的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于电路的推理验证（CRV）方法，通过分析正确和错误推理步骤的结构特征，实现了对模型推理错误的深入理解和修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的链式思维（CoT）验证方法基于输出（黑盒）或激活（灰盒）预测推理正确性，但对计算失败的原因提供有限的见解。

Method: 我们引入了一种白盒方法：基于电路的推理验证（CRV）。我们假设正确CoT步骤的归因图，作为模型潜在推理电路的执行轨迹，与错误步骤的图具有不同的结构指纹。通过在这些图的结构特征上训练分类器，我们证明这些轨迹包含推理错误的强大信号。

Result: 我们的白盒方法产生了其他方法无法获得的新科学见解。 (1) 我们证明了错误的结构特征具有高度预测性，确立了通过计算图直接验证推理的可行性。 (2) 我们发现这些特征高度领域特定，揭示了不同推理任务中的失败表现为不同的计算模式。 (3) 我们提供了证据表明这些特征不仅仅是相关性的；通过使用我们的分析来指导对单个编解码器特征的有针对性的干预，我们成功地纠正了模型的错误推理。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，通过审查模型的计算过程，我们可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的更深层次的因果理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决统一压缩比导致性能下降以及之前方法在解码过程中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出了一种细粒度低秩压缩器 (FLRC)，它为每层确定最佳的秩分配，并结合渐进式低秩解码以保持文本生成质量。

Result: 在多种基准测试中进行的全面实验表明 FLRC 的优越性，在摘要任务中 ROUGE-L 提高了高达 17%。

Conclusion: FLRC 是一种更稳健和高效的框架，可以提高 LLM 推理性能。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Method: 引入LLP，这是一个基于大型语言模型的生成框架，用于二手产品定价。LLP首先检索类似产品以更好地适应动态市场变化，然后利用大型语言模型对自由文本中的关键定价信息进行细致理解，生成准确的价格建议。应用两阶段优化（监督微调和组相对策略优化）来加强大型语言模型对检索产品的领域推理。此外，LLP采用基于置信度的过滤机制来拒绝不可靠的价格建议。

Result: LLP在广泛的实验中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。在相同的30%产品覆盖率下，它将静态采用率（SAR）从40%提高到72%，即使在90%的召回率下也能保持47%的强SAR。

Conclusion: LLP显著优于现有方法，并在未见过的类别上表现出良好的泛化能力。已在闲鱼成功部署，显著优于之前的定价方法。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReTraceQA基准，用于评估常识推理任务中的推理过程，发现当前的评估方法可能高估了小型语言模型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评估实践主要依赖于最终答案的准确性，而忽略了导致这些答案的推理过程的有效性。

Method: 我们引入了ReTraceQA，这是一个新的基准，用于对常识推理任务进行过程级评估，并使用强大的大型语言模型作为自动评判者来进行推理感知评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，当使用大型语言模型作为自动评判者时，小型语言模型的表现显著下降，得分最多下降了25%。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，当前的评估指标可能高估了小型语言模型的能力，因为它们只关注最终答案而非推理过程。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

Motivation: 研究是否可以在不进行额外训练的情况下激发大型推理模型的长链式思维能力。

Method: 提出了一种解码时间方法ThinkLogit，利用logit算术将目标大型非推理模型调整为长推理模型，使用一个较小的推理模型作为引导者。进一步通过偏好优化训练引导模型，形成ThinkLogit-DPO。

Result: ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO在五个推理基准测试中分别实现了平均准确率24.5%和29.1%的相对提升，且ThinkLogit在不同模型家族间仍有效。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO在五个推理基准测试中分别实现了平均准确率24.5%和29.1%的相对提升，证明了其有效性。此外，ThinkLogit在不同模型家族之间也表现出色，并且与小模型的后训练方法正交，提供了一种无需昂贵后训练即可解锁大规模模型长推理能力的实用路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个将自然语言转换为生成性符号规则的框架，该框架在实验中表现出色，能够提高问题解决效率。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管SOAR是一种经典的基于符号的认知架构，但其实际应用受到手动规则编码的限制。大型语言模型具有高效生成规则的潜力，但目前的研究主要集中在概念框架上，缺乏坚实的实验验证。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为NL2GenSym的框架，该框架结合了大型语言模型（LLMs）和SOAR认知架构，通过执行基础的生成-批评机制，从自然语言中自动生成生成性符号规则。

Result: 在专门的Water Jug Problem数据集上，使用Gemini和Qwen系列模型进行的实验验证了框架的有效性。该框架在从自然语言生成规则方面取得了超过86%的成功率，并且生成的新启发式规则显著减少了决策周期。

Conclusion: 本文提出了NL2GenSym框架，该框架能够有效地将自然语言转换为生成性符号规则，并在Water Jug Problem数据集上验证了其有效性。此外，该框架还能生成新的启发式规则，显著提高了问题解决的效率。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了领域专用的微调在大型医学语言模型中的应用，提出了一种新的框架来捕捉微调引起的参数方向变化，并展示了其在提升指令遵循和生成质量方面的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究主要集中在自回归或通用指令模型上，而领域专用的LLM则研究不足。因此，我们需要对领域专用的微调进行系统研究。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为tuning vectors的新框架，该框架受任务向量启发，能够明确捕捉微调引起的参数方向变化。

Result: 我们的分析表明，微调仅修改了表示子空间的一小部分，基本上保持了预训练模型的表示。此外，结合不同领域的tuning vectors可以提高泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了对LLM适应的新见解，并提供了一个通用且可解释的框架来分析大型语言模型中的专业化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

Motivation: GRPO and related entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to entropy collapse or model collapse.

Motivation: 在数据可视化领域，自然语言中的歧义会影响生成代码的准确性。因此，需要一种方法来识别和减少这些歧义。

Method: 本文开发了一个歧义分类法，并提出了量化歧义的指标。同时，评估了三种语用模型来指导对话策略。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了在人机交互中建立共享目标的重要性，并提出了通过多轮对话减少歧义的方法，从而提高代码生成的准确性。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多尺度图思维链（MSGCOT）提示框架，通过整合多尺度结构信息，在图提示调优任务中取得了更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于单粒度（如节点级或子图级）进行提示生成，忽略了图数据中固有的多尺度结构信息，限制了提示语义的多样性。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级、低秩的粗化网络，以高效捕捉多尺度结构特征，并模仿人类从粗到细的认知过程，动态整合多尺度信息，形成渐进式的粗到细提示链。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法。

Conclusion: MSGCOT在少量样本场景中表现出色，展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的评估和基准测试方法依赖于完全标注的数据集，但这种方法成本高昂。因此，需要一种更高效的模型选择方法。

Method: LLM SELECTOR 是一种主动模型选择框架，通过自适应选择最具信息量的查询进行标注，并利用基于判断的 oracle 标注模型来减少标注成本。

Result: 在 6 个基准测试和 151 个 LLM 上的实验表明，LLM SELECTOR 在选择最佳和接近最佳的 LLM 时，可以将标注成本降低多达 59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR 可以在有限标注的情况下高效地选择最佳的 LLM，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Conclusion: 我们的结果提供了新的证据，表明LLMs发展出特定于实体的机制来表示和操作任何多标记实体，包括在训练期间未见过的实体。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full

attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a

specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型在逻辑推理中的泛化能力，发现它们在递归性方面表现良好，但在组合性方面存在不足。为此，本文提出了一种混合架构，结合符号推理与神经计算，以提高逻辑推理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经模型取得了显著进展，但它们在泛化方面的能力仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是在逻辑推理等应用中。本文旨在区分组合性和递归性，并探索如何提高神经推理系统的泛化能力。

Method: 本文使用三段论片段作为自然语言推理的基准，研究了预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）的逻辑泛化能力，并提出了一个混合架构来解决这些问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs在递归性方面表现出色，但在组合性方面存在困难。通过提出的混合架构，可以实现高效的推理并保持较高的效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种混合架构，结合符号推理与神经计算，以克服大型语言模型在组合性方面的局限性，并建立一个可靠的逻辑证明器。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

*Zhenhailong Wang,Jiateng Liu,Amin Fazel,Ritesh Sarkhel,Xing Fan,Xiang Li,Chenlei Guo,Heng Ji,Ruhi Sarikaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI)，一种将需要推理的多模态策略内化到模型参数中的新任务，无需在推理时包含策略。我们构建了两个数据集并提出了 TriMPI，一个三阶段的训练框架，在端到端准确性、泛化性和对遗忘的鲁棒性方面取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代对话代理如 ChatGPT 和 Alexa+ 依赖于指定元数据、回应风格和工具使用规则的预定义策略。随着这些基于 LLM 的系统扩展以支持各种商业和用户查询，这些策略（通常作为上下文提示实现）变得越来越复杂和冗长，使得忠实遵循变得困难，并且带来了大的固定计算成本。随着多模态代理的兴起，管理视觉和多模态行为的策略至关重要，但仍然研究不足。

Method: 我们构建了两个数据集，涵盖了合成和现实世界中的决策和工具使用任务，并提出了 TriMPI，一个三阶段的训练框架。TriMPI 首先通过持续预训练注入策略知识，然后进行监督微调，最后应用 PolicyRollout，这是一种 GRPO 风格的强化学习扩展，它通过具有策略意识的响应来增强轨迹。

Result: TriMPI 在端到端准确性、泛化性和对遗忘的鲁棒性方面取得了显著的提升。

Conclusion: MPI 是一项新的任务，它将需要推理的多模态策略内化到模型参数中，从而在不包含策略的情况下实现更强的策略遵循。作为第一项关于多模态策略内化的研究，我们提供了数据集、训练配方和全面评估以促进未来的研究。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 StatEval，这是第一个全面的统计基准，涵盖本科和研究生课程以及来自顶级期刊的研究级证明任务。通过设计一个可扩展的多代理管道和稳健的评估框架，实验结果显示当前 LLM 在统计推理方面存在明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和逻辑推理方面表现出显著进展，但统计学作为一个独特的综合学科，在基准测试中仍被忽视。

Method: 我们设计了一个可扩展的多代理管道，结合人工验证，以自动化大规模问题提取、重写和质量控制，同时确保学术严谨性。我们还提出了一个针对计算和证明任务的稳健评估框架，以实现对推理能力的细粒度评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，封闭源代码模型如 GPT5-mini 在研究级问题上的表现低于 57%，而开源模型的表现要低得多。这些发现突显了统计推理的独特挑战和当前 LLM 的局限性。

Conclusion: StatEval 可以作为推动大型语言模型统计智能发展的严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our
web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

TL;DR: 本文分析了影响模型性能估计排名可靠性的因素，并发现大型语言模型作为错误预测器在跨领域评估中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计模型性能而不依赖标签是理解NLP模型泛化的重要目标。然而，这些估计在不同领域中产生可靠性能排名的条件仍不清楚。

Method: 我们使用两步评估设置，包括四个基础分类器和几个大型语言模型作为错误预测器，分析了影响排名可靠性的因素。

Result: 实验表明，基于大型语言模型的错误预测器与真实准确率之间的排名相关性更强且更一致，优于基于漂移或零样本的基线。

Conclusion: 我们的结果明确了何时可以信任性能估计方法，并为跨领域模型评估中的使用提供了指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的口音不变的自动语音识别框架，通过结合口音和方言分类以及数据增强来提高模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的基于Transformer的模型在自动语音识别中取得了显著进展，但它们对口音和方言变化仍然敏感，导致英语和波斯语等语言的词错误率较高。为了应对这一挑战，我们需要一种更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于频谱图的分类器，以捕捉特定口音的线索，并通过掩码频谱图进行数据增强，从而提高自动语音识别模型对口音变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的掩码和增强策略在英语和波斯语设置中都显著降低了词错误率，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究推进了多语言自动语音识别系统的发展，使其能够抵御口音和方言的多样性。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

Motivation: Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of token-level supervision. We argue that the granularity of supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Method: We propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to regularize reasoning. We design a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems. Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model sizes.

Conclusion: GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems. Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model sizes.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MulTypo，一种多语言拼写错误生成算法，用于评估大语言模型在存在拼写错误情况下的鲁棒性。研究发现拼写错误会显著降低性能，尤其是在生成任务和需要推理的任务中。同时，高资源语言比低资源语言更稳健，从英语翻译比翻译成英语更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数基准假设输入是干净的，这使得大语言模型对拼写错误的鲁棒性在不同语言中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 我们引入了MulTypo，这是一种多语言拼写错误生成算法，基于语言特定的键盘布局和打字行为模拟人类类似的错误。我们评估了18个开源大语言模型，涵盖三个模型家族和五个下游任务。

Result: 拼写错误会持续降低性能，特别是在生成任务和需要推理的任务中——而自然语言推理任务相对更稳健。指令微调可以提高干净输入的性能，但在噪声下可能增加脆弱性。我们还观察到语言依赖的鲁棒性：高资源语言通常比低资源语言更稳健，从英语翻译比翻译成英语更稳健。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了需要进行噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估。我们公开了代码和数据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的强化学习方法SPG，用于改进扩散大语言模型的性能，在多个任务中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散大语言模型的不可行对数似然，传统的策略梯度方法无法直接应用，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)的方法，该方法利用了真实对数似然的上下界来解决扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在强化学习中的对齐问题。

Result: 实验表明，SPG在多个任务中显著优于现有的基线方法，显示出其有效性。

Conclusion: SPG显著优于基于ELBO或单步估计的基线方法，特别是在GSM8K、MATH500、Countdown和Sudoku任务中，相比最先进的RL方法提高了3.6%、2.6%、18.4%和27.0%。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在解决DLLMs在并行解码和因果顺序之间的核心矛盾，即并行-顺序矛盾（PSC）。

Method: 本文引入了三个用于DLLMs的扩展维度：并行、扩散和顺序，并通过实证研究分析了PSC的影响。

Result: 研究表明，随着任务难度增加，DLLMs会退化为自回归行为，而自回归提示会增加解码步骤但不提高质量。此外，PSC限制了DLLMs的自我反思、推理深度和探索广度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了几种实用的缓解措施，以减少PSC引起的低效和无效率。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多阶段框架，用于多语言医学视频检索，通过结合多语言语义、领域术语和高效处理，提高了检索的准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从多语言医学档案中检索相关教学视频对于跨语言边界回答复杂、多跳问题至关重要。然而，现有系统要么将长达一小时的视频压缩成粗粒度嵌入，要么在细粒度匹配上产生高昂的成本。

Method: 提出了一种多阶段框架，结合了多语言语义、领域术语和高效的长文本处理。视频字幕被分成语义连贯的块，并用简洁的知识图（KG）事实进行增强，组织成层次树，其节点嵌入由语言无关的多语言编码器生成。在查询时，相同的编码器对输入问题进行嵌入；粗到细的树搜索会修剪不相关的分支，只有排名靠前的块会被轻量级大语言模型（LLM）重新评分。

Result: 在mVCR测试集上的实验表明了最先进的性能，消融研究证实了KG增强、层次索引和有针对性的LLM重新排序的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了一个准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型（LRMs）越来越多地依赖逐步思考（CoT）推理来提高任务性能，但多语言环境中的思维轨迹仍缺乏研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索多语言CoT推理的各个方面。

Method: 本文评估了三个关键维度：性能、一致性和忠实性，通过测量语言合规性、答案准确性和答案一致性，以及交换思维轨迹来评估跨语言一致性，并使用扰动技术来探测思维轨迹的忠实性。

Result: 研究发现，语言偏好显著，不同语言的表现差异较大；思维轨迹的质量和效果取决于提示语言；模型在不同程度上依赖思维轨迹。

Conclusion: 本文提出了对多语言CoT推理的首次全面研究，揭示了语言偏好、思维轨迹的一致性和忠实性问题，并释放了代码和数据以支持未来的研究。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Motivation: 以往的研究表明，世界知识对于预测话语连接词至关重要，而语言模型通常在此任务上表现良好。我们反其道而行之，研究话语连接词是否能帮助语言模型了解世界。

Method: 我们提出了WUGNECTIVES数据集，用于评估语言模型在连词将实体与特定属性联系起来的上下文中对新实体的推理能力。我们研究了17种不同规模和训练方案的语言模型。

Result: 我们发现，调整语言模型以表现出推理行为在大多数连接词上取得了显著改进。然而，所有模型在表示让步意义的连接词上都表现不佳。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果为更细致地探讨语言提示在语言模型中的功能角色铺平了道路。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Result: 与PRBench上的直接LLM流水线相比，PRAgent表现出显著的改进，包括总观看时间增加了604%，点赞数增加了438%，整体参与度至少提高了2.9倍。消融研究显示，平台建模和定向推广对这些成果贡献最大。

Conclusion: 我们的结果将AutoPR定位为一个可行且可衡量的研究问题，并为可扩展、有影响力的自动学术传播提供了路线图。

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Dyna-Mind，一个两阶段的训练框架，用于增强AI代理的模拟能力，使其在复杂交互环境中更有效地推理、规划和行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的AI代理需要'替代性试错'，即在行动前在脑海中模拟替代的未来，以增强其在复杂交互环境中的理解和性能。

Method: 我们引入了Dyna-Mind，这是一个两阶段的训练框架，明确教导（V）LM代理将这种模拟整合到他们的推理中。第一阶段引入了ReSim，第二阶段提出了Dyna-GRPO。

Result: 实验表明，(1) ReSim有效地将模拟能力注入AI代理，(2) Dyna-GRPO利用结果和交互级信号来学习更好的策略，以处理长视野、计划密集型任务。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了模拟在使AI代理在越来越具有挑战性的环境中更有效地推理、规划和行动中的核心作用。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

*Donghang Wu,Haoyang Zhang,Jun Chen,Xiangyu,Zhang,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng,Fei Tian,Xuerui Yang,Xiangyu Zhang,Daxin Jiang,Gang Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS)，一种受大脑启发的框架，使实时推理成为可能。通过采用双脑方法，MPS显著优于现有方法，并在推理性能上与预先计算完整CoT的模型相当，同时大大降低了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时口语语言模型（SLMs）难以利用链式思维（CoT）推理，因为生成整个思维过程的顺序具有很高的延迟。让SLMs在说话时思考，类似于人类，正受到越来越多的关注。

Method: 我们提出了Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS)，这是一个受大脑启发的框架，使高保真、实时推理成为可能。我们采用了一种新的双脑方法，使用一个“形成大脑”进行高层次推理来引导一个独立的“表达大脑”进行流畅的语音生成。

Result: 实验表明，MPS显著优于现有的边想边说方法，并且在推理性能上与预先计算完整CoT的模型相当，同时大大降低了延迟。在零延迟配置下，所提出的方法在数学推理任务Spoken-MQA上达到了92.8%的准确率，并在语音对话任务URO-Bench上获得了82.5分。

Conclusion: 我们的工作有效地弥合了高质量推理和实时交互之间的差距。

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

*Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-TTS is a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy that enhances LLM reasoning by leveraging a small pool of manually selected instances and varying exemplar augmentation at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curating large reasoning datasets for LLMs is laborious and resource-intensive. P-TTS aims to enhance LLM reasoning through finetuning with minimal annotation overhead.

Method: P-TTS is an inference-time data augmentation strategy that leverages a small pool of manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time.

Result: P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform prior baselines on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving significant accuracy gains. P-TTS also improves zero-shot generalization on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: P-TTS offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

### [110] [Optimizing delivery for quick commerce factoring qualitative assessment of generated routes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08671)
*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的框架，用于评估VRP生成的路线，以提高最后一英里物流的效率和可靠性。研究发现，LLMs能够有效地识别路由问题，并在成本效率、交付可靠性和可持续性方面具有重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电子商务市场预计将迅速增长，最后一英里配送占运营成本的一半。尽管基于车辆路径问题（VRP）的求解器被广泛用于配送规划，但由于非结构化地址、不完整的地图和距离估计的计算限制，它们在现实场景中的效果有限。

Method: 本研究提出了一种框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）对VRP生成的路线进行基于政策的评估，使物流公司能够评估和优先考虑更高效的配送计划。通过使用大型语言模型生成、注释和评估了400个案例。

Result: 研究发现，开源LLMs以79%的准确率识别了路由问题，而专有的推理模型达到了86%。结果表明，基于LLMs的VRP生成路线评估可以作为有效的和可扩展的评估层，超越传统的距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的VRP生成路线评估可以作为一种有效且可扩展的评估层，超越传统的距离和时间指标。这对于提高成本效率、交付可靠性和可持续性在最后一英里物流中具有重要意义，特别是在印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了生成更稳健和高效的启发式方法，需要结合LLM和解释工具来改进现有技术。

Method: 让LLM接触到启发式表现不佳的实例，解释问题发生的原因，并针对输入空间的不同区域进行专门设计。

Result: 所生成的启发式方法在最坏情况下的性能比FunSearch提高了约28倍，同时改善了平均性能并保持了运行时间。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于启发式设计的方法与解释启发式表现不佳的原因和如何修复它们的工具相结合，可以生成更稳健和高效的启发式方法。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [112] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和AI评估者都存在对人类创作的偏向，但AI的偏向更强，并且这种偏差会因归属标签而改变评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，我们需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格，这是一个缺乏客观标准且判断本质上主观的领域。

Method: 我们使用Raymond Queneau的《风格练习》进行了受控实验，以测量评估者之间的归属偏差。研究1比较了人类参与者和AI模型在三种条件下的评估：盲测、准确标记和反事实标记。研究2测试了AI评估者和创作者之间的偏差泛化。

Result: 研究发现，人类表现出+13.7个百分点的偏向（Cohen's h = 0.28），而AI模型表现出+34.3个百分点的偏向（h = 0.70），后者是前者的2.5倍。研究2确认了这种偏差在AI架构中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 我们的研究首次在审美判断中对人类和人工智能评估者的归属偏差进行了受控比较，揭示了人工智能系统不仅复制而且放大了这种人类倾向。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Motivation: 同行评审是科学出版的核心，但存在不一致、评审者主观性和可扩展性挑战。

Method: 我们引入了ReviewerToo，这是一个模块化框架，用于研究和部署AI辅助同行评审，以补充人类判断并提供系统性和一致性的评估。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的一个精心策划的1,963篇论文提交数据集上，我们的实验使用gpt-oss-120b模型实现了81.8%的准确率，将论文分类为接受/拒绝，相比平均人类评审者的83.9%。此外，由ReviewerToo生成的评审被LLM评委评为质量更高，尽管仍落后于最强专家贡献。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为系统化、混合的同行评审系统提供了基础，可以随着科学出版的增长而扩展。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了语义条件调优（SCT）方法，用于将知识图谱与大型语言模型融合，以提高知识密集型任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前缀调优方法简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入连接，忽略了KG中的丰富关系语义，并给LLM带来了显著的隐式推理负担。

Method: 提出了一种新的知识注入范式，称为语义条件调优（SCT），包括两个关键模块：语义图模块和条件自适应融合模块。

Result: 在知识图谱基准上的大量实验表明，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调节输入表示，SCT提供了更直接和强大的信号，使知识推理更准确和稳健。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种连续记忆方法，用于增强 GUI 代理的能力，使其能够在不熟悉的界面和长期任务中更好地泛化。通过使用 VLM 作为编码器，该方法减少了上下文成本并保留了细粒度的视觉信息。实验表明，该方法在现实世界的 GUI 基准测试中表现优异，甚至可以与最先进的闭源模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们研究如何赋予 GUI 代理可扩展的记忆，以帮助在不熟悉的界面和长期任务中进行泛化。之前的 GUI 代理将过去的轨迹压缩成文本标记，这会增加上下文长度并遗漏关键的视觉线索（例如精确的控件大小和位置）。

Method: 我们提出了一种连续记忆，使用 VLM 本身作为编码器，将每个 GUI 轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入序列；这些嵌入直接插入到主干的输入层，显著减少了上下文成本，同时保留了细粒度的视觉信息。我们引入了一个自动扩展的数据飞轮来以低成本增长记忆。

Result: 使用这个管道，我们收集了 100k+ 轨迹，花费约 4000 美元，并仅用 1,500 个样本微调记忆编码器（LoRA 在 Q-Former 上，1.2% 的参数）。在现实世界的 GUI 基准测试中，我们的记忆增强代理在长时间范围和分布变化下 consistently 提高了成功率。

Conclusion: 我们的记忆增强代理在现实世界的GUI基准测试中 consistently 改进了长时间范围和分布变化下的成功率。值得注意的是，Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + 连续记忆的表现与最先进的闭源模型（例如 GPT-4o、Claude-4）相当。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个新的基准，用于评估大型语言模型的编码能力。实验结果显示，尽管GPT-5表现良好，但仍不及顶尖人类选手，且开放权重模型与前沿封闭模型之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的编码基准存在缺乏极具挑战性的问题、测试用例覆盖不足以及依赖在线平台API等问题。为了克服这些限制，提出了LiveOIBench基准。

Method: 引入了LiveOIBench基准，包含403个专家精心挑选的奥林匹克级编程问题，并通过详细分析评估了32个流行的通用和推理LLMs的表现。

Result: GPT-5在LiveOIBench上达到了81.76百分位，而顶尖人类选手通常位于90百分位以上。开放权重的推理模型如GPT-OSS-120B仅达到60百分位，显示出与前沿封闭模型之间的显著能力差距。

Conclusion: LiveOIBench是一个全面的基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的编码能力。实验结果表明，GPT-5在该基准上表现优异，但仍然不及顶尖人类选手。此外，开放权重的推理模型与前沿封闭模型之间存在显著的能力差距。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在视觉估计任务中的表现有限，且推理时间扩展带来的收益微乎其微，因此需要一种新的方法来改进视觉感知。

Method: 本文提出了Perception-Time Scaling（PTS）范式，结合强化学习技术，以提高视觉估计任务的精度。

Result: PTS显著提高了DisTANCE数据集上的高精度性能，从8.0%提升到64.7%，并且在域外任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的感知时间扩展（PTS）范式，通过鼓励丰富的感知和分解复杂的感知问题，显著提高了视觉估计任务的精度。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，发现视觉编码器中的不确定视觉标记是导致幻觉的关键因素，并提出了一种通过修改视觉编码器来减轻幻觉的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们认为视觉编码器中的不确定视觉标记是导致物体幻觉的关键因素。我们的统计分析发现，具有高认知不确定性的视觉标记与幻觉的发生存在正相关关系。此外，我们理论上和实证上展示了在小对抗扰动下，早期视觉编码器层中表现出大表示偏差的视觉标记表明高认知不确定性。

Method: 我们提出了一种简单而有效的方法，通过仅修改视觉编码器来减轻物体幻觉。该方法包括一个使用对抗性扰动的代理方法，用于高效识别不确定的视觉标记，以及在视觉编码器中间层的自注意力过程中遮罩这些不确定的视觉标记的方法，从而抑制它们对视觉编码的影响并减轻幻觉。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，我们的方法显著减少了LVLM中的物体幻觉，并可以与其他先前技术协同工作。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著减少了LVLM中的物体幻觉，并可以与其他先前技术协同工作。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏的地区，早期准确诊断肩部疾病面临重大挑战，需要低成本且易于扩展的辅助诊断解决方案。

Method: 本研究引入了消费级设备拍摄的视频作为诊断基础，并提出了混合运动视频诊断框架（HMVDx），该框架将动作理解和疾病诊断任务分别由两个多模态大语言模型完成。

Result: 实验比较表明，HMVDx在诊断肩关节损伤方面的准确性比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%，这为未来多模态大语言模型在医学视频理解中的应用提供了重要的技术贡献。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了低成本的多模态大语言模型在医学应用中的潜力，特别是在肩部疾病初步诊断中的应用。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CapGeo框架和CapGeo-Bench数据集，通过文本描述辅助几何推理，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在几何问题上表现不佳，尽管它们在文本推理任务中表现出色。这表明问题在于对几何图示的理解而非推理本身。因此，本文旨在通过文本描述来辅助几何推理。

Method: CapGeo框架通过将视觉内容转换为文本描述，从而帮助模型更好地理解几何图示。同时，CapGeo-Bench数据集用于评估几何描述的质量，并提供了一个基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，使用CapGeo框架后，模型在几何问题上的表现显著提高。例如，Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升至59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升至73.0%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于文本描述的几何推理框架CapGeo，并创建了一个名为CapGeo-Bench的数据集，以系统评估和提升多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面的能力。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

*Ruyi Xu,Guangxuan Xiao,Yukang Chen,Liuning He,Kelly Peng,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingVLM is a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. It uses a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference, maintaining a compact KV cache and employing a simple SFT strategy to mimic inference-time attention patterns. The model performs well on long videos and improves general VQA abilities without specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models (VLMs) face a critical challenge in understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos, while simple sliding window methods are flawed due to broken coherence or high latency from redundant recomputation.

Method: StreamingVLM is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. It maintains a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. A simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy is used to mimic the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts.

Result: On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. The SFT strategy also improves performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96.

Conclusion: StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. The SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了注意力机制中归一化方法的局限性，通过理论分析和实验验证，发现随着所选标记数量的增加，模型区分信息标记的能力会下降，并且在训练过程中存在梯度敏感性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文研究了注意力机制中归一化方法的局限性。

Method: 我们从一个理论框架开始，该框架能够识别模型的选择能力以及在标记选择中的几何分离。我们的分析包括在softmax缩放下的距离显式界限和标记向量的分离标准。通过使用预训练的GPT-2模型进行实验，我们验证了理论结果并分析了注意力机制的关键行为。

Result: 我们证明了随着所选标记数量的增加，模型区分信息标记的能力会下降，通常会收敛到均匀的选择模式。我们还表明，在softmax归一化下的梯度敏感性在训练过程中带来了挑战，尤其是在低温设置下。

Conclusion: 这些发现加深了对基于softmax的注意力机制的理解，并促使未来注意力架构需要更稳健的归一化和选择策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Energy-Driven Steering (EDS)的新方法，用于解决大型语言模型（LLMs）安全对齐中的问题。该方法通过动态的推理时干预，有效降低了错误拒绝率，同时保持了基础的安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的对齐技术往往只关注提高对有害提示的安全性，导致LLM变得过于谨慎，拒绝回答无害提示。因此，安全对齐的关键目标是提高安全性的同时减少错误拒绝。

Method: 本文引入了Energy-Driven Steering (EDS)，一种无需微调的框架，通过动态的推理时干预来解决安全对齐的问题。训练了一个轻量级的外部能量模型（EBM）来分配高能量到不希望的状态，低能量到期望的状态。在推理过程中，EBM将LLM的内部激活映射到“能量景观”，并利用能量函数的梯度动态引导LLM的隐藏状态到低能量区域，从而实时纠正模型生成期望的响应。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文的方法成功实现了这一目标：显著降低了错误拒绝率。例如，在ORB-H基准测试中，合规性从57.3%提升到82.6%，同时保持了基线安全性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的无微调框架Energy-Driven Steering (EDS)，通过动态的推理时干预来解决安全对齐的问题。该方法能够有效降低错误拒绝率，同时保持基础的安全性能，为构建既低错误拒绝率又高安全性的大型语言模型提供了一个有效的范式。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，用于量化FL中的内部和跨客户端记忆，并发现了FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是内部数据，这受到训练和推理因素的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FL记忆检测技术仅关注单个样本，低估了跨样本记忆的更细微风险。而集中式学习的方法无法直接应用于FL。

Method: 提出了一种框架，使用跨所有客户端的细粒度交叉样本记忆测量来量化FL中的内部和跨客户端记忆。

Result: 研究发现FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是内部客户端数据，这受到训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是内部客户端数据，这受到训练和推理因素的影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本嵌入方法通常只处理原始文本，忽略了超链接或引用等丰富的结构信息，而这些信息在许多现实数据集中提供了关键上下文。

Method: 本文引入并系统评估了一种新的生成结构感知文本嵌入的范式，通过将这些结构关系直接整合到LLM的内部编码过程中，而不是依赖传统的后期聚合方法。研究了两种主要的在过程中的方法：顺序连接和并行缓存。

Result: 通过在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务上的广泛零样本实验，证明了我们的结构感知方法在性能上优于仅文本和后期聚合基线。分析揭示了关键权衡：顺序连接在噪声较大、中等长度的上下文中表现优异，而并行缓存在长、高信号上下文中扩展性更好，但更容易受到干扰。

Conclusion: 本文提供了第一个关于过程内结构感知编码的全面分析，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为自适应时间掩码（ATM）的新训练方法，以解决稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）中的特征吸收问题，实验表明 ATM 在降低吸收分数的同时保持了良好的重建质量，为神经网络中学习稳定且可解释的特征提供了一个有原则的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 SAE 训练方法面临特征吸收问题，即特征（或神经元）相互吸收以最小化 $L_1$ 惩罚，使得一致地识别和分析模型行为变得困难。

Method: 我们引入了自适应时间掩码（ATM），这是一种新的训练方法，通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重建贡献来动态调整特征选择，计算随时间变化的重要性分数，并基于这些重要性分数的统计阈值应用概率掩码机制，从而创建更自然的特征选择过程。

Result: 通过在 Gemma-2-2b 模型上的广泛实验，我们证明 ATM 相比现有的方法如 TopK 和 JumpReLU SAEs 实现了显著更低的吸收分数，同时保持了出色的重建质量。

Conclusion: ATM 是一种有原则的解决方案，用于在神经网络中学习稳定且可解释的特征，为更可靠的模型分析提供了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Motivation: 解决RLIR在性能和稳定性方面落后于RLVR的问题，特别是在无标签数据设置下。

Method: 提出了一种基于集成奖励的强化学习方法（RLER），通过聚合多种模型并适应奖励插值和滚动选择来减轻系统偏差。

Result: RLER在RLIR基础上提高了+13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，并在无标签样本上实现了稳定的扩展。

Conclusion: RLER在无标签样本上实现了稳定的扩展，表现出色，具有很高的应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

*Yumin Choi,Dongki Kim,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces multimodal prompt optimization and proposes MPO, a framework that improves the performance of MLLMs by optimizing prompts across multiple modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in prompt optimization approaches, which are currently confined to text and limit the full potential of MLLMs.

Method: The authors propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that performs joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates and guides the selection process of candidate prompts using a Bayesian-based selection strategy.

Result: MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods in experiments across diverse modalities such as images, videos, and molecules.

Conclusion: MPO demonstrates that multimodal prompt optimization is a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HINT, an adaptive hinting framework that improves the training affinity of reinforcement learning for large language models, leading to better performance and stability in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core issue underlying the failures of existing methods is low training affinity, which arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.

Method: We propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness, an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data efficiency.

Conclusion: HINT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on

*Yuxuan Jiang,Zehua Chen,Zeqian Ju,Yusheng Dai,Weibei Dou,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ControlAudio的渐进式扩散建模方法，用于实现更精确的文本到音频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据稀缺，现有的文本到音频生成方法在大规模生成性能上仍然受到限制。

Method: 将可控的文本到音频生成重新构造成多任务学习问题，并引入了一种渐进式扩散建模方法ControlAudio。

Result: ControlAudio在客观和主观评估中都表现出色，展示了其在时间精度和语音清晰度方面的优势。

Conclusion: ControlAudio在时间精度和语音清晰度方面达到了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g.,
precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in
recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation
performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast
controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a
progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits
distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text,
timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we
propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation,
augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme.
Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT)
on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then
incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic
representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we
propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more
fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling
nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity,
significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective
evaluations. Demo samples are available at:

*Graham Tierney,Srikar Katta,Christopher Bail,Sunshine Hillygus,Alexander Volfovsky*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的实验设计，以处理潜在的混杂因素并准确估计处理效果。通过一个评估表达谦逊在政治传播中的说服力的实验，我们发现基于LLM的方法不如简单的词袋模型有效，并且隔离了表达谦逊对政治陈述的感知说服力的因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多社会科学问题询问语言属性如何因果影响受众的态度和行为。由于文本属性通常相互关联，我们必须控制潜在的混杂因素以隔离因果效应。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的实验设计，以处理潜在的混杂因素，避免重叠问题，并无偏估计处理效果。我们还应用这种设计在一个评估表达谦逊在政治传播中的说服力的实验中。

Result: 我们展示了基于LLM的方法在我们的真实文本和实验结果中表现得比简单的词袋模型还要差。

Conclusion: 我们隔离了表达谦逊对政治陈述的感知说服力的因果效应，为社交媒体平台、政策制定者和社会科学家提供了关于传播效果的新见解。

Abstract: Many social science questions ask how linguistic properties causally affect
an audience's attitudes and behaviors. Because text properties are often
interlinked (e.g., angry reviews use profane language), we must control for
possible latent confounding to isolate causal effects. Recent literature
proposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations
of text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However,
because the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods
risk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself,
inducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we
introduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the
overlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design
in an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in
political communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based
methods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text
and outcomes from our experiment. Substantively, we isolate the causal effect
of expressing humility on the perceived persuasiveness of political statements,
offering new insights on communication effects for social media platforms,
policy makers, and social scientists.

### [133] [HES-SQL: Hybrid Reasoning for Efficient Text-to-SQL with Structural Skeleton Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08896)
*Suming Qiu,Jing Li,Zhicheng Zhou,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文介绍了HES-SQL，一个结合监督微调和强化学习的文本到SQL生成框架，通过三个创新点提高了SQL查询的准确性和执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在推进文本到SQL生成技术，通过结合监督微调和强化学习方法，提升生成SQL查询的准确性和执行效率。

Method: 我们提出了HES-SQL，一种新颖的混合训练框架，通过将思维模式融合的监督微调（SFT）与组相对策略优化（GRPO）相结合，推进了文本到SQL生成。我们的方法引入了三个关键创新：(1) 一种骨架完整性评分机制，增强了生成查询与最优SQL结构之间的偏好对齐；(2) 一种查询延迟感知奖励系统，激励生成计算高效的SQL查询；(3) 一种思维模式完成的自我蒸馏过程，防止模型推理能力的退化。该框架使混合思维模型能够在推理和非推理模式之间切换，同时提高SQL查询的准确性和执行效率。

Result: 实验评估在MySQL 8.0和SQLite 3.42上进行，在受控单用户条件下，HES-SQL在BIRD和KaggleDBQA基准测试中分别实现了79.14%和54.9%的执行准确性。查询延迟测量为生成查询在DBMS上的端到端执行时间，多次运行后取平均值以减少方差。相对于监督基线，效率增益范围为11%至20%。

Conclusion: 我们的结果确立了文本到SQL系统的新型范式，通过执行感知强化学习（RL）有效平衡语义准确性与计算效率。所提出的方法对于开发健壮的自然语言数据库接口具有重要意义，并可以扩展到需要正确性和效率优化的更广泛的结构化生成任务。

Abstract: We present HES-SQL, a novel hybrid training framework that advances
Text-to-SQL generation through the integration of thinking-mode-fused
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness
scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries
and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that
incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a
self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents
degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables
hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes
while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency.
  Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under
controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves
competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\% and 54.9\% on the
BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the
end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over
multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\% to 20\%
relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for
Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with
computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning
(RL). The proposed methodology has significant implications for developing
robust natural language interfaces to databases and can be extended to broader
structured generation tasks requiring both correctness and efficiency
optimization.

### [134] [Estimating Brain Activity with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution using a Naturalistic MEG-fMRI Encoding Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09415)
*Beige Jerry Jin,Leila Wehbe*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于Transformer的编码模型，结合MEG和fMRI数据，实现了高时空分辨率的脑图谱映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前非侵入性神经成像技术在空间分辨率和时间分辨率之间存在权衡，而现有的源定位或MEG-fMRI融合方法难以解决单次试验自然数据的统一图像问题。

Method: 本文开发了一个基于Transformer的编码模型，结合来自两个自然主义语音理解实验的MEG和fMRI数据，以高时空分辨率估计潜在皮层源响应。

Result: 该模型能够更好地预测MEG，并且在模拟实验中比经典最小范数解法具有更高的空间和时间保真度。此外，该模型在未见过的受试者和模态上表现出很强的泛化能力，并且在全新数据集上比ECoG训练的编码模型更能预测ECoG。

Conclusion: 通过整合大规模自然实验、MEG、fMRI和编码模型，本文提出了一种实现毫秒级和毫米级脑图谱的实用方法。

Abstract: Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial
resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can
capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both
high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source
localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial
naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively
to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an
open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based
encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic
speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses
with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and
fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents
our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better
than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields
source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic
minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated
latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects
and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict
electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an
entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic
experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route
towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLMs在面对间接提示注入攻击时的脆弱性，发现现有模型仍存在显著安全漏洞，并提出了加强训练、建立攻击数据库和统一测试框架等建议以提高安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地与外部数据源交互，间接提示注入成为一种关键且不断演变的攻击向量，能够通过操纵输入来利用模型。因此，有必要分析当前LLMs的脆弱性并提出改进措施。

Method: 我们对不同模型上的间接提示注入攻击进行了系统评估，分析了当前LLMs对这种攻击的易感性，以及模型大小、制造商、具体实现等因素如何影响其脆弱性，并研究了哪些攻击方法仍然最有效。

Result: 我们的结果表明，即使是一些广为人知的攻击模式仍然有效，暴露了模型防御中的持续弱点。

Conclusion: 我们的研究发现，当前的LLMs仍然无法缓解长期存在的威胁，因此需要加强训练过程、建立集中攻击向量数据库以及统一的测试框架，以确保持续的安全验证，并推动开发者将安全性融入LLM的核心设计中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now routinely used to autonomously execute
complex tasks, from natural language processing to dynamic workflows like web
searches. The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both
their functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact
with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and
evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through
manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt
injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current
LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and
manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which
attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known
attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model
defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for
strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized
database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified
testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are
essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design
of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate
long-standing threats.

*Ahmed Adel Attia,Jing Liu,Carol Espy Wilson*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用发音特征作为辅助任务和伪输入的框架，在低资源条件下显著提升了自动语音识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究已经探讨了发音特征作为自动语音识别（ASR）的补充表示的使用，但它们的使用主要局限于浅层声学模型。在深度学习时代，我们重新审视发音信息，并提出一个框架，利用发音表示作为辅助任务和识别模型的伪输入。

Method: 我们采用语音反转作为辅助预测任务，并将预测的发音特征作为查询流注入模型中，与声学嵌入作为键和值进行交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上的实验表明，我们的方法在强Transformer基线之上取得了持续的改进，尤其是在低资源条件下。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，当用现代架构重新引入时，曾经在ASR研究中被忽视的发音特征可以提供有意义的好处。

Abstract: Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as
complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their
use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit
articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework
that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a
pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion
as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are
injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with
acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate
that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based
baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest
that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide
meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态标注策略和基于交叉注意力的序列模型，用于捕捉语音中的时间压力进展，并在多个数据集上取得了显著的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测语音中的心理压力在高压环境中至关重要。虽然以前的工作利用了声学特征进行压力检测，但大多数都将压力视为静态标签。

Method: 我们提出了一个动态标注策略，从情感标签中推导出细粒度的压力注释，并引入了基于交叉注意力的序列模型，包括单向LSTM和Transformer编码器，以捕捉时间上的压力进展。

Result: 我们的方法在MuSE（+5%）和StressID（+18%）上超过了现有基线，并且在自定义的真实世界数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在MuSE和StressID数据集上取得了显著的准确率提升，并且在自定义的真实世界数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。这些结果突显了将压力建模为动态构造成分的价值。

Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure
settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress
detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress
as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state.
We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress
annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based
sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture
temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on
MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to
a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling
stress as a dynamic construct in speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺的环境中，使Whisper更轻更快以适应边缘设备。

Method: 通过低秩分解和特征蒸馏压缩嵌入，而不是删除层，而是合并层以限制性能损失。

Result: 最终模型保留了90%的原始性能，体积减小了48%，在MacBook Air M1上速度快了2.15倍。

Conclusion: 最终模型在保持90%原始性能的同时，体积减小了48%，在MacBook Air M1上速度快了2.15倍。

Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is
challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover
performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains
on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can
Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings?
Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new
pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to
frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with
low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers,
we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the
original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air
M1.

TL;DR: 研究发现，词段表示的变化是零资源词分割和聚类系统性能的主要限制因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨在理想情况下，性能限制是由词段的表示还是聚类方法导致的。

Method: 研究结合了多种自监督语音特征（连续/离散、帧/词级）与不同的聚类方法（K-means、层次化、基于图的）在英语和普通话数据上进行实验。

Result: 最佳系统使用基于动态时间规整的图聚类方法，在连续特征上表现最好。更快的替代方案使用基于余弦距离的图聚类或基于编辑距离的离散单元序列。

Conclusion: 研究发现，同一词类的不同段之间的表示变化是性能的主要限制因素，而不是聚类方法。

Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech
into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the
induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold
word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of
word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like
types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features
(continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods
(K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best
system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features.
Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged
continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through
controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the
clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across
segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary
factor limiting performance.

Motivation: 现有的说话人匿名化研究主要集中在单说话人音频上，而本文关注的是多说话人对话音频中的匿名化问题，特别是在只需要匿名化一个目标说话人的情况下。这种场景在电话中心等环境中非常重要，因为需要保护客户的隐私。

Method: 本文探讨了在对话音频中针对特定说话人的匿名化策略，并提出了改进的评估方法。

Result: 本文提出了针对对话音频中目标说话人匿名化的有效策略，并指出了开发中的潜在问题，同时提出了改进的评估方法。

Conclusion: 本文旨在填补这些差距，通过探索对话音频中目标说话人匿名化的有效策略，并指出其开发中的潜在问题，同时提出相应的改进评估方法。

Abstract: Most of the existing speaker anonymization research has focused on
single-speaker audio, leading to the development of techniques and evaluation
metrics optimized for such condition. This study addresses the significant
challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio,
specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This
scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer
privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer's voice in interactions with
operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this
task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately
assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario.
This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for
targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential
problems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation
methodologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural
language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as
translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex
workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,
GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction
paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate
their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions
across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,
extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which
introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For
language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface
paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.
This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of
locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational
components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine
the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating
user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is
conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess
performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present
study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance
trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable
components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study
inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI
infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes
more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded
intelligence.

Conclusion: 本文介绍了BigCodeArena平台，该平台用于代码生成的开放人类评估，并基于收集的数据创建了两个基准测试BigCodeReward和AutoCodeArena。研究发现，专有大型语言模型在代码生成性能上仍然领先。

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable
real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model
responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of
LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding
long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this
end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code
generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment.
Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of
LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and
outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions
across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution
environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700
multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers
underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by
tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding
and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based
on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For
BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the
consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows
that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the
execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose
AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding
quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation
performance among recent emerging models.

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various
programming language concepts. These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient
code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we
introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples
of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining
systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together
with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We
then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive
evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are
effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在增加推理模式时表现出显著的准确性提升，但推理也带来了显著的推理延迟和令牌使用成本，这对许多简单提示来说是不必要的。

Method: 提出了一种基于语义的路由器，根据查询的推理需求进行分类，并仅在有益时应用推理。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro基准测试中，准确性提高了10.2个百分点，响应延迟减少了47.1%，令牌消耗减少了48.5%。

Conclusion: 语义路由提供了一种在开源大型语言模型服务系统中平衡准确性和效率的有效机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when
augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time
scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency
and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are
unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that
classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively
applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage
point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response
latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference
with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective
mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source
LLM serving systems
