### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的共训练框架，用于提高大型语言模型的内容安全性，能够在单个SFT阶段内动态激活多种安全行为，并实现细粒度控制，实验结果表明其在安全性方面表现优异，且训练和部署成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前内容安全方法（如SFT和RLHF）依赖多阶段训练流程，缺乏部署后的细粒度控制。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一个统一的共训练框架，以提高模型的安全性和可控性。

Method: 本文提出了一种统一的共训练框架，通过简单的系统级指令或魔术标记，在单个SFT阶段内动态激活不同的安全行为（如正面、负面和拒绝性行为），从而实现推理时的隐蔽和高效行为切换。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在安全性方面与SFT+DPO相当，8B模型在安全性性能上甚至超过了671B的DeepSeek-R1模型，同时显著降低了训练复杂性和部署成本。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种统一的共训练框架，能够高效整合多种安全行为，并在输出空间中引入了安全对齐边界，提供了模型安全性的实证证据，同时实现了前所未有的细粒度控制。实验表明，该方法在安全性方面与SFT+DPO相当，且在训练复杂性和部署成本上显著降低。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

TL;DR: WMT25机器翻译任务的初步排名基于自动评估，可能偏向使用重排序技术的系统，最终排名将由人工评估决定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分享初步结果以帮助参与者准备系统提交论文。

Method: 通过自动评估对机器翻译系统进行初步排名。

Result: 初步排名可能有偏差，官方排名将基于人工评估。

Conclusion: 自动评估可能偏向使用重排序技术的系统，最终排名将基于人工评估。

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于大语言模型驱动的文化本地化数学应用题的框架，以解决低资源语言中缺乏社会文化任务数据集的问题。实验表明，该框架可以减轻英语中心实体偏见，并在各种语言中引入本地实体时提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言基准大多通过翻译生成，通常保留英语中心实体，由于人工注释的本地化成本高，自动化本地化工具有限，因此真正本地化的数据集仍然稀缺。

Method: 本文提出了一种框架，用于大语言模型驱动的文化本地化数学应用题的自动构建，以解决低资源语言中缺乏社会文化任务数据集的问题。

Result: 实验表明，翻译的基准可能在适当的社会文化背景下掩盖真正的多语言数学能力。此外，本文的框架可以减轻英语中心实体偏见，并在各种语言中引入本地实体时提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种用于大语言模型驱动的文化本地化数学应用题的框架，该框架能够从现有资源中自动构建包含本地名称、组织和货币的数据集。实验表明，该框架可以减轻英语中心实体偏见，并在各种语言中引入本地实体时提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过少量数据资源改进通用指令调整的大语言模型用于机器翻译，并展示了微调模型在翻译维基百科文章时的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何使用相对少量易于生产的资源来改进通用指令调整的大语言模型用于机器翻译。

Method: 我们使用直接偏好优化（DPO）训练，在程序上策划和增强的公共数据集子集上改进了GaMS-9B-Instruct模型。

Result: 我们的微调模型在翻译维基百科文章时分别比参与数据集生成的两个模型表现更好，提高了约0.04和0.02的COMET分数，并且更一致地避免了语言和格式错误。

Conclusion: 我们的微调模型在翻译维基百科文章时分别比基准模型提高了约0.04和0.02的COMET分数，并且更一致地避免了语言和格式错误。

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个新的多语言数据集（MultiCoXQL和Compass），以改善ConvXAI系统在多语言环境下的表现，并评估了不同模型在这两个数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的ConvXAI系统在多语言泛化和自定义输入提取方面存在挑战，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下。本文旨在解决这些问题，以提高ConvXAI系统的性能和适用性。

Method: 本文首先引入了MultiCoXQL，这是一个多语言扩展的CoXQL数据集，涵盖了五种语言。然后提出了一种新的解析方法，用于提高多语言解析性能，并使用不同的解析策略在MultiCoXQL上评估了三种大型语言模型。此外，还介绍了Compass，这是一个新的多语言数据集，用于ConvXAI系统中的自定义输入提取，并在Compass上进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估，使用了三种不同大小的大型语言模型和BERT类型模型。

Result: 本文提出的MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集能够有效支持多语言ConvXAI系统的开发。同时，评估结果表明，不同模型在这些数据集上的表现各有优劣，为后续研究提供了参考。

Conclusion: 本文提出了MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集，以解决当前ConvXAI系统在多语言泛化和自定义输入提取方面的不足，并评估了不同模型在这些数据集上的表现。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为奖励偏移推测采样（SSS）的算法，通过让草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变，从而在测试时对齐中实现更高的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的研究越来越关注测试时对齐，其中在推理期间分配额外的计算以增强LLM的安全性和推理能力。然而，这些测试时对齐技术通常会带来巨大的推理成本，限制了它们的实际应用。

Method: 我们引入了奖励偏移推测采样（SSS）算法，其中草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖金标记分布，理论上展示了对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移可以被利用来恢复RLHF最优解，而无需实际获得它。

Result: 我们的算法在测试时弱到强对齐实验中实现了显著降低的推理成本下的优越黄金奖励分数。

Conclusion: 我们的算法在测试时弱到强对齐实验中实现了显著降低的推理成本下的优越黄金奖励分数，从而验证了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall 是一种三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案、过滤候选匹配和结构化验证来提高召回准确性，已在多个基准测试中得到验证并取得显著成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的召回指标通常依赖于词汇重叠，导致在未证实的实体和改写答案上出现错误，而使用长整体提示的 LLM-as-a-Judge 方法虽然能捕捉更广泛的语义，但缺乏结构化验证时容易出现不一致和幻觉。因此需要一种更准确的召回评估方法。

Method: LongRecall 是一个三阶段的召回评估框架，包括将答案分解为自包含的事实、通过词法和语义过滤逐步缩小可能的候选匹配，以及通过结构化蕴含检查验证对齐性。

Result: LongRecall 在三个具有挑战性的长文本 QA 基准测试中进行了评估，使用了人工标注和基于 LLM 的裁判，结果显示其在召回准确性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall 是一种通用的三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案为自包含的事实、通过词法和语义过滤逐步缩小可能的候选匹配，并通过结构化蕴含检查验证其对齐性，从而减少假阳性与假阴性，同时适应多样的表达方式和上下文变化，为系统化的召回评估提供基础构建模块。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过结合LLM和组合推理来解决结构化预测中的问题，并展示了结构化学习在LLM时代的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在结构化预测方面存在幻觉和复杂推理问题，需要结合推理方法以提高结构一致性。

Method: 通过将LLM与组合推理结合，探索有效的提示策略来估计LLM置信度值，并使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调。

Result: 无论采用哪种提示策略，结合符号推理的预测都更加一致和准确；使用结构化预测目标的校准和微调提高了挑战性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 结构化学习在LLM时代仍然有价值，通过结合LLM和组合推理可以提高预测的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的、领域无关的管道，用于从Common Crawl中提取科学内容，构建了大规模、高质量的数学语料库Nemotron-CC-Math，该语料库在数学、代码和一般推理方面取得了显著提升，并设定了开放数学预训练语料库的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学相关数据集由于提取启发式方法的脆弱性、丢失的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠地保留数学结构而质量下降。因此，需要一种更可靠的方法来提取科学内容，以提高大型语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的、领域无关的管道，用于从Common Crawl中提取科学内容。该管道利用布局感知渲染和基于LLM的清理阶段，以恢复各种格式中的数学内容，并保留方程和代码块的结构完整性。

Result: 本文收集了两个大规模、高质量的数学语料库：Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) 和 Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens)。Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ 超过了所有先前的开放数学数据集，并且包含的token数量是之前最高质量的FineMath-4+的5.5倍。使用该语料库预训练的Nemotron-T 8B模型在MATH和MBPP+上取得了+4.8到+12.6的增益，并在MMLU和MMLU-Stem上提高了通用领域的性能。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了Nemotron-CC-Math数据集，该数据集通过一种新的、领域无关的管道从Common Crawl中构建，能够可靠地提取科学内容，包括数学。该数据集在数学、代码和一般推理方面取得了显著的提升，并设定了开放数学预训练语料库的新基准。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出带有错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大型语言模型（LLMs）由于幻觉常常生成误导性的答案。

Method: 我们将问题转化为事实验证，并提出一种利用外部证据来减轻幻觉的方法。

Result: 实验表明，(1) 结合检索到的证据是有益的，(2) 生成和验证原子假设带来了更大的改进，并提供了可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 生成和验证原子假设可以带来更大的改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MMDR-Bench数据集和CoLVLM Agent框架，用于提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂多轮对话中的推理和指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理需要深度推理、持续上下文理解和多步骤指令遵循的复杂、多轮和视觉基础任务时仍面临重大挑战，现有基准测试无法捕捉现实世界多模态交互的动态性和复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种名为CoLVLM Agent的综合框架，通过迭代的“记忆-感知-规划-执行”循环，增强了现有的LVLMs，无需对底层模型进行大规模再训练。

Result: 在MMDR-Bench上的广泛实验表明，CoLVLM Agent始终表现出色，平均人类评估得分为4.03，明显超越最先进的商业模型如GPT-4o（3.92）和Gemini 1.5 Pro（3.85）。

Conclusion: 该框架在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现出显著优势，并在长时间对话轮次中保持了稳健的性能，验证了其模块化设计和迭代方法在复杂多模态交互中的有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语义感知的分词框架SemToken，通过减少标记冗余和提高计算效率来优化分词和计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分词方法如Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)或WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的潜在语义结构，导致语义冗余跨度的过度分词和上下文连贯性的未充分利用，特别是在长上下文场景中。

Method: 我们提出了SemToken，这是一种语义感知的分词框架，通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，并进行局部语义聚类以合并语义等价的标记。然后，它根据语义密度分配异构的标记粒度，允许在内容丰富的区域进行更细粒度的分词，在重复或低熵区域进行更粗略的压缩。

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了多达2.4倍的标记数减少和1.9倍的速度提升，同时对困惑度和下游准确性几乎没有或没有降级。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，语义结构为优化大型语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新轴线。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专门针对金融领域的过程奖励模型（Fin-PRM），通过结合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，实现了对金融任务中中间推理步骤的细粒度评估，并在多个金融推理基准测试中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRMs主要在通用或STEM领域进行训练，在金融等特定领域中表现不足，因为金融推理更加结构化、符号化，并且对事实和监管正确性敏感。

Method: Fin-PRM是一种领域专门化、轨迹感知的奖励模型，用于评估金融任务中的中间推理步骤。它结合了步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，以实现与金融逻辑一致的细粒度推理痕迹评估。

Result: Fin-PRM在金融推理基准测试（如CFLUE和FinQA）中表现出色，优于通用PRMs和强大的领域基线。使用Fin-PRM训练的下游模型在监督学习、强化学习和测试时性能方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Fin-PRM在金融推理基准测试中表现出色，表明领域专用的奖励建模对于将大型语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK 是一种训练无关的KV缓存压缩方法，通过通道级别的非结构化稀疏性修剪来减少存储需求，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法通常忽略了特征维度上的细粒度重要性变化，这限制了它们在效率和模型准确性之间的有效平衡。

Method: SPARK 通过在通道级别对KV进行非结构化稀疏性修剪，并在注意力分数计算期间动态恢复修剪的条目来解决KV缓存瓶颈问题。

Result: SPARK 在相同内存预算下能够处理更长的序列，并且在相同长度的序列上不仅保持或提高了模型准确性，还比基于驱逐的方法减少了超过30%的KV缓存存储。即使在80%的激进修剪比例下，SPARK 的性能退化也小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK 是一种有效的训练无关方法，可以减少KV缓存的存储需求，同时保持模型的准确性。它与现有的KV压缩和量化技术正交，可以集成以实现进一步加速。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Selct2Know (S2K) 的框架，旨在通过内部-外部知识自我选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识，从而提高大型语言模型在特定领域任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在特定领域场景中表现不佳的问题，以及检索增强生成（RAG）和持续预训练方法的局限性。

Method: 提出Selct2Know (S2K)，一种通过内部-外部知识自我选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识的成本效益框架。还引入了结构化推理数据生成管道，并集成了GRPO以增强推理能力。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融问答基准测试中，S2K的表现优于现有方法，并且以显著更低的成本匹配领域预训练的LLM。

Conclusion: S2K consistently outperforms existing methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: SEER是一种自引导方法，通过从不断更新的经验池中进行细粒度、逐步检索来提高大语言模型在多步骤工具使用任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法依赖于手动设计的任务特定示例或从精心整理的库中检索，这需要大量专家努力，并且随着工具多样性和任务难度的增加，提示工程变得越来越复杂和低效。

Method: SEER是一种自引导方法，通过从不断更新的经验池中进行细粒度、逐步检索来解决多步骤工具使用中的问题。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升了6.1%，在困难问题上提升了4.7%。在τ-bench测试中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型，SEER分别实现了7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER通过从不断更新的经验池中进行细粒度的逐步检索，提高了模型性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著的准确率提升。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了检查表在自动评估生成任务中的作用，发现选择性使用检查表在某些情况下能提高评估性能，但也揭示了人类评估可能存在的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估生成任务面临挑战，因为标准模糊。虽然自动检查表生成是一个有前途的方法，但其有用性仍需探索。

Method: 我们研究了检查表是否应用于所有问题或选择性使用，使用六种方法生成检查表，并在八种模型大小上评估其有效性，同时识别与人类评估相关的检查表项。

Result: 在成对比较和直接评分任务的实验中，我们发现选择性使用检查表在成对设置中往往会提高评估性能，而在直接评分中的好处不太一致。分析还显示，即使与人类评分相关性较低的检查表项也反映了人工编写的标准，这表明人类评估可能存在不一致之处。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了需要更明确地定义客观评估标准，以指导人类和自动评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一种新的动态词汇选择框架，能够在减少内存使用的同时保持任务性能，优于现有的静态词汇剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态词汇剪枝方法在减少内存使用时存在信息丢失和灵活性不足的问题，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: VocabTailor是一种新的解耦动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入并采用混合静态-动态词汇选择策略来应对内存限制。

Result: VocabTailor在多种下游任务中实现了高达99%的内存使用减少，且任务性能几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: VocabTailor能够显著减少小语言模型中与词汇相关的内存使用，同时保持任务性能几乎不变，优于现有的静态词汇剪枝方法。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了WangchanThaiInstruct，一个用于评估和指令调优的泰语数据集，旨在解决低资源语言中大型语言模型性能不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试通常依赖于翻译，而忽略了实际应用中所需的文化和领域特定的细微差别。

Method: 我们提出了WangchanThaiInstruct，这是一个由人类撰写的泰语数据集，用于评估和指令调优，涵盖了四个专业领域和七种任务类型。通过多阶段的质量控制过程，包括标注者、领域专家和人工智能研究人员，创建了该数据集。

Result: 在领域内和领域外的基准测试中，微调WangchanThaiInstruct的模型表现优于使用翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在低资源、语言多样化的环境中，需要基于文化和专业背景的指令数据来改进大型语言模型的对齐。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM)的新方法，用于生成高质量、自然的代码切换样本，并构建了一个名为Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS)的多语言代码切换语料库，以促进自动语音识别和语音到文本翻译技术的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码切换在现实世界的对话中很常见，对多语言语音技术构成了重大挑战。然而，能够处理这一现象的系统仍缺乏研究，主要是由于合适数据集的稀缺。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM)的新流程，用于生成高质量、自然的代码切换样本而不改变句子语义。我们的方法利用了一种称为Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS)的算法，通过替换选定的单词及其词性来生成代码切换语音。

Result: 实验结果表明，CS-FLEURS在客观和主观指标上均表现出色，与现有数据集相当。

Conclusion: 我们期望我们的方法能推进代码切换语音技术并实现更具包容性的多语言系统。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Motivation: 目前缺乏对模拟职业（SP）中的大型语言模型（LLMs）进行全面的心理学和伦理评估。

Method: 本文引入了EMNLP框架，用于人格分析、道德发展阶段测量和软提示注入下的伦理风险评估。该框架扩展了现有的量表，并构建了88个特定于教师的道德困境，使专业导向的比较与人类教师进行对比。

Result: 实验显示，教师角色的LLMs表现出更加理想化和极化的个性，擅长抽象道德推理，但在情感复杂的情况下表现不佳。具有更强推理能力的模型更容易受到有害提示注入的影响，揭示了能力和安全之间的悖论。

Conclusion: 本文提出了第一个基准测试，用于评估教师角色大型语言模型在教育人工智能中的伦理和心理对齐情况。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了CARE方法，用于解决RAG中的上下文-记忆冲突问题，通过上下文评估器和基础LLM的结合，显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当检索到的上下文与LLM的参数知识相矛盾时，通常无法解决错误的外部上下文与正确的参数知识之间的冲突，即上下文-记忆冲突。

Method: CARE由一个上下文评估器和一个基础LLM组成。上下文评估器从原始上下文标记中编码紧凑的记忆标记嵌入，并通过基于事实/对抗性软提示训练以辨别不可靠的上下文并捕捉指导信号，以引导推理向更可靠的知识源。

Result: CARE在问答和事实核查基准测试中平均性能提升了5.0%，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突。

Conclusion: CARE有效地缓解了上下文-记忆冲突，为可信和适应性的RAG系统提供了有希望的方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动挖掘时间常识对于创建稳健的语言模型至关重要，因为即使先进的大型语言模型在生成需要时间常识推理的文本时也存在困难。

Method: 提出了一种时间常识提取管道，利用LLM自动挖掘时间常识，并用于构建TComQA数据集。

Result: TComQA通过众包验证，并在提取时间常识方面实现了超过80%的精度。

Conclusion: 模型在TComQA上训练后，在时间问答任务上表现优于在现有数据集上微调的LLM。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯音素表示，这促使我们开发了CUPE模型。

Method: CUPE模型通过分析短而固定的窗口来捕获关键的音素特征，从而实现了轻量级模型的设计。

Result: CUPE模型在跨语言任务中表现出色，即使参数比当前方法更少，也能实现竞争性的跨语言性能。

Conclusion: CUPE模型通过在语音长度窗口内建模基本的声学模式，证明了通过这种方式可以实现有效的通用语音处理。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的KG评估方法EDAS，它能够综合考虑多个数据集和指标，为KGC模型提供一个统一的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标（如MRR、MR、Hit@k）在不同数据集和指标之间难以进行公平比较，导致模型选择困难。需要一种统一的元指标来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于平均解距离的KG评估方法（EDAS），该方法将模型在多个数据集和不同评估标准下的表现综合成一个归一化的分数（M_i ∈ [0,1]）。

Result: 在基准数据集如FB15k-237和WN18RR上的实验结果表明，EDAS能够有效整合多指标、多数据集的表现，提供一个一致且稳健的评估框架。

Conclusion: EDAS有效地将多指标、多数据集的表现整合到一个统一的排名中，提供了一个一致、稳健且可推广的评估框架，用于评估KGC模型。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于置信度调制的推测解码信息理论框架，以提高大型语言模型在不同不确定性条件下的解码效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 本文提出了一种基于熵和基于边距的不确定性度量的置信度调制推测解码框架，通过动态调整每次迭代中推测生成的标记数量来提高资源利用率并保持输出保真度。

Result: 实验结果表明，与标准的推测解码相比，该方法在机器翻译和摘要任务中实现了显著的速度提升，同时保持或提高了BLEU和ROUGE得分。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于置信度调制的推测解码的信息理论框架，该方法在不同不确定性的条件下提供了高效且稳健的解码方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [29] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了词表大小对语言模型性能的影响，发现更大的词表能降低分词文本的复杂性，从而提升模型表现，但这主要是由于常见词的优势，而不是词表本身的扩大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管近年来倾向于使用越来越大的词表，但其优势的来源尚不明确。本文旨在探讨词表大小对语言模型性能的影响，并揭示其中的机制。

Method: 本文进行了一项受控研究，将语言模型的词表规模从24K扩展到196K，同时保持数据、计算和优化不变。此外，还通过词级损失分解分析了词表大小对交叉熵的影响，并对输入和输出嵌入范数进行了约束以减轻词频不平衡的影响。

Result: 结果表明，更大的词表降低了分词文本的复杂性，主要通过减少前2,500个最常见词的不确定性来降低交叉熵，而罕见词的损失则上升。此外，固定词表大小扩大模型参数也能获得类似的常见词优势。

Conclusion: 本文重新诠释了'更大的词表有助于语言模型'这一观点，将其视为'降低分词文本的复杂性有助于'，为分词器-模型协同设计提供了一个简单而有原则的杠杆，并澄清了支配语言模型预训练中缩放的损失动态。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to

benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究引入了MCR-BENCH，第一个专门用于评估大型音频语言模型在处理不一致音频-文本对时信息优先级的基准。研究发现这些模型在面对冲突信息时倾向于文本，导致性能下降，并提出了改进模态平衡和融合机制的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在处理音频和文本模态之间的冲突信息时表现不佳，需要一个专门的基准来评估它们在不一致音频-文本对中的信息优先级。

Method: 通过监督微调探索缓解策略，并分析模型置信度模式以揭示即使在矛盾输入下也存在的过度自信现象。

Result: 研究发现，当存在模态间的不一致时，LALMs表现出对文本输入的显著偏见，经常忽略音频证据，这导致音频主导任务的性能显著下降，并引发了实际应用中的可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在训练过程中改进模态平衡和更复杂的融合机制的必要性，以提高处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Method: PyTOD generates executable code to track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for error correction, employing a constrained decoding approach using a language model instead of grammar rules.

Result: PyTOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SGD benchmark and outperforms baselines in accuracy and robust user goal estimation as dialogues progress.

Conclusion: PyTOD demonstrates the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking by surpassing strong baselines in accuracy and robust user goal estimation.

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,

Result: Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations.

Conclusion: RadReason surpasses all prior offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

Result: 通过使用我们的课程，模型在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的模型高出超过10个百分点。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，只要采用更以模型为中心的难度概念，课程学习对于语言模型预训练是有益的。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HebID is the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection, showing that Hebrew-tuned LLMs perform best and providing insights into identity expression in Israeli politics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for group and identity detection are predominantly English-centric, single-label, and focus on coarse identity categories.

Method: We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection, and benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter generative LLMs.

Result: Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results (macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity expression.

Conclusion: HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in other non-English political contexts.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高扩散语言模型的性能和灵活性，引入Dream 7B作为目前最强大的开放扩散大语言模型。

Method: Dream 7B采用离散扩散建模，通过迭代去噪并行优化序列，并使用基于自回归语言模型的初始化和上下文适应性令牌级噪声重新调度等简单有效的训练技术。

Result: Dream 7B在通用、数学和编码任务中表现出色，具有任意顺序生成、填充能力以及可调节的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: Dream 7B在通用、数学和编码任务上表现优于现有的扩散语言模型，展示了优越的规划能力和推理灵活性。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 本研究通过大规模计算分析政治去合法化话语，揭示了其在不同平台和时间上的变化趋势，并展示了自动化分析的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们旨在进行首次大规模计算研究政治去合法化话语（PDD），以分析其在不同平台和时间上的变化趋势。

Method: 我们引入了一个两阶段分类管道，结合了微调的编码器模型和解码器大语言模型（LLMs）。

Result: 我们的最佳模型（DictaLM 2.0）在二元PDD检测中达到了F1分数0.74，在去合法化特征分类中达到了宏观F1分数0.67。

Conclusion: 我们的研究展示了自动化政治去合法化话语分析在理解民主话语中的可行性和价值。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Conclusion: 我们的贡献包括第一个完全自动化的基准测试流程和一个全面的安全基准。我们在自己的数据集上评估了49个先进的LLM的安全性，并进行了广泛的实验以验证我们的有效性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SDGO框架，通过利用模型自身鉴别能力提升生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型，实验表明其在模型安全性和对抗分布外攻击方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在识别有害请求方面比防御它们更有效，因此需要探索对齐模型的鉴别和生成能力。

Method: SDGO是一种强化学习框架，利用模型自身的鉴别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来增强生成安全性。

Result: SDGO在保持通用基准上的帮助性的同时，显著提高了模型的安全性，并且在分布外越狱攻击中表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: SDGO通过将LLM的鉴别和生成能力对齐，提高了模型的安全性，并在分布外（OOD）越狱攻击中表现出稳健的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化基准和评估协议，科学调查生成的进步受到阻碍。因此，我们需要一个基准来评估科学调查生成。

Method: 我们提出了一个自动化评估框架，该框架从四个维度测量生成的调查：信息覆盖范围、引用准确性、结构组织和内容质量。

Result: 我们评估了多种基于LLM的方法，发现调查生成仍然是一个高度挑战性的任务。

Conclusion: 调查生成仍然具有高度挑战性，即使对于先进的自我反思框架也是如此。这些发现突显了任务的复杂性，并强调了持续研究的必要性。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）严重影响了长上下文的理解和处理能力，尽管之前的工作试图通过修改导致其出现的架构来缓解PB，但显著的PB仍然存在。

Method: 引入了Pos2Distill框架，这是一种从有利位置向不利位置转移优势能力的位置到位置知识蒸馏框架。

Result: Pos2Distill方法实现了所有上下文位置的增强均匀性和显著性能提升，并且两个专用系统表现出强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过使用Pos2Distill方法，我们在长上下文检索和推理任务中所有上下文位置都实现了增强的均匀性和显著的性能提升。两个专用系统相互表现出强大的跨任务泛化能力，同时在各自的任务上取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波拉语作为世界上使用人数第七多的语言，由于资源有限和缺乏标注数据集，面临数字代表性不足的问题。词干提取对于低资源、高度屈折的语言如波拉语至关重要，因为它可以显著减少算法需要考虑的单词数量，从而降低算法和模型的复杂性。

Conclusion: 本文强调了开发强大波拉语词干提取器和继续该领域研究的重要性，以提高语言分析和处理。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 现有数据集在规模和设计上有限，难以系统地研究图像是否总是增强产品理解。

Method: 引入EcomMMMU数据集，并提出SUMEI方法，该方法通过预测视觉效用来战略性地利用多张图像。

Result: 分析表明，产品图像并不总是提高性能，有时甚至会降低性能。SUMEI方法被证明是有效且稳健的。

Conclusion: 分析表明，产品图像并不总是提高性能，有时甚至会降低性能。这表明MLLMs可能在利用丰富的视觉内容进行电子商务任务时遇到困难。基于这些见解，我们提出了SUMEI，这是一种数据驱动的方法，通过预测视觉效用来战略性地利用多张图像。全面的实验证明了SUMEI的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

TL;DR: Deep-DxSearch is an agentic RAG system trained with RL to improve medical diagnosis by enabling traceable retrieval-augmented reasoning, achieving higher diagnostic accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods have limited impact due to weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability.

Method: Deep-DxSearch is an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL), where the LLM acts as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment. It uses tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy to evolve the agentic RAG policy.

Result: Experiments show that Deep-DxSearch consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. It surpasses strong diagnostic baselines like GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines and demonstrating the effectiveness of the agentic RAG policy through end-to-end RL training.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TIR已被提出作为解决LLM在需要精确计算的任务中表现不佳的方法，但其在提高LLM推理能力方面的泛化效果仍不明确。此外，TIR是否改善了模型的推理行为并帮助模型思考仍有待研究。

Method: 我们引入了ReasonZoo，这是一个涵盖九种不同推理类别的全面基准，以评估TIR在各种领域的有效性。此外，我们提出了两个新的指标，Performance-Aware Cost (PAC) 和 Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC)，以评估推理效率。

Result: 我们的实证评估表明，TIR启用的模型在数学和非数学任务中始终优于非TIR模型。此外，TIR提高了推理效率，这由改进的PAC和AUC-PCC所证实，表明减少了过度思考和更流畅的推理。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了TIR的领域通用性优势及其在复杂推理任务中提升LLM能力的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型上下文协议(MCP)为工具集成提供了强大的标准化框架，但在基准测试AI代理如何有效地使用各种MCP工具解决多步骤任务方面存在显著差距。

Method: 我们提出了LiveMCP-101，这是一个包含101个精心策划的真实查询的基准测试，这些查询经过迭代LLM重写和人工审查，需要协调使用多种MCP工具，包括网络搜索、文件操作、数学推理和数据分析。此外，我们引入了一种新的评估方法，利用真实执行计划而不是原始API输出，更好地反映现实环境的演变特性。

Result: 实验表明，即使是前沿的LLM成功率也低于60%，突显了在工具编排方面的重大挑战。详细的消融和错误分析进一步揭示了不同的失败模式和令牌使用的低效率，指明了改进当前模型的具体方向。

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101设定了评估实际代理能力的严格标准，推动了通过工具使用可靠执行复杂任务的自主AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

### [56] [AmbiSQL: Interactive Ambiguity Detection and Resolution for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15276)
*Zhongjun Ding,Yin Lin,Tianjing Zeng*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AmbiSQL is an interactive system that detects query ambiguities and improves the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems by clarifying user intent through multiple-choice questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query ambiguity is a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL generation.

Method: AmbiSQL automatically detects query ambiguities and guides users through multiple-choice questions to clarify their intent. It introduces a fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy and incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous questions.

Result: AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL demonstrates significant performance gains and practical usability in addressing query ambiguities in Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

### [57] [Adversarial Attacks against Neural Ranking Models via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15283)
*Amin Bigdeli,Negar Arabzadeh,Ebrahim Bagheri,Charles L. A. Clarke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FSAP is a new black-box attack framework that uses large language models to create adversarial documents that can outperform real, accurate content in ranking. It works without needing access to the model's internal details and can be applied across different types of language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural ranking models (NRMs) are susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Previous approaches rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents, which are limited in their effectiveness and scalability. The goal is to develop a more effective and scalable method for generating adversarial documents.

Method: FSAP is a novel black-box attack framework that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-ranking adversarial documents. It formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting, requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. FSAP is instantiated in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ and FSAP-InterQ.

Result: FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate documents. These adversarial outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, indicating a realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate documents. Furthermore, these adversarial outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

### [58] [Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语义归一化框架，用于层次化叙事知识图，以减少注释噪声并提高叙事理解的连贯性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉叙述（如漫画）需要结构化的表示，以捕捉跨多个故事组织层次的事件、角色及其关系。然而，符号叙事图常常存在不一致和冗余的问题，这限制了推理和泛化的有效性。

Method: 本文介绍了一种层次化叙事知识图的语义归一化框架。基于认知上合理的叙事理解模型，我们提出了使用词汇相似性和基于嵌入的聚类来合并语义相关的动作和事件的方法。

Result: 在Manga109数据集的标注漫画故事上展示了该框架，将归一化应用于面板级、事件级和故事级图。初步评估显示，语义归一化提高了连贯性和鲁棒性，同时保持了符号透明度。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，规范化是迈向可扩展的、基于认知的图模型的关键步骤，用于多模态叙事理解。

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个中文心力衰竭语音数据库，并验证了中文在心力衰竭检测中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨中文音节是否包含与心力衰竭相关的信息，这在其他语言中已有研究。

Method: 该研究构建了第一个心力衰竭患者的中文语音数据库，并使用标准的'患者级'和个性化的'成对级'分类方法进行检测。

Result: 研究结果表明，中文在心力衰竭检测中是有效的，并且个体差异是不准确性的关键因素。

Conclusion: 该研究确认了中文在心力衰竭检测中的有效性，并提出了自适应频率滤波器用于频率重要性分析。

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes RAGAN, an attack framework that generates high-quality fake user profiles using in-context learning and other strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in data poisoning attacks against recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Generating high-quality profiles with restricted resources is challenging. Incorporating fake textual reviews can strengthen the profiles, but poor quality undermines attack effectiveness and imperceptibility.

Method: Propose to enhance the quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of multimodal foundation models. Introduce a demonstration retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the naive ICL. Propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to generate high-quality fake user profiles.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

Conclusion: RAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

### [62] [IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310)
*Hengyu An,Jinghuai Zhang,Tianyu Du,Chunyi Zhou,Qingming Li,Tao Lin,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IPIGuard的新防御任务执行范式，通过将代理的任务执行过程建模为计划工具依赖图（TDG）的遍历，以防止恶意工具调用。实验表明，IPIGuard在有效性和鲁棒性之间取得了优越的平衡，为动态环境中更安全的代理系统开发铺平了道路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors.

Method: IPIGuard models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG).

Result: Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.

Conclusion: IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，增加推理预算会导致系统性过度自信，而搜索增强生成则显著优于纯推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为问答工具部署时需要稳健的校准以避免过度自信。

Method: 我们系统地评估了推理能力和预算如何影响置信度评估的准确性，使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域。

Result: 我们的关键发现挑战了“测试时缩放”范式：尽管最近的推理LLM在评估专家置信度方面达到了48.7%的准确率，但增加推理预算会持续损害而非改善校准。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，信息获取而不是推理深度或推理预算可能是改进知识密集型任务的置信度校准的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GOOD，一种用于从开放对话中提取目标的在线方法，能够在不依赖大型离线数据集的情况下实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI代理必须在多样化的未预定义的人类目标和偏好上进行推理和行动。为了形式化这个场景，我们引入了Open-Universe Assistance Games（OU-AGs），一个代理必须在一个无限制和不断演变的目标空间中进行推理的框架。

Method: GOOD是一种数据高效、在线的方法，通过与人类的互动以自然语言形式提取目标，并推断自然语言目标的分布。它提示大型语言模型（LLM）模拟具有不同复杂意图的用户，利用其响应进行候选目标的概率推理。

Result: GOOD能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，而无需依赖大型离线数据集。在文本基础的杂货购物领域和文本操作的模拟家庭机器人环境（AI2Thor）中进行了评估，并使用合成用户资料进行了验证。

Conclusion: GOOD在文本基础的杂货购物领域和文本操作的模拟家庭机器人环境（AI2Thor）中表现出色，优于没有显式目标跟踪的基线方法。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统期刊和会议依赖人工同行评审，难以扩展且往往不愿意接受AI生成的研究内容；现有的预印本服务器（如arXiv）缺乏严格的质控机制，导致大量高质量的AI生成研究缺乏适当的传播渠道，阻碍了其推动科学进步的潜力。

Method: 我们引入了aiXiv，这是一个下一代开放获取平台，允许人类和AI科学家提交、评审和迭代改进研究提案和论文。它还提供了API和MCP接口，以实现异构人类和AI科学家的无缝集成，创建一个可扩展和可扩展的自主科学发现生态系统。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为AI科学家奠定了下一代开放获取生态系统的基础，加速了高质量AI生成研究内容的出版和传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠的数据集，大型语言模型在罕见医疗条件中的应用仍然受到阻碍。多汗症是一种影响 2-3% 人口的罕见疾病，需要更有效的诊断和护理方法。

Method: LLM4Sweat 采用三阶段流程：数据增强阶段使用前沿 LLM 从精选的开源数据生成医学上合理的合成案例；微调阶段使用开源基础模型进行微调以提供诊断、个性化治疗建议和同理心理支持；推理和专家评估阶段由临床和心理专家评估准确性和适当性，并迭代丰富数据集。

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat 是一个开源的、领域特定的 LLM 框架，旨在为多汗症提供可信和富有同理心的支持，并为其他罕见疾病提供了可推广的方法。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多记忆系统（MMS），旨在解决大型语言模型代理在处理历史数据时的挑战。通过构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，MMS能够提高回忆性能和响应质量。实验结果证明了该方法的有效性，并展示了其实际价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如MemoryBank和A-MEM存储的记忆内容质量较差，影响了回忆性能和响应质量。为了更好地构建高质量的长期记忆内容，需要设计一种更有效的记忆模块。

Method: 受认知心理学理论启发，设计了一个多记忆系统（MMS），该系统将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，并基于这些片段构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，两者一一对应。在检索阶段，MMS会根据用户查询匹配最相关的检索记忆单元，然后获得相应的上下文记忆单元作为响应阶段的上下文以增强知识。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，所提出的方法比其他三种方法更有效。消融研究验证了记忆单元的合理性，并分析了所选记忆片段数量和存储开销的鲁棒性，展示了其实际价值。

Conclusion: 实验结果证明了MMS方法的有效性，消融研究确认了记忆单元的合理性，并分析了所选记忆片段数量和存储开销的鲁棒性，展示了其实际价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

### [68] [DiagECG: An LLM-Driven Framework for Diagnostic Reasoning via Discretized ECG Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338)
*Jinning Yang,Wen Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiagECG is a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. It uses symbolic tokens derived from ECG embeddings to extend the vocabulary of large language models, enabling them to handle both ECG and natural language inputs. The model is pretrained on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task and then instruction-tuned on ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated approaches in electrocardiography struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. There is a need for a framework that can effectively process ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks.

Method: DiagECG integrates time-series and language modeling by discretizing continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs. The model is pretrained on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task and then instruction-tuned on ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation.

Result: DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks without modifying the core model. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Conclusion: DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. The integration of symbolic ECG representations into LLMs shows potential for medical reasoning.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

TL;DR: 研究发现CSG在链接预测中表现不佳，而其他结构和语义指标能更好地反映任务难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估CSG在知识图谱（KG）设置中的有效性，并寻找更可靠的指标来衡量数据集的复杂性。

Method: 通过引入结构和语义KG复杂性度量进行分析，并评估了CSG在多关系链接预测中的表现。

Result: CSG对参数敏感，且与标准性能指标如MRR和Hit@1的相关性弱或不一致。而Relation Entropy、Maximum Relation Diversity等指标与MRR和Hit@1有强逆相关性。

Conclusion: CSG的稳定性和泛化预测能力在链接预测设置中未能保持，强调了需要更稳定、可解释和任务对齐的数据集复杂性度量。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了自动化分类器中的分类错误对科学测量和统计推断的影响，并提出了一种贝叶斯方法来校准这些错误，但该方法并不完美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管许多文章报告了最受欢迎的自动化分类器的准确性和可靠性，但较少有文献探讨分类错误对测量和统计推断的下游影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文采用贝叶斯方法研究算法错误对关键科学问题的影响，并在最常用的LENA系统和一个开源替代方案（ACLEW系统的Voice Type Classifier）中进行了验证。

Result: 在LENA系统和Voice Type Classifier中，分类错误显著扭曲了估计值，例如自动化注释低估了兄弟姐妹对成人输入的负面影响达20-80%，可能导致其低于统计显著性阈值。此外，贝叶斯校准方法在恢复效应大小的无偏估计方面是有效的，但并非万无一失。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个贝叶斯方法来研究算法错误对关键科学问题的影响，包括兄弟姐妹对孩子语言体验的影响以及孩子产出与其输入之间的关联。结果表明，分类错误可以显著扭曲估计值，并且贝叶斯校准方法虽然有效但并不能提供无懈可击的解决方案。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at
