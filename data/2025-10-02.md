### [1] [Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125)
*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为直接令牌优化（DTO）的新方法，用于大型语言模型的遗忘，无需外部资源即可有效消除模型对特定训练数据的影响，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘方法依赖于辅助语言模型、保留数据集或商业AI服务，这在实践中可能不切实际，并可能引入额外的隐私风险。因此，需要一种无需外部资源的自包含遗忘方法。

Method: DTO通过直接优化令牌级别的目标来实现遗忘，分为目标令牌和非目标令牌两类，目标令牌用于优化遗忘目标，而非目标令牌用于保持模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，DTO在多个基准数据集上比最新的基线方法在遗忘质量上提高了16.8倍，同时保持了相当水平的模型实用性。

Conclusion: DTO是一种新颖的自包含的LLM遗忘方法，能够有效消除模型对遗忘数据的影响，同时保持模型的总体性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

### [2] [TAMA: Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent for Procedural Activity Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00161)
*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAMA的新框架，用于过程活动理解。TAMA通过在无训练设置中使用返回多媒体的工具来实现交错的多模态推理。实验结果表明，这种方法可以提高视觉语言模型的性能，并且消融研究支持了该框架的两个关键特征的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管过程活动助手有潜在的用例，但为这种助手定制的系统开发仍处于探索阶段。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为TAMA的新框架，即工具增强的多模态代理，用于过程活动理解。TAMA通过在无训练设置中使用返回多媒体的工具来实现交错的多模态推理。

Result: 我们的实验结果表明，我们的方法可以提高视觉语言模型的性能，特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL。此外，我们的消融研究提供了对两个特征有效性的实证支持，这两个特征是我们的框架的特征：返回多媒体的工具和代理灵活的工具选择。

Conclusion: 我们提出的框架和实验结果有助于图像思维范式在视频和多模态任务中的应用，更不用说过程活动助手的开发了。

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

*Amirhossein Abaskohi,Tianyi Chen,Miguel Muñoz-Mármol,Curtis Fox,Amrutha Varshini Ramesh,Étienne Marcotte,Xing Han Lù,Nicolas Chapados,Spandana Gella,Christopher Pal,Alexandre Drouin,Issam H. Laradji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex, open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings, with tasks generated through a synthesis pipeline and evaluated on their ability to recall insights, maintain accuracy, and produce structured reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior benchmarks focus on simple questions or web-only queries, but there is a need for a benchmark that evaluates AI agents on complex, open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings.

Method: DRBench is a benchmark that evaluates AI agents on multi-step queries requiring identifying supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base. Tasks are generated through a synthesis pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent, well-structured reports.

Result: DRBench was released with 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains, and it was demonstrated to be effective in evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source models and DR strategies.

Conclusion: DRBench can effectively evaluate AI agents on complex, open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and providing a critical path for advancement.

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

### [4] [PrimeX: A Dataset of Worldview, Opinion, and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00174)
*Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Brihi Joshi,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PrimeX数据集，该数据集包含858名美国居民的公众意见调查数据，以及他们的信念解释和世界观信息。研究结果显示，这些额外的信念信息对自然语言处理和心理学研究都有帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型的采用日益广泛，需要更好地将个体用户表示给模型。我们想了解语言模型是否可以利用个人信念系统的一些方面来实现更好的对齐。

Method: 我们开发了PrimeX数据集，该数据集包含858名美国居民的公众意见调查数据，以及受访者为何持有特定观点的书面解释和Primal World Belief调查以评估受访者的世界观。

Result: 我们提供了对数据的广泛初步分析，并展示了信念解释和世界观在个性化语言模型中的价值。

Conclusion: 我们的结果展示了PrimeX中的额外信念信息如何对自然语言处理和心理学研究社区有益，并为进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

### [5] [Personalized Reasoning: Just-In-Time Personalization and Why LLMs Fail At It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00177)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Avinandan Bose,Faeze Brahman,Simon Shaolei Du,Pang Wei Koh,Maryam Fazel,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREFDISCO evaluates personalized reasoning in LLMs by creating interactive tasks with personas and finds that current models struggle with personalization, highlighting the need for dedicated development in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs.

Method: PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences.

Result: Evaluation of 21 frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively.

Conclusion: PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical domains where personalization is critical.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

### [6] [BiasFreeBench: a Benchmark for Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00232)
*Xin Xu,Xunzhi He,Churan Zhi,Ruizhe Chen,Julian McAuley,Zexue He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了BiasFreeBench，一个实证基准，用于全面比较八种主流偏见缓解技术在两个测试场景中的表现，并引入了一个响应级度量标准，即Bias-Free Score，以衡量LLM响应的公平性、安全性和反刻板印象程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的关于大型语言模型（LLMs）偏见缓解方法的研究使用了多种基线和指标来评估去偏见性能，导致它们之间的比较不一致。此外，它们的评估主要基于LLMs在有偏和无偏上下文中的概率比较，忽略了这种评估与现实世界使用场景之间的差距，在现实世界中，用户通过阅读模型响应与LLMs互动，并期望得到公平和安全的输出，而不是LLMs的概率。为了实现去偏方法的一致评估并弥合这一差距，我们引入了BiasFreeBench。

Method: 我们引入了BiasFreeBench，这是一个实证基准，全面比较了八种主流偏见缓解技术（涵盖四种基于提示的方法和四种基于训练的方法）在两个测试场景（多选问答和开放式多轮问答）中的表现，通过重新组织现有数据集形成统一的查询-响应设置。我们进一步引入了一个响应级度量标准，即Bias-Free Score，以衡量LLM响应的公平性、安全性和反刻板印象程度。

Result: 系统地比较和分析了不同关键维度上的去偏性能：提示与训练范式、模型大小以及不同训练策略对未见过的偏见类型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们公开发布我们的基准，旨在为偏见缓解研究建立一个统一的测试平台。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

### [7] [TASER: Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00255)
*Monishwaran Maheswaran,Marco Carini,Christian Federmann,Tony Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TASER，一种利用大型推理模型进行自动翻译质量评估的度量标准。TASER在多个场景中表现出色，并提供了关于推理深度与评估质量之间关系的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化度量标准存在关键限制，即缺乏解释性和可见性。我们希望通过使用大型推理模型来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们引入了TASER（通过系统评估和推理进行翻译评估），这是一种使用大型推理模型（LRMs）进行自动翻译质量评估的度量标准。TASER利用LRMs的显式推理能力，进行系统、逐步的翻译质量评估。

Result: 我们在WMT24度量共享任务上评估了TASER，在基于参考和无参考的场景中都表现出色。在系统级评估中，TASER在基于参考和无参考设置中都达到了最高的软成对准确率，优于所有现有度量标准。在段级，TASER保持了与我们的无参考变体相当的性能，排名为所有无参考方法中的最佳度量标准。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，大型推理模型在翻译质量评估中表现出可衡量的进展，结合了改进的准确性与跨多种语言对的透明评估。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

*Xiaoyu Song,William Han,Tony Chen,Chaojing Duan,Michael A. Rosenberg,Emerson Liu,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出并验证了一个针对生成式心电图-语言模型的开源检索增强生成管道，提升了自然语言生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG在大型语言模型中广泛应用，但目前尚无针对ELM的开源实现或系统研究，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文介绍了RAG管道的设计，并进行了基线和消融研究以评估自然语言生成（NLG）性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用RAG的ELM在三个公开数据集上均优于非RAG基线，并突出了ELM设计的关键因素。

Conclusion: 本文提出了第一个针对生成式心电图-语言模型（ELM）的开源检索增强生成（RAG）管道，并通过实验验证了其有效性，同时强调了ELM设计的关键考虑因素。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种校准概率自动评分器的框架，通过分布匹配目标微调，提高了预测与目标偏好分布的一致性，并减少了位置偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前依赖其他大型语言模型作为自动化评分器的方法存在可靠性问题，因为它们训练在离散偏好标签上，无法处理主观、模糊或复杂的任务。

Method: 本文提出了两种学习方法：1) 针对密集概率标签的直接监督微调；2) 针对稀疏二元标签的强化学习方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用分布匹配目标微调自动评分器可以产生更符合目标偏好分布的口头化概率预测，同时改善校准并显著降低位置偏差。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通用框架，用于校准概率自动评分器以适应给定的偏好分布。实验结果表明，使用分布匹配目标微调自动评分器可以产生更符合目标偏好分布的口头化概率预测，同时保持客观任务上的性能。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

### [10] [Efficient Layer-wise LLM Fine-tuning for Revision Intention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00268)
*Zhexiong Liu,Diane Litman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IR-Tuning的分层参数高效微调框架，用于改进大型语言模型在文本修订分类任务中的表现。该方法通过动态选择重要层进行微调，而冻结冗余层，从而实现了快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗和在小语料库上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本生成任务中表现出色，但其在简单但重要的文本分类方面的潜力尚未得到充分探索。虽然经过指令微调的LLMs可以将分类转换为生成任务，但它们在对细微文本进行分类时往往表现不佳。此外，简单的微调LLMs进行修订分类似乎可行，但需要大量的修订注释，这在社区中非常昂贵且稀缺。

Method: 引入了一个即插即用的分层参数高效微调（PEFT）框架，即IR-Tuning，该框架基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要LLM层进行微调，而冻结冗余层。

Result: 实验结果表明，IR-Tuning在多种文本修订中优于多个分层PEFT基线，同时实现了快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗和在小修订语料库上的有效性。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning在各种文本修订中超越了多个分层PEFT基线，同时实现了快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗和在小修订语料库上的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

*Joe Barrow,Raj Patel,Misha Kharkovski,Ben Davies,Ryan Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种名为SafePassage的三步流程，用于减少信息抽取任务中的幻觉现象，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于黑盒大型语言模型（LLMs）使得信息抽取易于配置但难以信任，因此需要一种方法来确保抽取的信息是基于文档的。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为SafePassage的三步流程，包括：(1) LLM提取器生成结构化实体及其上下文，(2) 基于字符串的全局对齐器，以及(3) 评分模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，结合这三个部分可以将信息抽取任务中的幻觉现象减少高达85%，并且在标记非幻觉内容时风险最小。SafePassage流程与人类对抽取质量的判断高度一致，因此可以用于评估LLM。此外，使用少量任务特定示例微调的Transformer编码器在标记不安全段落方面表现优于LLM评分模型。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个名为SafePassage的三步流程，以减少信息抽取任务中的幻觉现象，并且结果表明该方法在评估LLM时具有很高的准确性。此外，研究还发现使用微调的Transformer编码器可以比LLM评分模型更有效地标记不安全的段落。

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

*Ruochen Li,Jun Li,Bailiang Jian,Kun Yuan,Youxiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于临床的元评估框架，以改进自动生成放射学报告的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成的放射学报告经常获得高分，但无法赢得临床医生的信任。这表明当前指标在评估生成报告的质量方面存在根本性缺陷。

Method: 我们重新思考了这些指标的设计和评估，并提出了一个基于临床的元评估框架。

Result: 我们使用一个细粒度的数据集对现有指标进行了系统评估，并揭示了它们在解释临床语义方面的局限性，例如无法区分临床上重要的错误、过度惩罚无害的变化以及在错误严重程度级别上缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 我们的框架为构建更可靠的临床评估方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决选择最佳可解释性方法的挑战，提高自动化事实核查系统的透明度。

Method: 提出了一种名为o-mega的超参数优化工具，用于自动识别语义匹配领域中最有效的可解释AI方法及其配置。

Result: 在后声明匹配管道上评估o-mega，使用了配对的社会媒体帖子和反驳声明的数据集，展示了改进的自动化事实核查系统的透明度。

Conclusion: 自动化优化解释方法可以显著提高声明匹配模型在关键应用（如虚假信息检测）中的可解释性，有助于构建更可信和透明的AI系统。

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI

*Bowen Wei,Yuan Shen Tay,Howard Liu,Jinhao Pan,Kun Luo,Ziwei Zhu,Chris Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX is a multi-agent LLM architecture that improves alert triage in SOCs by reducing false positives and enhancing investigation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst burnout.

Method: CORTEX is a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage, where specialized agents collaborate over real evidence.

Result: CORTEX reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

Conclusion: CORTEX substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem is a tokenized procedural memory that stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings, providing a scalable and modular alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on prompts in large language models is inefficient as prompts must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms for modular reuse.

Method: TokMem is a tokenized procedural memory that stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers generation.

Result: TokMem consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far fewer parameters.

Conclusion: TokMem provides a scalable and modular alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit procedural memory for large language models.

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip is a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed specifically for code LLMs. It uses a dual-stage strategy to effectively reduce context size while preserving essential information, enabling LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs, high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks.

Method: LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1) coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance.

Result: Evaluations across multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance.

Conclusion: LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications.

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大多数模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，表现出有限的泛化能力。研究强调了在现实场景中对多模态代理进行强大推理建模的必要性，为开发可靠的多模态代理提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

Motivation: 现有的端到端方法仍然依赖于文本中间件，这创造了一个根本性的瓶颈。为了克服这个问题，我们提出了MOSS-Speech，一个真正的语音到语音的大语言模型，可以直接理解并生成语音而不依赖文本指导。

Method: 我们的方法结合了基于模态的层分割架构和冻结预训练策略，保留了预训练文本LLM的推理和知识，同时增加了原生语音能力。

Result: 实验表明，我们的模型在口语问答中取得了最先进的结果，并且在语音到语音性能方面与现有的文本引导系统相当，同时仍然保持竞争力的文本性能。

Conclusion: 通过缩小文本引导和直接语音生成之间的差距，我们的工作为表达性和高效的端到端语音交互建立了一个新范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes CopyPasteLLM, a method that improves contextual faithfulness in RAG by enhancing copying degree through two-stage training and prompting methods, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of contextual faithfulness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by reducing hallucinations through high-copying responses.

Method: CopyPasteLLM is obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. Three prompting methods are designed to enhance copying degree, enabling a fully automated pipeline for training CopyPasteLLM. The Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm is proposed to elucidate its effectiveness.

Result: CopyPasteLLM achieves superior contextual faithfulness and hallucination control. It shows remarkable accuracy improvements on FaithEval, ConFiQA, and PubMedQA, with 12.2% to 24.5% gains over the best baseline.

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM achieves best performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, with significant accuracy improvements over the best baseline, while requiring only a fraction of the training samples.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for
complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated
improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We
propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,
and procedural layers, and a refined tool suite for search, code execution, and
multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework
consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance
of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of
system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and
adaptive AI assistants capable of operating across diverse domains and tasks.

Method: 我们引入了一种可扩展的管道，用于从议会录音中构建语音数据集，包括稳健的媒体检索组件和一个两阶段对齐算法。

Result: 我们从22个欧洲议会的录音中提取了超过61,000小时的对齐语音段，其中19种语言超过1,000小时，22种语言超过500小时的高质量语音数据。微调现有ASR模型后，词错误率平均减少了41.8%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法展示了其在提高语音识别模型性能方面的有效性，通过构建高质量的多语言语音数据集。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）是后训练大型语言模型的标准方法，但其泛化能力有限。本文旨在探索更有效的训练目标函数，以改善模型性能。

Method: 本文研究了一类基于概率的目标函数，并通过广泛的实验和消融研究，分析了它们在不同条件下的有效性。

Result: 在模型能力强的场景下，优先偏向的目标函数（如$-p$、$-p^{10}$等）表现优于NLL；在模型能力弱的场景下，NLL表现更好；在中间区域，没有单一目标函数占优。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和实验研究，揭示了在不同模型能力范围内，不同的概率目标函数的表现差异，并提供了适应模型能力选择目标函数的理论基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为GUI-KV的键值缓存压缩方法，该方法无需重新训练即可有效提高GUI代理的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

Method: 研究通过oracle rollouts诊断过思考问题，并引入ThinkBrake作为无需训练的解码启发式方法，监控句子边界上的概率差异以触发终止。

Result: 在BFCL基准测试中，oracle终止将平均准确率从85.8%提升至94.2%，而ThinkBrake在保持或提升准确率的同时，最多减少25%的token使用。

Conclusion: 研究发现，通过引入oracle终止机制和ThinkBrake方法，可以有效减少冗余推理，提高工具使用任务的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various
baselines.

*Yubo Xie,Chenkai Wang,Zongyang Ma,Fahui Miao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于评估大型语言模型对中文网络迷因理解能力的数据集CHIME，并发现模型在理解和解释复杂迷因方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究大型语言模型是否能够真正理解快速传播的网络迷因，特别是中文网络迷因。

Method: 本文引入了CHIME数据集，并设计了两个任务来评估大型语言模型对网络迷因的理解能力。

Result: 结果显示，尽管大型语言模型可以解释部分迷因的意义，但在文化与语言上较为复杂的迷因类型中表现较差，且难以准确提供迷因的来源。此外，在多选题任务中，模型的表现仍低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出了CHIME数据集，并展示了大型语言模型在理解网络迷因方面仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Yifan Wang,Peiming Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReSeek框架，用于训练搜索代理，使其能够自我纠正错误的搜索路径，并通过设计密集的奖励函数提高性能。实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前基于强化学习的方法通常依赖于稀疏或基于规则的奖励，这可能导致代理陷入次优或错误的推理路径而无法恢复。

Method: 提出了一种名为ReSeek的新自我纠正框架，该框架引入了自我纠正机制，使代理能够在一次会话中动态识别并从错误的搜索路径中恢复。通过调用特殊的JUDGE动作，代理可以判断信息并重新规划其搜索策略。设计了一个密集的、指导性的过程奖励函数，分解为正确性奖励和效用奖励。

Result: 代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于SOTA基线。

Conclusion: 通过实验表明，使用ReSeek训练的代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于SOTA基线。

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CoT向量，这是一种紧凑的表示形式，能够编码任务通用的多步骤推理知识。通过实验，我们观察到明显的层间不稳定性，表现为U型性能曲线，反映了LLM中的系统性三阶段推理过程。为了解决这一限制，我们提出了可学习的CoT向量，在教师-学生框架下进行优化，以提供更稳定和鲁棒的指导。广泛的评估表明，CoT向量不仅优于现有基线，而且在需要更少可训练参数的情况下，其性能可与参数高效的微调方法相媲美。此外，通过将CoT向量作为探测器，我们揭示了其有效性因潜在空间结构、信息密度、获取机制和预训练差异而变化，为多步骤推理在LLM中的功能组织提供了新的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors.

Method: We introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability, manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide more stable and robust guidance.

Result: Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: CoT Vectors not only outperform existing baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tenyidie语言是一种资源匮乏的语言，目前在自然语言处理方面的研究非常有限，特别是没有关于音节划分的研究。

Method: 本研究使用LSTM、BLSTM、BLSTM+CRF和编码器-解码器深度学习架构对创建的数据集进行了实验。

Result: 在80:10:10的数据集划分中，BLSTM模型在测试集上达到了99.21%的最高准确率。

Conclusion: 本研究创建了10,120个音节化的Tenyidie单词，并应用了深度学习技术，为Tenyidie语言的其他自然语言处理应用提供了基础。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

### [33] [MCM-DPO: Multifaceted Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization for Alt-text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00647)
*Jinlan Fu,Shenzhen Huangfu,Hao Fei,Yichong Huang,Xiaoyu Shen,Xipeng Qiu,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MCM-DPO方法，通过学习识别偏好对中的更好选项来改进alt-text生成，并构建了两个大规模高质量数据集TAlt和PAlt，实验结果表明该方法在alt-text生成任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用户注释的噪声、标准不一致以及MLLMs对上下文信息的敏感性不足，alt-text生成性能仍然有限。之前的监督微调（SFT）方法效果不佳，因为SFT依赖于准确的目标注释，而用户生成的alt-text通常存在缺陷。

Method: 提出了一种多方面跨模态直接偏好优化（MCM-DPO）方法，通过学习识别偏好对中的更好选项来改进alt-text生成，而无需精确的注释。

Result: 实验结果表明，MCM-DPO方法在alt-text生成任务中表现优于DPO和SFT，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提出的MCM-DPO方法在alt-text生成任务中始终优于DPO和SFT，建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

Motivation: 手动创建ETR内容耗时且资源密集，因此需要一种自动化方法来生成ETR内容，以确保信息的公平获取。

Method: 本文提出了一种多任务学习（MTL）方法，该方法联合训练模型进行文本摘要、文本简化和ETR生成。还探索了两种不同的策略：基于检索增强生成（RAG）的上下文学习和MTL-LoRA参数高效微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，多任务设置在所有配置中均优于单任务基线。此外，RAG策略在跨领域设置中表现出良好的泛化能力，而MTL-LoRA在领域内配置中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 本文研究表明，多任务学习设置在所有配置中都优于单任务基线，同时RAG策略在跨领域设置中表现出良好的泛化能力，而MTL-LoRA在领域内配置中表现最佳。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Motivation: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However, manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. We introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic metrics supplemented by human assessments.

Result: We introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant with European ETR guidelines. Overall results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to out-of-domain texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯基准测试涵盖了一些知识密集型任务，但缺乏专注于多步骤推理的大型阿拉伯LLMs数据集，尤其是在开放性上下文中。

Method: 引入ALARB数据集，包含13K份沙特阿拉伯商业法院案件，每个案件包括事实、法院推理、判决以及引用的法规条款。定义了多个挑战性任务，如判决预测、多步骤法律论证的推理链补全和基于案件事实的相关法规识别，并对当前的阿拉伯LLMs进行了基准测试。

Result: 通过指令微调一个12B参数模型，显著提升了其在判决预测和阿拉伯判决生成方面的性能，达到了与GPT-4o相当的水平。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集和任务对于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在阿拉伯法律领域的推理能力具有重要价值，并且通过指令微调可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REAL-MT在知识密集型任务中表现出色，但在嘈杂检索环境中可靠性尚不明确，这在实际部署中是一个常见挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一个噪声合成框架和新的评估指标，以系统地评估REAL-MT的鲁棒性。我们实例化了Qwen系列模型，并评估了它们在不同资源语言对下的表现。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下退化更严重，经常产生无意义的翻译。尽管LRMs具有增强的推理能力，但它们在错误纠正方面没有改进，甚至更容易受到噪声影响。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了当前方法的局限性，强调了需要自我验证集成机制的重要性。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注防止生成有害内容，而忽略了当最有效的路径与人类安全冲突时，代理采取有害行动的挑战。

Method: 引入了 ManagerBench 基准，用于评估 LLM 在现实、人类验证的管理场景中的决策。每个场景迫使在实用但有害的行动与安全行动之间做出选择。并提供了一个并行控制集，其中潜在伤害仅针对无生命物体，以衡量模型的实用性和其倾向于过于安全的倾向。

Result: 前沿 LLM 在处理安全与实用性的权衡时表现不佳。许多模型一致选择有害选项以推进其操作目标，而其他模型则避免伤害，但变得过于安全和无效。

Conclusion: ManagerBench 是一个具有挑战性的基准，用于评估大型语言模型在操作目标和对齐价值观激励冲突行动时做出安全选择的核心组件。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

### [40] [Erase to Improve: Erasable Reinforcement Learning for Search-Augmented LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00861)
*Ziliang Wang,Kang An,Xuhui Zheng,Faqiang Qian,Weikun Zhang,Cijun Ouyang,Jialu Cai,Yuhang Wang,Yichao Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架ERL，用于提高大语言模型在复杂多跳推理中的可靠性。实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索增强的大语言模型（LLMs）虽然表现出色，但其在复杂多跳推理中的可靠性仍然有限。这种限制源于三个基本挑战：分解错误、检索遗漏和推理错误。这些阶段中的任何一个失败都可能导致最终答案的失败。

Method: 我们提出了可擦除强化学习（ERL），这是一种将脆弱推理转化为稳健过程的新框架。ERL显式地识别故障步骤，擦除它们，并在原地重新生成推理，防止缺陷逻辑通过推理链传播。

Result: 使用ERL训练的模型（称为ESearch）在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle上取得了显著改进，3B模型实现了+8.48% EM和+11.56% F1，7B模型实现了+5.38% EM和+7.22% F1，超过了之前最先进的结果（SOTA）。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，可擦除强化学习为LLMs中的稳健多步骤推理提供了一个强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

*Loris Bergeron,Ioana Buhnila,Jérôme François,Radu State*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HalluGuard 是一种用于减少 RAG 中幻觉的小型推理模型，其性能与更大的专门模型相当，同时参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在许多自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但容易产生幻觉，这限制了它们在现实世界应用中的可信度。需要一种有效的方法来减少幻觉，提高模型的可靠性。

Method: HalluGuard 使用了一个领域无关的合成数据集，结合了合成的有根据和幻觉声明，并通过基于 Odds Ratio Preference Optimization 的偏好微调来提炼大模型的推理能力。

Result: 在 LLM-AggreFact 基准测试的 RAGTruth 子集上，HalluGuard 达到了 84.0% 的平衡准确率，与 MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) 和 Granite Guardian 3.3 (8B; 82.2%) 相当，而参数数量大约是它们的一半。在整个基准测试中，它达到了 75.7% 的 BAcc，与 GPT-4o (75.9%) 相当。

Conclusion: HalluGuard 是一种有效的减少 RAG 中幻觉的方法，其性能与更大的专门模型相当，同时参数更少。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

*Zhen Yin,Shenghua Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet is a structure-aware framework for detecting AI-generated scholarly texts. It combines section-conditioned stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning and integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting AI-generated texts and shows strong resilience under adversarial rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection approaches for AI-generated scholarly texts mainly rely on document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues, which neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often fail to generalize across disciplines and generators.

Method: Sci-SpanDet combines section-conditioned stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence. It also integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration for precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates.

Result: Extensive experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000 annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. It shows strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting AI-generated scholarly texts, showing strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintaining balanced accuracy across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines. The dataset and source code will be publicly released to ensure reproducibility and foster further research.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

*Ammar Khairi,Daniel D'souza,Marzieh Fadaee,Julia Kreutzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法FusioN，用于合成多个生成样本中的信息，以提高LLM生成的质量。与传统的Best-of-N方法相比，FusioN在多个任务和语言中表现出更好的性能，并展示了其在不同设置下的适应性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法将高质量生成视为一个选择问题，即从多样化的样本池中选择一个获胜的生成，但这种方法本质上是零和游戏，会丢弃来自池中的多样化且可能有用的信息。因此，我们探索了一种协作设置，其中所有候选人都可以为最终的获胜生成做出贡献。

Method: 我们提出了Fusion-of-N（FusioN），这是一种使用通用LLM判断器将每个样本的最有信息量的元素合成到一个最终答案中的方法。

Result: FusioN在两个设置中均优于BoN，显示出在测试时扩展和合成数据生成中的适应性和鲁棒性。此外，在FusioN的分析中，它在具有挑战性的设置下表现出意想不到的优势和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，我们应该从单一的质量度量转向接受LLM生成的多态性，以整合多样化的优势，释放潜在能力，并实现以前仅通过选择无法达到的改进。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

TL;DR: 本文分析了将'标准'美国英语问题归类为非'标准'方言变体对大型语言模型性能的影响，并发现某些特定的语法规则导致了性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于以前的工作表明，大型语言模型在代表不足的英语方言中的性能下降，因此需要分析这种影响并寻找解决方案。

Method: 我们分析了将'标准'美国英语问题归类为非'标准'方言变体对多项选择题回答任务的影响，并研究了非'标准'英语问题中表现不佳的语法基础。

Result: 我们发现将'标准'美国英语问题归类为非'标准'方言变体会导致多项选择题回答任务的准确率最多下降20%。此外，我们发现某些特定的语法规则（存在性“it”、零系动词和“y'all”）可以解释大多数观察到的性能下降。

Conclusion: 我们呼吁未来的研究工作专注于针对个别高影响语法结构的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语法引导的扩散语言模型，通过结合结构监督和个人化条件来提高文本质量、多样性和可控性。实验结果表明，该方法在多个任务中表现出色，具有良好的流畅性、多样性和风格保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成类似人类的文本方面取得了革命性的进展，但它们的输出往往过于通用，缺乏结构多样性，这限制了个性化表达。最近扩散模型的进展为超越自回归范式的语言生成局限提供了新的机会。

Method: 我们提出了一种语法引导的扩散语言模型，该模型结合了结构监督和个人化条件，以提高文本质量、多样性和可控性。我们引入了一个级联框架，在条件文本生成之前生成语法指导，并进一步将其推广到一种新的非级联架构，以更好地对齐结构和内容。通过在生成过程中整合语法信息，所提出的模型更好地捕捉了风格化句子构造的词汇和结构特征。

Result: 在多个任务上的广泛实验表明，我们的方法在流畅性、多样性和风格保真度方面具有优越性。进一步的定性分析突显了其在学习个性化模式方面的可解释性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在流畅性、多样性以及风格保真度方面都优于现有方法。进一步的定性分析突显了其在学习个性化模式方面的可解释性和灵活性。

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Conclusion: 本文通过综述模型组件和抽象的概念描述，揭示了对模型进行更严格、因果评估的需求，并为未来研究提供了路线图。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

Conclusion: 研究展示了混合方法在DST中的有效性，为更定制化、适应性和拟人化的对话AI系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲低资源语言在语音识别领域严重不足，这阻碍了该大陆的数字包容性，因此需要系统地回顾相关研究以探索数据集、模型、训练方法、评估技术及挑战。

Result: 筛选出71篇记录，共涉及111种语言的74个数据集，总计约11,206小时语音。不到15%的研究提供了可重复材料，数据集许可不明确。自监督和迁移学习技术前景良好，但受限于预训练数据有限、方言覆盖不足和资源可用性问题。大多数研究使用WER，很少使用CER或DER等语言学信息评分。

Conclusion: 现有的ASR系统证据不一致，受到数据集可用性、注释质量、许可不确定性以及有限的基准测试等问题的阻碍。然而，社区驱动的倡议和方法论的进步表明了一条改进的路径。

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs不能可靠地识别其参数知识边界，并且常常对边界外的问题产生幻觉答案。相比之下，人类能认识到自己的局限性，并可以寻求外部帮助或回避这些问题。

Method: MASH使用强化学习，通过按次搜索奖励来实现这一想法。

Result: MASH在三个知识密集型QA数据集上进行了实验，结果表明MASH显著提高了先前高效搜索方法的择优求助性能；在多跳数据集上，MASH将答案准确性提高了7.6%。此外，MASH展示了强大的现成回避能力——它可以区分无法回答/可以回答的问题，并选择性地为可以回答的问题生成响应。

Conclusion: MASH训练有效地将搜索工具使用与参数知识对齐，可以成功用于做出回避决策。

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了针对语音语言模型的音频后门攻击，并提出了一种基于微调的防御方法以减轻威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型和多模态扩展的流行，需要研究其潜在的安全漏洞，特别是音频后门攻击的影响。

Method: 本文进行了第一个系统研究，研究了针对语音语言模型的音频后门攻击，并通过组件分析来识别管道中最易受攻击的阶段。

Result: 攻击在四个语音编码器和三个数据集上表现出高成功率，范围从90.76%到99.41%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于微调的防御方法，以减轻受污染预训练编码器的威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SWF基准，用于评估LLM在分配任务时的集体效率和公平性，并揭示了当前LLM在社会决策中的潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了探讨LLM在分配稀缺社会资源时所遵循的原则和价值观，我们创建了一个基准测试，以评估它们在集体效率和分配公平之间的权衡能力。

Method: 我们引入了社会福利函数（SWF）基准，这是一个动态模拟环境，其中LLM充当主权分配者，将任务分配给异质社区的接受者。

Result: 我们的研究发现，模型的一般对话能力并不能很好地预测其分配技能；大多数LLM表现出强烈的功利主义倾向，优先考虑群体生产力而非严重的不平等；分配策略极易受到输出长度限制和社会影响框架的影响。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果突显了将当前LLM作为社会决策者的风险，并强调了为AI治理需要专门的基准和针对性对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

*Oussama Gabouj,Kamel Charaf,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Baldwin,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态演示方法GRAD，通过生成特定于输入的演示来提高语言模型的性能，并在资源受限环境下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法依赖于静态数据库，限制了适应性并可能导致不相关的演示。因此，需要一种动态演示方法来提高上下文支持效果。

Method: 本文提出了一个基于生成的检索对齐演示器（GRAD），该方法通过训练一个语言模型来生成特定于输入的简洁演示。

Result: 在预算限制下，GRAD在数学推理和高级STEM问题上优于强大的基线模型，展示了其在分布外（OOD）领域的强大泛化能力。此外，由小型模型生成的演示可以有效指导大型目标模型，降低训练成本同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文引入了一种可扩展的演示生成器模型，这是在资源受限环境下实现动态少样本学习范式的初步步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

*Jiayi Zhang,Simon Yu,Derek Chong,Anthony Sicilia,Michael R. Tomz,Christopher D. Manning,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了后训练对齐导致LLM多样性减少的现象，提出了一个基于数据层面的解决方案，通过一种新的提示策略提高生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们发现典型的偏好数据中的典型性偏差是导致模式崩溃的根本原因，这与之前认为算法限制是主要原因的观点不同。

Method: 我们引入了Verbalized Sampling（VS），这是一种简单的、无需训练的提示策略，以绕过模式崩溃。VS促使模型对一组响应的概率分布进行口头描述。

Result: 实验表明，VS在创造性写作、对话模拟、开放性问答和合成数据生成等方面显著提高了性能，同时没有牺牲事实准确性和安全性。对于更强大的模型，VS的效果更为明显。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了一个新的以数据为中心的观点来看待模式崩溃，并提出了一种实用的推理时修复方法，有助于释放预训练生成的多样性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

### [57] [Energy-Regularized Sequential Model Editing on Hyperspheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01172)
*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPHERE, a method that uses Hyperspherical Energy to stabilize large language models during sequential editing, improving editing capability while preserving prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to understand and mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing in large language models, as sequential editing often leads to destabilization and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: SPHERE (Sparse Projection for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing) is proposed, which uses Hyperspherical Energy (HE) to stabilize neuron weight distributions by projecting new knowledge onto a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical directions of pretrained weight matrices.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41% while preserving general model performance.

Conclusion: SPHERE offers a principled path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing by stabilizing neuron weight distributions and preserving prior knowledge while enabling sequential updates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在分析2025年6月伊朗-以色列冲突期间YouTube上的数字话语，识别涉及各方的论述立场，并探讨媒体和算法偏见如何塑造数字对话。

Method: 采用混合方法设计，结合定量和定性分析。在定量阶段，使用自然语言处理技术和机器学习模型（如BERT和XLM-RoBERTa）对评论进行分类。在定性阶段，进行了媒体背景和意识形态叙述的批判性分析，并辅以手动标注和监督训练。

Result: 研究结果揭示了亲巴勒斯坦和反美国/以色列言论的明显过度代表，而亲美国和反巴勒斯坦的立场则被边缘化。伊朗在冲突期间成为数字对话中的核心角色，表明叙事从之前的霸权框架发生了转变。同时，研究确认了算法偏见对某些言论的放大作用。

Conclusion: 研究发现，亲巴勒斯坦和反美国/以色列的言论在数字对话中占据主导地位，而亲美国和反巴勒斯坦的立场则被边缘化。伊朗在冲突期间成为数字对话中的核心角色，这表明叙事从之前的霸权框架发生了转变。此外，研究证实了算法偏见对某些言论的放大作用。

Abstract: Purpose. This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel
conflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on
YouTube. It sought to identify discursive positions regarding the actors
involved and to examine how media and algorithmic biases shape digital
conversations. Methodology. A mixed-methods design with triangulation was
adopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and
machine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments
into ten categories. In the qualitative phase, a critical analysis of media
context and ideological narratives was conducted, complemented by manual
annotation and supervised training. This strategy enabled the integration of
statistical robustness with contextual understanding. Results and conclusions.
The findings reveal a clear overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and
anti-United States/Israel discourses, while pro-United States and
anti-Palestinian positions were marginal. Iran, usually rendered invisible in
global media, emerged as a central actor in the digital conversation during the
conflict, suggesting a narrative shift away from previous hegemonic frameworks.
Likewise, the results confirm the influence of algorithmic biases in amplifying
certain discourses while limiting others. Original contributions. This work
combines computational analysis and philosophical critique for the study of
digital controversies, providing a methodological framework replicable in
geopolitical contexts. It is one of the first Spanish-language studies to map,
through artificial intelligence and critical analysis, discourses on an
international conflict on YouTube, highlighting asymmetries and narrative
disputes that are often overlooked.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效推理方法面临平衡推理质量和降低推理成本的挑战。

Method: ARS是一种无需训练的新方法，通过自适应确定性监控动态抑制冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在多个模型架构的数学推理基准测试中，ARS实现了高达53%、46.1%和57.9%的令牌、延迟和能耗减少。

Conclusion: ARS在保持或提高准确性的同时，实现了显著的效率提升。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了自动化评估AI系统回答患者健康问题的可行性，发现精心设计的自动化评估可以有效扩展AI系统的比较评估，并支持患者与临床医生的沟通。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前评估AI系统响应的黄金标准是人工专家评审，但这种方法劳动密集且缓慢，限制了可扩展性。自动化指标虽然有希望，但与人类判断的对齐度不一致，且通常依赖于上下文。

Method: 我们进行了大规模的系统研究，收集了28个AI系统的响应，并从三个维度评估了它们：(1) 回答问题，(2) 适当使用临床笔记证据，(3) 使用一般医学知识。

Result: 使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为指标的基准，自动化排名与专家评分非常接近。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，并支持患者与临床医生的沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACON is a framework for optimizing context compression in agentic tasks, reducing memory usage and improving performance of smaller LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing context length in agentic tasks poses challenges in terms of cost and efficiency. Prior work on context compression has focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications.

Method: ACON is a unified framework that optimally compresses environment observations and interaction histories into concise condensations. It uses compression guideline optimization in natural language space and distills the optimized compressor into smaller models.

Result: ACON reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while preserving task performance. It preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement.

Conclusion: ACON reduces memory usage and enhances performance of smaller LMs as long-horizon agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一种新的自动化科学发现工具，能够生成可行且基于文献的假设，并通过学习奖励模型提高其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的想法工具无法适应先前的实验结果，而生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设仍然具有挑战性。

Method: HARPA通过文献挖掘识别新兴研究趋势，探索假设设计空间，并通过定位研究差距和证明设计选择来收敛到精确的、可测试的假设。此外，HARPA学习一个基于先前实验结果的奖励模型，以评估新假设。

Result: HARPA生成的假设驱动的研究提案在大多数定性维度上与强大的基线AI研究人员表现相当，但在可行性（+0.78，p<0.05，bootstrap）和扎根度（+0.85，p<0.01，bootstrap）上取得了显著提升。当与ASD代理（CodeScientist）测试时，HARPA产生了更多的成功执行（40次中的20次）和更少的失败（40次中的16次）。此外，HARPA的奖励模型相比未训练的基线评分器实现了约28%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: 这些方法代表了AI驱动的科学发现领域的一个进步。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Expected Attention的无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法，通过预测未来查询将如何关注KV对来估计其重要性。该方法利用LLM激活的分布特性计算预期注意力分数，从而实现有效的压缩而不影响性能。我们还发布了KVPress，一个包含20多种技术的库，以帮助研究人员实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是高效大型语言模型推理的主要瓶颈。虽然基于注意力分数的KV缓存修剪显示出前景，但它面临关键的实际限制：在压缩期间无法获得未来标记的注意力分数，而且现代实现如Flash Attention不生成完整的注意力矩阵，使得过去的分数不可访问。

Method: 我们引入了Expected Attention，这是一种无需训练的压缩方法，通过预测未来查询将如何关注它们来估计KV对的重要性。我们的方法利用了LLM激活的分布特性，为每个KV对计算预期注意力分数。这些分数实现了有原则的排名和修剪KV对，对残留流的影响最小，实现了有效的压缩而不会降低性能。

Result: 我们的方法能够有效地压缩KV缓存，同时保持性能不受影响。它在填充和解码阶段都优于最先进的基线。此外，我们发布了KVPress，一个全面的库，以使研究人员能够实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法，已经包括了20多种技术。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，并在两种情况下都优于最先进的基线。我们还发布了KVPress，一个全面的库，以使研究人员能够实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法，已经包括了20多种技术。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究集中在发现特定特征的具体几何结构上，因此缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 我们引入了监督多维缩放（SMDS），这是一种模型无关的方法，可以自动发现特征流形。

Result: 我们在时间推理上应用SMDS作为案例研究，发现不同的特征形成了各种几何结构，如圆、线和聚类。SMDS揭示了这些结构的许多见解：它们一致地反映了所代表概念的属性；在模型家族和大小上是稳定的；积极支持模型中的推理；并且会根据上下文变化动态重塑。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了特征流形在语言模型中的功能角色，支持了一种基于实体的推理模型，其中语言模型编码和转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

Result: 实验结果表明，SelfOrg框架在强和弱LLM后端上都表现出色，并且在弱情况下取得了显著的提升。此外，理论分析表明，多个代理可以增加正确性的机会，并且正确的响应自然地主导信息流。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为SelfOrg的框架，该框架能够使代理在没有额外监督或训练的情况下自我组织。实验表明，该框架在强和弱LLM后端上都表现出色，并且在先前方法崩溃的弱情况下取得了显著的提升。理论分析也表明，多个代理可以增加正确性的机会，并且正确的响应自然地主导信息流。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the
potential to solve tasks that are beyond the reach of any single LLM. However,
this potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between
agents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure
between agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches
rely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,
or employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,
we introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication
on-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and
assess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of
the responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message
transmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically
updated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round.
Since the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without
additional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg
framework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account
the stochastic nature of agent responses. Experiments with both strong and weak
LLM backends demonstrate robust performance, with significant gains in the weak
regime where prior methods collapse. We also theoretically show that multiple
agents increase the chance of correctness and that the correct responses
naturally dominate the information flow.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的编码器Spiralformer，通过结合层跳过和提前退出来优化块处理，从而减少延迟。实验结果显示，该方法在保持相似计算成本和词错误率的情况下，显著降低了平均标记发射延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少延迟，我们希望通过频繁发送小块而不是稀疏的大块来提高块处理的编码延迟。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为Spiralformer的新编码器，通过结合层跳过和提前退出来优化块处理。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线相比，我们的方法在保持相似计算成本和词错误率的情况下，在Librispeech上实现了平均标记发射延迟21.6%的减少，在CSJ上实现了7.0%的减少。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在保持相似计算成本和词错误率的情况下，在Librispeech上实现了平均标记发射延迟21.6%的减少，在CSJ上实现了7.0%的减少。

Abstract: For streaming speech recognition, a Transformer-based encoder has been widely
used with block processing. Although many studies addressed improving emission
latency of transducers, little work has been explored for improving encoding
latency of the block processing. We seek to reduce latency by frequently
emitting a chunk with a small shift rather than scarce large-chunk emissions,
resulting in higher computational costs. To efficiently compute with the small
chunk shift, we propose a new encoder, Spiralformer, tailored for block
processing by combining layer dropping and early exiting. We skip layer
computation in a cyclic manner and shift the computed layer in each block
spirally, which completes computation for all the layers over the block
processing. Experimentally, we observed that our method achieved 21.6%
reduction in the averaged token emission delay in Librispeech, and 7.0% in CSJ,
compared with the baseline with similar computational cost and word error
rates.

*Divy Kala,Eshika Khandelwal,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基准ADQA，用于评估自动AD生成方法在更长的视频片段上的表现，并发现当前方法远不如人工编写的AD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动AD生成工作主要集中在几秒钟的剪辑上，并且通过与单一参考AD进行比较来评估。然而，编写AD本质上是主观的。因此，我们需要一个更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析两个独立的AD轨道，我们量化了AD编写中的主观性，并提出了ADQA基准，该基准在几分钟长的连贯视频片段上评估AD，以测试它们是否能帮助BLV用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节。

Result: 通过ADQA基准，我们展示了当前的AD生成方法远落后于人工编写的AD。

Conclusion: 我们得出结论，当前的自动AD生成方法远落后于人工编写的AD。我们提出了ADQA基准，并为未来的工作提供了若干建议，并引入了一个公开的排行榜进行基准测试。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于世界模型的视觉-语言模型（WorldLMs）在多模态任务中的表现，发现其在视觉推理任务中优于现有方法，并提出了未来研究的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着强大的视频基础模型的出现，人们开始思考它们是否可以取代传统的视觉编码器范式，以实现通用的多模态理解。然而，目前对通用多模态任务的系统性研究仍然不足。

Method: 本文将视频扩散模型重新用作生成编码器，进行单次去噪步骤，并将结果潜在空间作为视觉嵌入。这种方法被称为World-Language Models (WorldLMs)，其中最佳性能的变体称为Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)。

Result: 通过一系列视觉推理任务的整理，DyVA在空间推理能力方面表现出显著提升，并使单图像模型能够进行多帧推理。此外，WorldLM的运动一致性内部化从视频预训练中继承，使得性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 本文的研究表明，基于世界模型的视觉-语言模型（WorldLM）在视觉推理任务中表现出色，能够超越开源和专有基线，达到最先进的性能。作者希望这项研究能为新一代利用世界模型先验的VLMs铺平道路，并朝着通用视觉学习者迈进。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪离散扩散方法依赖于连续潜在空间或掩码策略，ADD框架旨在直接在独热空间中保留扩散特性，以提高性能。

Method: ADD框架通过使用浮点编码的独热类数据作为扩散输入，引入了时间步条件交叉熵损失，实现了判别式和生成式学习之间的桥梁。

Result: ADD在分类任务上优于基线，并在图像描述生成方面表现出色。

Conclusion: ADD框架在分类任务和图像描述生成方面表现出色，并通过大量消融实验验证了各个组件的性能提升。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型在生成专业教育视频方面存在限制，需要学科知识、精确的视觉结构和连贯的过渡。通过可渲染环境的操控可以更好地满足这些需求。

Method: 提出了一种以代码为中心的代理框架Code2Video，通过可执行的Python代码生成教育视频。该框架包括三个协作代理：Planner、Coder和Critic。

Result: Code2Video在多个维度上进行了评估，包括VLM-as-a-Judge审美分数、代码效率以及TeachQuiz指标，结果表明其性能优于直接代码生成，并能产生与人工制作教程相当的视频。

Conclusion: Code2Video展现出作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，在直接代码生成上实现了40%的提升，并产生了与人工制作教程相当的视频。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which naturally respect hierarchical structure. The main result proves that an n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points, highlighting how p-adic metrics better align with the discrete nature of hierarchical data. The results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships.

Method: presenting a theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces

Result: an n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points; a polynomial of degree n constructed to minimize the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through at least n + 1 points; a polynomial of degree n approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots.

Conclusion: p-adic metrics may be fundamental to properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Thoughtbubbles的变压器变体，它通过学习分叉或删除残差流，在潜在空间中原生地执行并行自适应计算。这种方法在预训练期间仅使用语言建模损失进行学习，能够在推理时进行自适应计算，并在多个基准测试中优于标准解码器语言模型和非自适应并行计算方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated, natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute.

Method: We propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams. Tokens that require a large amount of computation can form a 'bubble' of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional thinking. This behavior is learned during pretraining with only language modeling loss.

Result: Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales.

Conclusion: Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time, paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Conclusion: GDLNN在大多数图分类基准数据集上表现出高准确性，并且在解释成本较低的情况下能够提供高质量的解释。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始字典学习公式推导 SAE 的框架，并揭示了现有 SAE 的基本限制。通过引入 AbsTopK SAE，解决了稀疏性诱导正则化强制非负性的问题，提高了重建保真度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏一个从原始字典学习公式推导 SAE 的原则性框架。现有的 SAE 存在稀疏性诱导正则化强制非负性的问题，导致无法表示双向概念。

Method: 通过将稀疏编码的近端梯度法展开，引入了一个从原始字典学习公式推导 SAE 的框架。展示了单步更新可以自然恢复常见的 SAE 变体，包括 ReLU、JumpReLU 和 TopK。基于此视角，揭示了现有 SAE 的基本限制：其稀疏性诱导正则化强制非负性，阻止单个特征表示双向概念。提出了 AbsTopK SAE，这是一种从 ℓ0 稀疏约束派生的新变体，对最大幅度激活应用硬阈值处理。

Result: AbsTopK SAE 在四个 LLM 和七个探测和操控任务中进行了全面实验，结果显示其提高了重建保真度，增强了可解释性，并使单个特征能够编码对比概念。AbsTopK 的表现与差值方法相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE 提高了重建保真度，增强了可解释性，并使单个特征能够编码对比概念。值得注意的是，AbsTopK 的表现与差值方法相当甚至更好，而差值方法是一种需要为每个概念提供标记数据的监督方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

TL;DR: 我们提出了Eyes-on-Me，这是一种模块化攻击，可以分解对抗文档为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域。这种方法显著提高了RAG系统的攻击成功率，并展示了模块化组件对现代AI系统的实际威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据中毒攻击在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中扩展性较差，因为它们需要为每个目标短语进行昂贵的优化。我们提出了一种新的方法，以解决这一问题。

Method: 我们引入了Eyes-on-Me，这是一种模块化攻击，将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域。吸引器被优化以引导注意力到焦点区域。攻击者可以插入语义诱饵或恶意指令，适应新的目标几乎不需要成本。这是通过操纵一小部分我们实证确定与攻击成功高度相关的注意力头来实现的。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中（3个数据集×2个检索器×3个生成器），Eyes-on-Me将平均攻击成功率从21.9提高到57.8（+35.9点，比之前的工作高出2.6倍）。一个优化的吸引器可以转移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: 我们的研究建立了一个可扩展的RAG数据中毒范式，并表明模块化、可重用组件对现代AI系统构成了实际威胁。此外，我们还揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联，为解释性研究提供了信息。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Conclusion: 本文提出了对可解释性方法的稳定性评估的重要性，并建议在该领域常规报告稳定性指标，以促进更严谨和统计基础的可解释性科学。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

Motivation: 大型模型在包含混合质量文档的大量网络爬取数据集上进行预训练，因此数据过滤至关重要。CQF是一种流行的方法，但其效果需要进一步验证。

Method: 我们对CQF进行了深入分析，并将其与通过随机标记排列获得的合成数据进行了比较。

Result: 我们发现CQF虽然提高了下游任务性能，但并不一定提高高质量数据集上的语言建模效果。

Conclusion: 我们的结果挑战了CQF能捕捉有意义的数据质量观点。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

Method: 将GRPO重新表述为对比学习，并研究了最小的两轮配置（2-GRPO）

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，同时显著降低了计算需求和训练时间

Conclusion: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，尽管仅使用了1/8的rollouts并减少了超过70%的训练时间。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过多轮强化学习有效地训练大型语言模型代理，并提出了一个系统化的训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的框架和定义是碎片化的，缺乏对不同设计选择在任务中重要性的系统分析。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文将设计空间分为三个相互关联的支柱——环境、奖励和策略，并通过实验分析了这些因素对训练效果的影响。

Result: 通过在TextWorld、ALFWorld和SWE-Gym等环境中进行实验，本文得出了关于环境复杂度、奖励稀疏性和策略方法之间关系的结论，并提出了一种训练配方。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个系统化的训练大型语言模型代理的方法，通过多轮强化学习来改善其在具体文本领域中的表现。

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们引入了Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL)，这是一种轻量级的强化学习算法，通过使用价值模型选择中间难度的提示来微调语言模型。PCL在策略内识别中间难度提示，从而实现更高的性能或更快的速度。与基于rollout的过滤方法相比，PCL避免了昂贵的rollout，并在MATH和DeepScaleR上分别实现了12.1倍和16.9倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于通过RL对LLM进行后训练仍然对批处理和提示选择策略敏感，我们首先进行了一系列系统实验，以确定最佳的训练批次大小，并确定专注于中间难度提示的重要性。

Method: 我们引入了Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL)，这是一种轻量级的强化学习（RL）算法，它使用学习的价值模型来选择中间难度的提示，以微调语言模型。

Result: PCL通过使用一个根据当前策略同时更新的价值模型，在策略内识别当前策略的中间难度提示。PCL通过专注于产生高有效比率的提示，要么达到最高性能，要么显著减少达到可比性能所需的时间。与基于rollout的过滤方法相比，PCL避免了昂贵的rollout，并在MATH和DeepScaleR上分别实现了12.1倍和16.9倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: 我们的结果展示了一种新的方法，它在基于推理的强化学习中实现了性能和效率之间的改进权衡。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的框架，用于同时对齐大型语言模型在多个目标上，包括可验证奖励、不可验证的主观偏好和复杂的交互场景，从而提高性能并实现灵活的用户控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐大型语言模型到人类偏好是多维的，但大多数流程将异构信号简化为单一可优化目标。我们想回答同时对齐模型在各种领域所需什么，包括可验证奖励（数学准确性）、不可验证的主观偏好（人类价值观）和复杂的交互场景（多轮AI辅导对话）。

Method: 我们提出了一个统一的框架，包括：(i) 在可验证和不可验证设置中标准化过程奖励模型（PRM）训练，以更好地监督模型的思维链推理；(ii) 通过使用MAH-DPO和向量化奖励对大型语言模型进行多目标对齐，其中向量的维度对应于各种目标；(iii) 展示了这种系统如何提供细粒度的推理时用户控制。

Result: 实验表明，我们的框架在数学推理、价值对齐和多轮对话方面同时提高了多个目标的性能，同时最小化了跨目标的权衡，并实现了灵活的推理时用户控制。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在多个目标上同时提高了性能，同时最小化了跨目标的权衡，并实现了灵活的推理时用户控制。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据集在多样性、真实性和复杂性方面存在限制，特别是在多工具和多轮交互方面。

Method: 通过五个不同的模型生成广泛的工具使用查询，应用基于模型的质量过滤，然后使用三个教师模型和两种代理框架生成代理轨迹。

Result: Toucan是迄今为止最大的公开可用的工具代理数据集，包含150万个轨迹，这些轨迹是从近500个真实世界模型上下文协议（MCPs）中合成的。

Conclusion: Toucan数据集在BFCL V3基准测试中表现优于更大的闭源模型，并推动了MCP-Universe Bench的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

TL;DR: BroRL is a new approach that improves reinforcement learning by increasing the number of rollouts per example, leading to continuous performance gains and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate a complementary paradigm for scaling RL, as performance plateaus after thousands of steps with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to additional training.

Method: BroRL increases the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to exhaustively broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of training steps. The approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process.

Result: BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种计算评估框架，用于平衡自适应聊天机器人的语言同步与长期人格稳定性，并通过实验验证了不同策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应聊天机器人可以模仿用户的语言风格，从而建立亲和力和参与度，但不受约束的模仿可能会导致感觉不稳定或奉承的代理。

Method: 我们提出了一个计算评估框架，使核心设计矛盾显而易见：平衡即时语言同步与长期人格稳定性。使用8维风格向量和封闭循环的“base+delta”提示架构，我们在一个人类日志数据集上模拟和比较了明确的适应策略。

Result: 我们的分析绘制了一个清晰的帕累托前沿：有限政策在适度牺牲同步性的前提下实现了显著的稳定性提升。例如，混合（EMA+Cap）将稳定性从0.542提高到0.878（+62%），而同步性仅减少17%。

Conclusion: 我们的框架提供了一个通用的评估工具，用于风格适应；系统地消融，以确定帕累托有效政策；在多样化数据集和模型上的稳健验证；以及将政策选择与系统可维护性联系起来的新可读性指标。

Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and
engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or
sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the
core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony
against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a
closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare
explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear
Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a
modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from
0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this
trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora
(DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation
across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility,"
showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring
register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that
are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides
a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that
identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets
and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system
maintainability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的训练目标MW损失，它最大化曼-惠特尼U统计量，这在数学上等价于ROC曲线下的面积（AUC）。MW损失通过最小化分数差异的二元交叉熵来鼓励每个正负对被正确排序。实验证明，使用MW损失训练的检索器在AUC和标准检索指标上优于对比损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss, optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC.

Method: Introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC).

Result: Retrievers trained with MW loss consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval metrics.

Conclusion: MW loss is an empirically superior alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

Abstract: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents
should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss,
optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is
fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This
mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream
tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental
limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes
the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area
under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be
correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We
provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC,
better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC
curves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever
calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss
consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval
metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior
alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more
discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MILCO is an LSR architecture that maps queries and documents from different languages into a shared English lexical space via a multilingual connector. It uses a two-stage training regime and a LexEcho head to enhance robustness and achieve state-of-the-art performance in multilingual and cross-lingual LSR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to scale beyond English. Uncommon entities are often lost when projected into English.

Method: MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime that combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide representation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic collapse. A new LexEcho head is proposed to enhance robustness by augmenting the English lexical representation with a source-language view obtained through a special [ECHO] token.

Result: MILCO achieves state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic efficiency through post-hoc pruning. Notably, when using mass-based pruning to reduce document representations to only 30 active dimensions on average, MILCO 560M outperforms the similarly-sized Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

Conclusion: MILCO achieves state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic efficiency through post-hoc pruning.

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of
retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the
original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as
monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and
cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual
retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking
and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted
from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage
multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations
across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual
embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering
improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based
methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It
presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices,
and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and
linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested
for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By
situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and
multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current
capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems
that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法忽略了记忆这一关键方面，每个实例通常是从头开始处理，假设没有先前的仓库知识。而人类开发人员自然会建立长期的仓库记忆，例如关键模块的功能以及各种错误类型与其可能修复位置之间的关联。

Method: 我们通过利用仓库的提交历史来增强语言代理的记忆，引入了工具以从非参数性记忆中检索最近的历史提交和关联问题，以及通过提交模式识别代码库中积极演化的部分的功能摘要。

Result: 我们展示了增强这种记忆可以显著提高LocAgent（一种最先进的定位框架）在SWE-bench-verified和更近期的SWE-bench-live基准测试中的表现。

Conclusion: 我们的研究有助于开发能够积累和利用过去经验以进行长周期任务的代理，更接近人类开发者的专业知识。

Abstract: Code localization is a fundamental challenge in repository-level software
engineering tasks such as bug fixing. While existing methods equip language
agents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the
repository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is
typically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In
contrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as
the functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and
their likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such
memory by leveraging a repository's commit history - a rich yet underutilized
resource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that
allow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent
historical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of
actively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns. We
demonstrate that augmenting such a memory can significantly improve LocAgent, a
state-of-the-art localization framework, on both SWE-bench-verified and the
more recent SWE-bench-live benchmarks. Our research contributes towards
developing agents that can accumulate and leverage past experience for
long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating the expertise of human developers.

Motivation: 传统启发式方法难以最优整合局部和全局结构信息或适应复杂依赖关系，而量子计算提供了利用叠加进行多路径探索和干扰驱动的局部和全局图特征集成的替代方案。

Method: QSearchNet基于离散时间量子游走（DTQW）动力学和Grover幅值放大，通过量子反射和类似Oracle的相位翻转操作对齐干涉模式，以自适应地优先考虑多跳依赖关系并放大结构相关的路径。

Result: 实验表明QSearchNet在各种现实网络中表现良好，尤其在真实评估条件下处理困难的负样本时表现突出。

Conclusion: QSearchNet在多种现实网络上表现出色，特别是在处理困难的负样本时。

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in graph theory, critical
for understanding and forecasting the evolution of complex systems like social
and biological networks. While classical heuristics capture certain aspects of
graph topology, they often struggle to optimally integrate local and global
structural information or adapt to complex dependencies. Quantum computing
offers a powerful alternative by leveraging superposition for simultaneous
multi-path exploration and interference-driven integration of both local and
global graph features. In this work, we introduce QSearchNet, a
quantum-inspired framework based on Discrete-Time Quantum Walk (DTQW) dynamics
and Grover's amplitude amplification. QSearchNet simulates a topology-aware
quantum evolution to propagate amplitudes across multiple nodes simultaneously.
By aligning interference patterns through quantum reflection and oracle-like
phase-flip operation, it adaptively prioritizes multi-hop dependencies and
amplifies structurally relevant paths corresponding to potential connections.
Experiments on diverse real-world networks demonstrate competitive performance,
particularly with hard negative samples under realistic evaluation conditions.

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入WaveMind-Instruct-338k数据集，展示了模型在四个下游任务中的强大分类准确性和灵活的开放式对话能力，为神经科学和通用EEG模型的发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However,
the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG
signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural
states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective
cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover
complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight,
we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a
unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable
conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the
first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model
demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible,
open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering
valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of
general-purpose EEG models.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了音乐符号在在线社区中的产生和传播，通过音频特征和歌词分析揭示了音乐趋势和情绪变化，提出了一个整合的MIR-plus-network工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究音乐符号如何在在线社区中产生和传播，通过分析音频描述符和歌词文本，探索音乐特征和歌词词汇之间的关系及其随时间的变化。

Method: 结合基于内容的音乐分析和轻量级网络视角的歌词，构建可重复的管道，量化时间趋势、建模词汇显著性和共现，并按流派进行情绪分析。

Result: 发现能量下降而舞蹈性上升，情感在2013年达到峰值，随后下降；能量与响度高度相关，而声学性与能量和响度呈负相关；歌词中的代词中心词汇和人际称呼锚定了主流叙事；不同流派的情绪差异显著。

Conclusion: 这些模式表明主流文化对之前边缘化代码的接纳，以及商业上更倾向于轻松但节奏感强的制作，以维持集体参与而不追求最大强度。方法论上，我们贡献了一个整合的MIR-plus-network工作流程，适用于社会意识推荐或社区级扩散研究。

Abstract: This paper examines how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in
online communities by combining content-based music analysis with a lightweight
network perspective on lyrics. Using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping
songs enriched with audio descriptors (energy, danceability, loudness,
liveness, valence, acousticness, speechiness, popularity) and full lyric
transcripts, we build a reproducible pipeline that (i) quantifies temporal
trends in sonic attributes, (ii) models lexical salience and co-occurrence, and
(iii) profiles mood by genre. We find a decade-long decline in energy (79 ->
58) alongside a rise in danceability (59 -> 73); valence peaks in 2013 (63) and
dips in 2014-2016 (42) before partially recovering. Correlation analysis shows
strong coupling of energy with loudness (r = 0.74) and negative associations
for acousticness with both energy (r = -0.54) and loudness (r = -0.51);
danceability is largely orthogonal to other features (|r| < 0.20). Lyric
tokenization (>114k tokens) reveals a pronoun-centric lexicon "I/you/me/my" and
a dense co-occurrence structure in which interpersonal address anchors
mainstream narratives. Mood differs systematically by style: R&B exhibits the
highest mean valence (96), followed by K-Pop/Pop (77) and Indie/Pop (70),
whereas Latin/Reggaeton is lower (37) despite high danceability. Read through a
subcultural identity lens, these patterns suggest the mainstreaming of
previously peripheral codes and a commercial preference for relaxed yet
rhythmically engaging productions that sustain collective participation without
maximal intensity. Methodologically, we contribute an integrated
MIR-plus-network workflow spanning summary statistics, correlation structure,
lexical co-occurrence matrices, and genre-wise mood profiling that is robust to
modality sparsity and suitable for socially aware recommendation or
community-level diffusion studies.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文研究了无关音频对大型音频语言模型在文本推理任务中的影响，并发现静音和合成噪声都会导致性能下降。尽管更大的模型更具有弹性，但所有系统都存在漏洞。研究还测试了缓解策略的有效性，发现自我一致性可以提高稳定性，但需要更多的计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型（LALMs）统一了语音和文本处理，但它们在嘈杂的真实世界设置中的鲁棒性仍缺乏研究。我们需要了解无关音频对文本推理任务的影响，并寻找有效的缓解策略。

Method: 我们研究了无关音频（如静音、合成噪声和环境声音）如何影响文本推理任务，这些任务中音频是不必要的。我们测试了三种基于文本的基准，并评估了不同因素对准确性的影响。此外，我们还测试了缓解策略的有效性。

Result: 即使非信息性音频也会降低准确性和增加预测波动性；干扰的严重程度随着持续时间的增加、振幅的提高和解码温度的升高而增加。静音，通常被认为是中性的，其对输出的不稳定影响与合成噪声一样强烈。虽然更大的模型表现出更大的弹性，但所有评估的系统都存在脆弱性。

Conclusion: 我们的结果揭示了跨模态干扰是一个关键的鲁棒性挑战，并强调了在存在无关输入的情况下保持推理性能的高效融合策略的必要性。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) unify speech and text processing, but
their robustness in noisy real-world settings remains underexplored. We
investigate how irrelevant audio, such as silence, synthetic noise, and
environmental sounds, affects text reasoning tasks where audio is unnecessary.
Across three text-based benchmarks, we find that even non-informative audio
reduces accuracy and increases prediction volatility; the severity of
interference scales with longer durations, higher amplitudes, and elevated
decoding temperatures. Silence, often assumed neutral, destabilizes outputs as
strongly as synthetic noise. While larger models show greater resilience,
vulnerabilities persist across all evaluated systems. We further test
mitigation strategies and find that prompting shows limited effectiveness,
whereas self-consistency improves stability at the cost of increased
computation. Our results reveal cross-modal interference as a key robustness
challenge and highlight the need for efficient fusion strategies that preserve
reasoning performance in the presence of irrelevant inputs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型音频语言模型（LALMs）在回答问题时是否受答案选项顺序的影响，发现这种偏差会影响模型的可靠性，并提出了基于排列的策略来减轻偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的预测是否受到答案选项顺序的影响，这可能表明一种选择偏差，从而影响其可靠性。

Method: 我们通过在六个LALMs上进行广泛实验，分析了这个问题，并研究了基于排列的策略以减轻偏差。

Result: 实验表明，没有模型能免疫于这种偏差，改变答案选项的顺序可能导致性能波动高达24%，甚至改变模型排名。

Conclusion: 我们的工作是首次对LALMs中这一问题的系统研究，并希望引起对该方向进一步研究的关注。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) are often used in tasks that involve
reasoning over ordered options. An open question is whether their predictions
are influenced by the order of answer choices, which would indicate a form of
selection bias and undermine their reliability. In this paper, we identify and
analyze this problem in LALMs. We demonstrate that no model is immune to this
bias through extensive experiments on six LALMs across three widely used
benchmarks and their spoken counterparts. Shuffling the order of answer options
can cause performance fluctuations of up to 24% and even change model rankings,
raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation practices. We also
study permutation-based strategies and show that they can mitigate bias in most
cases. Our work represents the first systematic investigation of this issue in
LALMs, and we hope it raises awareness and motivates further research in this
direction.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MOS-RMBench基准，用于评估合成语音的质量，并提出了一种改进的GRM方法，以提高在具有细微MOS差异的样本上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，评估合成语音的感知质量依赖于人工主观评分，如平均意见分数（MOS），这依赖于手动注释，经常受到不一致的评分标准和较差的可重复性的困扰。本文旨在解决这些限制，提供一种更严格和可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 本文引入了MOS-RMBench，一个统一的基准，将不同的MOS数据集重新格式化为偏好比较设置，以实现跨不同数据集的严格评估。此外，还提出了MOS-aware GRM，该模型结合了基于MOS差异的奖励函数，使模型能够根据每个样本对的难度自适应地调整奖励。

Result: 实验结果表明，标量模型在整体性能上表现最强，准确率超过74%。大多数模型在合成语音上的表现比在人类语音上差。所有模型在MOS差异很小的对上都表现不佳。MOS-aware GRM显著提高了细粒度质量区分能力，并缩小了在最具挑战性案例上与标量模型的差距。

Conclusion: 本文希望这项工作能建立一个基准和方法论框架，以促进自动语音质量评估的更严格和可扩展的研究。

Abstract: Assessing the perceptual quality of synthetic speech is crucial for guiding
the development and refinement of speech generation models. However, it has
traditionally relied on human subjective ratings such as the Mean Opinion Score
(MOS), which depend on manual annotations and often suffer from inconsistent
rating standards and poor reproducibility. To address these limitations, we
introduce MOS-RMBench, a unified benchmark that reformulates diverse MOS
datasets into a preference-comparison setting, enabling rigorous evaluation
across different datasets. Building on MOS-RMBench, we systematically construct
and evaluate three paradigms for reward modeling: scalar reward models,
semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs). Our experiments
reveal three key findings: (1) scalar models achieve the strongest overall
performance, consistently exceeding 74% accuracy; (2) most models perform
considerably worse on synthetic speech than on human speech; and (3) all models
struggle on pairs with very small MOS differences. To improve performance on
these challenging pairs, we propose a MOS-aware GRM that incorporates an
MOS-difference-based reward function, enabling the model to adaptively scale
rewards according to the difficulty of each sample pair. Experimental results
show that the MOS-aware GRM significantly improves fine-grained quality
discrimination and narrows the gap with scalar models on the most challenging
cases. We hope this work will establish both a benchmark and a methodological
framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech
quality assessment.
