### [1] [Contextual Augmentation for Entity Linking using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18888)
*Daniel Vollmers,Hamada M. Zahera,Diego Moussallem,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合集成实体识别和消歧的微调模型，并利用大语言模型提升性能，在跨领域数据集上取得了最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用两个步骤的流程，分别使用实体识别和消歧模型，这可能计算密集且效果不佳。

Method: 我们提出了一种微调模型，将实体识别和消歧统一在一个框架中，并利用大语言模型丰富实体提及的上下文。

Result: 我们在基准数据集上评估了我们的方法，并与多个基线进行了比较。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在跨领域数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural
language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process
with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified
framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich
the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity
disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared
with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

### [2] [Small Language Models Offer Significant Potential for Science Community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18890)
*Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用MiniLMs进行高效、快速且经济的地学文献信息检索的方法，并展示了其在提取专家验证信息和追踪研究动态方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理中取得了进展，但存在信息偏差和计算成本的问题。因此，开发一种利用小型语言模型（MiniLMs）进行高效、快速且经济的信息检索框架是必要的。

Method: 构建了一个包含约7700万条高质量句子的语料库，并使用MiniLM进行语义搜索和句子级索引，以提取相关领域信息。此外，通过情感分析和主题聚类来跟踪地学社区结论、研究重点、进展和新兴问题的演变。

Result: MiniLM能够通过语义搜索和句子级索引从大规模地学文献中提取相关信息，并能识别专家验证的信息，特别是在定量发现方面表现优异。此外，通过情感分析和主题聚类，MiniLM可以追踪地学社区的研究动态。

Conclusion: MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction analyses, and educational purposes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

### [3] [When Models Can't Follow: Testing Instruction Adherence Across 256 LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18892)
*Richard J. Young,Brandon Gillins,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简化评估框架，用于评估大型语言模型的指令遵循能力，并通过大规模实证研究验证了该框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型广泛部署，但系统性评估其指令遵循能力仍然具有挑战性。需要新的评估方法来评估真实能力，而不是记忆性能。

Method: 本文提出了一种简化评估框架，使用二十个精心设计的提示来评估LLM在不同任务类别中的指令遵循能力。通过大规模实证研究，测试了256个经过验证的模型。

Result: 我们的研究发现了持续的失败模式，并确定了特定类型的指令带来了特别的挑战。

Conclusion: 本文贡献了一个实用的评估工具，并对当代大型语言模型（LLM）的指令遵循能力进行了最全面的实证分析之一。

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

### [4] [Transformer-Based Low-Resource Language Translation: A Study on Standard Bengali to Sylheti](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18898)
*Mangsura Kabir Oni,Tabia Tanzin Prama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了孟加拉语到Sylheti的翻译，通过微调多语言Transformer模型并将其与零样本大型语言模型进行比较。实验结果表明，微调模型明显优于LLMs，这突显了针对代表性不足语言的任务特定适应的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器翻译（MT）已从基于规则和统计的方法发展到基于Transformer架构的神经方法。尽管这些方法在高资源语言中取得了显著成果，但低资源语言如Sylheti仍缺乏探索。

Method: 通过微调多语言Transformer模型并将其与零样本大型语言模型（LLMs）进行比较，研究了孟加拉语到Sylheti的翻译。

Result: 实验结果表明，微调模型明显优于LLMs，mBART-50在翻译充分性方面表现最佳，MarianMT在字符级保真度方面表现最强。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了针对代表性不足语言的任务特定适应的重要性，并有助于实现包容性语言技术的持续努力。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

### [5] [DuoLens: A Framework for Robust Detection of Machine-Generated Multilingual Text and Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18904)
*Shriyansh Agrawal,Aidan Lau,Sanyam Shah,Ahan M R,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出通过微调小型语言模型来提高机器生成内容检测的准确性和效率，结果表明 SLMs 在二分类任务中表现优于 LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的检测器在计算成本和准确性之间存在权衡，因此需要更高效和准确的检测方法。

Method: 我们微调了 RoBERTa 和 CodeBERTa 等预训练模型，使用专门的数据集进行源代码和其他自然语言的训练，以验证 SLMs 在二分类任务中的优势。

Result: 我们的编码器在 AUROC 上达到了 0.97 到 0.99，宏 F1 分数为 0.89 到 0.94，同时将延迟降低了 8-12 倍，并将峰值 VRAM 降低了 3-5 倍。在跨生成器转移和对抗性变换下，性能保持在干净 AUROC 的 92% 以上。

Conclusion: 通过微调编码器-only 的小型语言模型，我们证明了在二分类任务中，SLMs 在准确性和效率方面都优于 LLMs。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [6] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为TM-Rephrase的模型无关框架，利用大型语言模型对社交媒体上的短文本进行重写，以提高主题建模的效果。实验结果显示，该方法能有效提升主题建模的性能，并减少主题冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交平台上的简短、非正式和嘈杂的文本常常阻碍传统主题建模的有效性，导致难以解释的不连贯或冗余主题。

Method: 本研究开发了TM-Rephrase，这是一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）在主题建模之前将原始推文重新表述为更标准和正式语言的模型无关框架。

Result: 结果表明，TM-Rephrase提高了三个衡量主题建模性能的指标（即主题连贯性、主题唯一性和主题多样性），同时减少了大多数主题建模算法的主题冗余，其中从口语到正式的策略产生了最大的性能提升，尤其是在Latent Dirichlet Allocation（LDA）算法上。

Conclusion: 本研究为增强公共卫生相关的社交媒体分析中的主题建模提供了一种模型无关的方法，具有改善健康危机中公众话语理解以及其他重要领域的广泛影响。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

### [7] [Learning from the Best, Differently: A Diversity-Driven Rethinking on Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18909)
*Hongyi He,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Mingni Tang,Yi Cheng,Jintao Wang,Wenjie Li,Peng Cheng,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ODiS的算法，用于在数据选择过程中同时保证质量和多样性。通过多维评估和主成分分析（PCA）来解相关维度，然后在每个正交维度中选择得分最高的数据，从而确保数据集的质量和多样性。实验结果表明，ODiS选择的数据具有较低的维度重叠，模型性能优于其他基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality pre-training data is crucial for large language models, where quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity.

Method: ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores, enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension, thereby ensuring both quality and diversity.

Result: Empirical results show that ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for LLMs.

Conclusion: ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for LLMs.

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis

### [8] [Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态、可逆的基于剪枝的框架，以在推理时检测上下文感知的神经元激活并应用自适应掩码来调节其影响，从而实现现实对话人工智能中的动态公平控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于剪枝的方法大多是静态的，一旦移除神经元，模型在对话或上下文变化时就失去了适应能力。因此，我们需要一种动态、可逆的剪枝方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们提出了一种动态、可逆的基于剪枝的框架，通过检测上下文感知的神经元激活并在生成过程中应用自适应掩码来调节其影响。

Result: 我们的方法在多语言单轮和多轮对话中实现了更连贯的行为，并保留了知识，同时提供了细粒度、内存感知的缓解方案。

Conclusion: 我们的方法提供了一种在推理时进行细粒度、内存感知的缓解方案，同时保留了知识，使多语言单轮和多轮对话中行为更加连贯，从而实现了现实对话人工智能中的动态公平控制。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

*Chen Chen,ZeYang Hu,Fengjiao Chen,Liya Ma,Jiaxing Liu,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的全模态基准测试MMAO-Bench，用于评估单模态和全模态理解能力，并发现全模态能力在不同模型上的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，单模态和全模态之间的相关性尚不明确，需要全面评估来推动全模态模型的智能进化。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的高质量多样性全模态基准测试，称为MultiModal All in One Benchmark (MMAO-Bench)，该基准测试有效地评估了单模态和全模态理解能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，跨模态和单模态性能之间存在组合定律，而全模态能力在弱模型上表现为瓶颈效应，在强模型上则表现出协同促进作用。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，跨模态和单模态性能之间存在组合定律，而全模态能力在弱模型上表现为瓶颈效应，在强模型上则表现出协同促进作用。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

*Jainee Patel,Chintan Bhatt,Himani Trivedi,Thanh Thi Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释且计算高效的虚假信息检测方法，利用优化的预训练语言模型（如DistilBERT）在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上虚假信息的快速传播破坏了人们的信任并阻碍了明智的决策。需要一种可解释且计算高效的虚假信息检测方法。

Method: 我们使用两步策略优化RoBERTa和DistilBERT：首先冻结主干并仅训练分类头；然后逐步解冻主干层并应用逐层学习率衰减。我们还集成了LIME和SHAP以确保透明度。

Result: DistilBERT在准确性上与RoBERTa相当，但所需的计算资源显著减少。

Conclusion: 结果表明，结合了原则性微调和可解释性的预训练语言模型可以成为可扩展、值得信赖的虚假信息检测的有效框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的、可扩展的方法来评估大型语言模型的故事生成能力，通过分析叙述中的潜在社会结构。研究结果显示，大型语言模型生成的故事倾向于紧密、积极的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在复杂任务中的创造性能力通常需要人类评估，这难以扩展。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的、可扩展的方法来评估大型语言模型的故事生成，通过分析叙述中的潜在社会结构作为有符号的字符网络。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，大型语言模型生成的故事显示出对紧密、积极关系的强烈偏见，这与之前使用人类评估的研究结果一致。

Conclusion: 我们的方法为评估当前和未来大型语言模型在创造性叙事中的局限性和倾向性提供了一个有价值的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

*Howard Yen,Ashwin Paranjape,Mengzhou Xia,Thejas Venkatesh,Jack Hessel,Danqi Chen,Yuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIM is a simple framework that improves long-horizon agentic search by separating retrieval into distinct tools and summarizing trajectories, achieving better performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to long trajectories due to context limitations.

Method: SLIM separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools and periodically summarizes the trajectory to keep context concise.

Result: SLIM achieves comparable performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than strong open-source baselines.

Conclusion: SLIM exhibits fewer hallucinations than prior systems and can inform future long-horizon agents.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

TL;DR: ProfBench is a new benchmark for evaluating large language models in professional tasks, highlighting the challenges faced by state-of-the-art models and emphasizing the importance of extended thinking in complex domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current evaluations of large language models (LLMs), which are often constrained to specific tasks like mathematics and programming. The goal is to enable more comprehensive evaluations that reflect real-world applications involving professional documents, information synthesis, and report generation.

Method: The paper introduces ProfBench, a dataset consisting of over 7000 response-criterion pairs evaluated by human-experts with professional knowledge across different domains. It also describes the development of robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing evaluation costs.

Result: The results show that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving only 65.9% overall performance. Additionally, there are notable performance differences between proprietary and open-weight models, and extended thinking plays a crucial role in handling complex, professional-domain tasks.

Conclusion: ProfBench presents significant challenges for state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models achieving only 65.9% overall performance. The study highlights performance disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and emphasizes the importance of extended thinking in tackling complex, professional-domain tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights
into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex,
professional-domain tasks. Data:

*Sophia Xiao Pu,Sitao Cheng,Xin Eric Wang,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态生成模型特定挑战数据集的框架，并构建了OVERBENCH基准，以提供对过度敏感性的动态和演变视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data contamination and diminished evaluative power.

Method: We develop a framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets, capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families.

Result: OVERBENCH encompasses 450,000 samples from 25 models, providing a dynamic and evolving perspective on oversensitivity.

Conclusion: OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于评估大型语言模型社会推理能力的数据集SCRIPTS，并发现当前模型在处理不同语言和社会文化背景下的社会推理任务时存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在人机交互中的广泛应用，它们在人际情境中的社会推理能力变得至关重要。然而，目前的模型在处理不同语言和社会文化背景下的社会推理任务时存在明显不足。

Method: 我们引入了SCRIPTS数据集，这是一个包含英语和韩语对话的数据集，来源于电影剧本，并通过母语者对人际关系进行概率关系标签标注。我们评估了九种模型在该任务上的表现。

Result: 当前的专有大型语言模型在英语数据集上的准确率约为75-80%，但在韩语数据集上的准确率下降到58-69%。此外，模型在10-25%的响应中选择了“不太可能”的关系。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了当前大型语言模型在社会推理能力上的显著局限性，强调了开发具有社会意识的语言模型的必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了两个基准，用于评估大型语言模型在心理健康支持中的表现。通过比较LLM法官和人类专家的评分，发现LLM在认知属性上表现良好，但在同理心、安全性和相关性方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理健康支持中的表现具有挑战性，因为治疗对话的情感和认知复杂性。现有的基准在规模和可靠性方面有限，通常依赖于合成或社交媒体数据，并缺乏评估自动化评判者是否可信的框架。为了满足大规模对话数据集和评判者可靠性评估的需求，我们引入了两个基准。

Method: 我们引入了两个基准，提供生成和评估的框架。MentalBench-100k合并了来自三个真实场景数据集的10,000个单回合对话，每个对话配有九个LLM生成的回复，产生100,000个回复对。MentalAlign-70k通过将四个高性能LLM法官与人类专家在70,000个评分上的七个属性进行比较来重新定义评估，这些属性分为认知支持分数（CSS）和情感共鸣分数（ARS）。我们采用情感认知一致性框架，这是一种使用组内相关系数（ICC）和置信区间来量化LLM法官和人类专家之间的一致性、一致性和偏差的统计方法。

Result: 我们的分析揭示了LLM评判者的系统性膨胀，认知属性如指导和信息性的强可靠性，同理心的精度降低，以及安全性和相关性的某些不可靠性。

Conclusion: 我们的贡献建立了可靠的大规模评估LLM在心理健康中的方法论和实证基础。我们发布了基准和代码。

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and
codes at: https://github.com/abeerbadawi/MentalBench/

### [18] [From Memorization to Generalization: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Biomedical Term-to-Identifier Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19036)
*Suswitha Pericharla,Daniel B. Hier,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型在生物医学术语规范化任务中的表现，发现微调的效果取决于标识符的流行度和词汇化程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效生物医学数据集成依赖于自动术语规范化，但大型语言模型在不同术语体系中的表现不一致。

Method: 评估了记忆（训练术语性能）和泛化（验证术语性能）在多个生物医学本体中的表现，并进行了嵌入分析。

Result: 微调Llama 3.1 8B在GO映射中显示出显著的记忆增益，而在HPO中改善有限。对于蛋白质-基因映射，泛化有所提高，但HPO和GO的微调效果微乎其微。GPT-4o在所有术语体系中表现优于Llama变体。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了一个预测框架，用于判断微调何时能增强事实回忆，以及何时由于稀疏或非词汇化标识符而失败。

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在面对知识冲突时的表现，并提出了一个用于构建和解释冲突的框架以及相应的评估方法和数据集。实验结果显示，大型LLM能够检测知识冲突，并且激活级引导可以提高引导成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在面对其参数知识与提示中的冲突信息之间的差异时的行为。基于先前的问答（QA）研究，我们将知识冲突的研究扩展到代码生成领域。

Method: 本文提出了一种领域无关的框架来构建和解释此类冲突，以及一种新的评估方法和针对代码冲突场景的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，足够大的LLM在其参数中编码了知识冲突的概念，使我们能够以高达80.65%的准确率检测知识冲突。激活级引导可以在引导成功率上比随机基线提高多达12.6%。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，足够大的LLM在其参数中编码了知识冲突的概念，使我们能够以高达80.65%的准确率检测知识冲突。基于这些见解，我们展示了激活级引导可以在引导成功率上比随机基线提高多达12.6%。然而，效果关键取决于模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

### [20] [A Graph Signal Processing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19117)
*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于光谱分析的方法来检测大型语言模型中的幻觉，通过图信号处理定义了多种诊断指标，并展示了其在检测不同类型的幻觉方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型取得令人印象深刻的结果，但区分事实推理和幻觉仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 我们提出了一个光谱分析框架，将变压器层建模为由注意力诱导的动态图，将标记嵌入作为这些图上的信号。通过图信号处理，我们定义了包括狄利克雷能量、频谱熵和高频能量比在内的诊断方法，并与计算稳定性有理论联系。

Result: 实验表明，事实陈述表现出一致的“能量山”行为，而不同的幻觉类型显示不同的特征。逻辑矛盾使光谱不稳定，语义错误保持稳定但显示连接漂移，替换幻觉显示中间扰动。使用光谱特征的简单检测器达到了88.75%的准确率，优于基于困惑度的基线（75%）。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，光谱几何可能捕捉推理模式和错误行为，潜在地为大型语言模型中的幻觉检测提供了一个框架。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过分析Transformer架构在语法变换中的计算印记，揭示了模型训练重点的影响，并展示了该框架作为诊断工具的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示不同Transformer架构在语法变换过程中留下的计算印记，并评估这些印记是否与模型的训练重点相关。

Method: 通过在注意力诱导的标记图上使用图信号处理，追踪20种语言和三种模型家族在早期窗口（第2-5层）下的代数连通性变化（Fiedler值，Δλ2）。

Result: Phi-3-Mini在早期层中表现出显著的英语特定破坏，而其他19种语言的影响较小。Qwen2.5-7B显示了小而分散的变化，LLaMA-3.2-1B表现出系统但不明显的响应。这些光谱特征与行为差异高度相关，并受目标注意力头消融的影响。

Conclusion: 研究发现，不同Transformer架构在语法变换过程中会留下可检测的计算印记，这些印记与模型的训练重点有关。此外，该框架还可以区分推理模式，表明其作为无需训练的诊断工具的实用性。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Motivation: 藏语作为亚洲主要的低资源语言之一，具有独特的语言和社会文化特征，为AI研究带来了挑战和机遇。然而，由于缺乏可访问的数据资源、标准化基准和专用工具，藏语在AI研究中受到的关注有限。

Method: 本文对藏语AI的现状进行了全面的调查，涵盖了文本和语音数据资源、自然语言处理任务、机器翻译、语音识别以及大语言模型的最新进展。

Result: 本文系统地分类了现有的数据集和工具，评估了不同任务中使用的方法，并在可能的情况下进行了性能比较。同时，还指出了持续存在的瓶颈，如数据稀疏性、正字法变化以及缺乏统一的评估指标。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为未来的藏语AI研究提供基础参考，并鼓励协作努力以建立包容和可持续的低资源语言AI生态系统。

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在编码和推理任务中的表现，我们想研究LLM是否能通过招聘评估。

Method: 我们使用最先进的LLM生成回答，并随后评估它们的表现。

Result: 我们的实证结果表明，模型生成的答案与公司参考答案之间存在显著不一致。

Conclusion: 所有评估的LLM都无法通过招聘评估。

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

TL;DR: TSSS是一种高效的多跳RAG框架，通过结构化推理和确定性终止机制提高了推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的迭代提示方法在多跳RAG中效率低下，因为它们在每一步都重新生成可预测的标记序列，并依赖于随机停止，导致过多的标记使用和不稳定的终止。

Method: TSSS引入了基于模板的推理和基于检索器的终止器，以提高多跳RAG的效率和稳定性。

Result: TSSS在多个数据集上实现了最先进的准确率，并在效率方面表现出色。

Conclusion: TSSS在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHop和MuSiQue数据集上实现了最先进的准确率，并在RAG-CoT方法中表现出色，展示了其在效率受限场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces evolveQA, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on their ability to handle temporally evolving knowledge. The results show that LLMs experience significant performance drops when dealing with dynamic knowledge, emphasizing the need for better temporal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on temporal knowledge conflicts are limited, focusing on static, widely-covered entities rather than dynamic, evolving knowledge. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing a more realistic and dynamic benchmark.

Method: The paper introduces evolveQA, a benchmark constructed from real-world, time-stamped corpora (AWS updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports) to evaluate LLMs on their ability to handle temporal knowledge conflicts. The framework identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates.

Result: Extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across three knowledge probing formats shows significant performance drops of up to 31% on evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions, demonstrating the challenges LLMs face in handling temporally evolving knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant performance drops when handling temporally evolving knowledge, highlighting the need for benchmarks like evolveQA to evaluate their temporal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Motivation: 传统问答系统通常依赖于检索增强生成（RAG）和大型语言模型（LLM），但这种方法可能效率较低或成本较高。因此，本文旨在开发一种仅依赖知识图谱检索的高效问答系统。

Method: 该方法分为两个主要阶段：第一阶段是对文档进行预处理以生成问题-答案（QA）对；第二阶段是将这些QA转换为知识图谱，并使用嵌入和模糊技术进行基于图的检索。然后查询、重新排序并重新表述图以生成最终答案。

Result: 该系统在CRAG基准测试中表现出色，使用LLAMA-3.2和GPT-3.5-Turbo分别达到了71.9%和54.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种仅依赖知识图谱检索的问答系统，无需依赖检索增强生成（RAG）和大型语言模型（LLM）。实验结果显示在CRAG基准测试中，使用LLAMA-3.2和GPT-3.5-Turbo分别达到了71.9%和54.4%的准确率。

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Motivation: 现有的评估方法无法捕捉多轮工具增强对话中的关键错误，例如当代理误解工具结果但看起来对用户满意时。

Method: 本文介绍了TRACE基准和SCOPE评估框架，用于系统地合成工具增强对话并自动发现错误模式和评估标准。

Conclusion: TRACE和SCOPE的引入为评估使用外部工具的对话AI系统提供了新的方法，实验结果表明SCOPE在具有挑战性的案例中显著优于基线。

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and

patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

*Hang Zheng,Hongshen Xu,Yongkai Lin,Shuai Fan,Lu Chen,Kai Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DiSRouter，一种从集中控制转向分布式路由的新范式。在DiSRouter中，查询通过LLM代理网络，每个代理独立决定是否回答或路由到其他代理，基于其自我意识和判断自身能力的能力。这种分布式设计提供了更高的灵活性、可扩展性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的路由系统通常依赖于一个集中式的外部路由器，在固定的一组LLM上进行训练，这使得它们不够灵活且容易表现不佳，因为小型路由器无法完全理解不同LLM的知识边界。

Method: 我们提出了一个两阶段的自我意识训练管道，以增强每个LLM的自我意识。

Result: 实验表明，DiSRouter在各种场景下的效用上显著优于现有的路由方法，能够有效地区分简单和困难的查询，并在域外任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们的工作验证了利用LLM的内在自我意识比外部评估更有效，为更模块化和高效的多智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种类型匹配的语言距离框架，通过结构感知表示和复合距离提升了多语言研究的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言知识库如URIEL+在跨语言迁移中提供了有价值的地理、遗传和类型学距离，但存在两个关键限制：它们的统一向量表示不适合语言数据的多样化结构，且缺乏将这些信号整合成单一综合分数的方法。

Method: 我们引入了一个类型匹配的语言距离框架，提出了针对每种距离类型的新型结构感知表示：用于地理的说话者加权分布，用于谱系的双曲嵌入，以及用于类型学的潜在变量模型。

Result: 我们的框架能够将不同类型的信号统一成一个稳健的任务无关的复合距离，并在多种NLP任务中提升性能。

Conclusion: 我们的表示和复合距离在选择转移语言时在各种NLP任务中 consistently 提高了性能，为多语言研究提供了更合理和有效的工具包。

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs).

Method: SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, an execution module, and a validation module.

Result: We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.

Conclusion: SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in SheetBench.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的神经问题生成方法在控制难度方面存在两个主要限制：无法直接生成选择题，且未明确训练以优化难度控制的准确性。

Result: 本文提出的方法能够生成难度可控的选择题，提高了难度控制的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的难度可控的阅读理解选择题生成方法，该方法利用经过直接偏好优化训练的大语言模型来提高难度控制的准确性。

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TheMCPCompany is a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on real-world tasks. It shows that while tool-calling agents can improve performance and reduce costs, current models still struggle with complex environments requiring navigation of tens of thousands of tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for interacting with the environment, but task-specific tool sets offer an alternative that is easier to develop and maintain than GUIs. However, there is a need for a benchmark to evaluate tool-calling agents on real-world tasks.

Method: We introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks involving interacting with various real-world services. We use REST APIs to create MCP servers with over 18,000 tools and provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task.

Result: All models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, but smaller models cannot fully utilize the available tools through retrieval. GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments but struggle with complex enterprise environments.

Conclusion: TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models.

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联合声明和查询生成框架JointCQ，用于改进幻觉检测管道中的声明提取和查询生成阶段，从而提高语言模型系统的可信度和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）常常面临幻觉问题，即生成看似真实但不可靠的内容。现有的方法在前两个阶段存在局限性，例如在声明提取过程中出现上下文丢失以及查询生成的特异性较低，导致幻觉检测管道的性能下降。

Method: 我们引入了JointCQ，这是一种联合声明和查询生成框架，旨在构建有效的声明-查询生成器。我们的框架利用精心设计的评估标准来筛选合成训练数据，并微调语言模型以进行联合声明提取和查询生成，为下游搜索和验证提供可靠且信息丰富的输入。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在多个开放域QA幻觉检测基准上优于之前的方法，推动了更可信和透明的语言模型系统的实现。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个开放域QA幻觉检测基准上优于之前的方法，推动了更可信和透明的语言模型系统的实现。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

TL;DR: KORE is a method for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge, which effectively addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often struggle to learn new knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting.

Method: KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on various LMMs show that KORE achieves superior new knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: KORE achieves superior new knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自然语言生成模型的输出可靠性问题，特别是幻觉现象，需要一种有效的检测方法。

Method: 我们引入了一个全面的幻觉分类法，并提出了HAD模型，该模型整合了幻觉检测、跨度级识别和修正。

Result: HAD模型在Halucation检测任务中表现优异，优于现有基线，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 我们的HAD模型在各种NLG任务中表现出色，且在Halucation检测方面达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为超体积优化的新方法，用于通过强化学习优化文本摘要的多目标问题。实验结果表明，该方法在整体得分和不同维度上的平衡性能方面优于现有方法，并且在摘要任务中表现与GPT-4相当，同时生成长度更短。


<details>

Motivation: 文本摘要是一项需要同时优化多个目标的任务，包括一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性，这带来了相当大的挑战。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）已经展示了出色的表现，但很少有研究专注于通过基于LLMs的强化学习优化摘要的多目标问题。

Method: 我们引入了超体积优化（HVO），这是一种新颖的优化策略，通过使用超体积方法在强化学习的奖励过程中动态调整组间的分数。这种方法引导模型的优化逐步逼近帕累托前沿，从而生成在多个目标上平衡的摘要。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在整体得分上优于GRPO，并在不同维度上表现出更平衡的性能。此外，增强HVO的7B基础模型在摘要任务中表现与GPT-4相当，同时保持较短的生成长度。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在整体得分上优于GRPO，并在不同维度上表现出更平衡的性能。此外，增强HVO的7B基础模型在摘要任务中表现与GPT-4相当，同时保持较短的生成长度。

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available

Motivation: 我们提出将推理整合到语音大型语言模型（语音LLM）中，以进行端到端的槽位填充任务。

Method: 我们使用思维链框架将槽位填充任务分解为多个推理步骤，创建了一个推理数据集，并应用了监督微调策略到语音LLM上。

Result: 我们展示了通过引入推理（中间）步骤可以提高性能。然而，我们表明主要为数学、逻辑和编码领域开发的推理文本LLM可能作为推理语音LLM的基础模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 我们展示了混合语音LLM在结合文本基础LLM并微调以保持直接和推理操作模式时表现优于仅采用一种操作模式的模型。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于微调GLiNER模型的本地部署PII移除系统LOGICAL，用于从临床笔记中移除个人身份信息。该系统在资源有限的环境中表现出色，具有高准确性和计算效率，同时保持数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从电子健康记录（EHR）的临床笔记中移除个人身份信息（PII）对于研究和AI开发至关重要。然而，大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算成本和基于API的服务的数据隐私风险限制了它们的使用，尤其是在资源有限的环境中。

Method: LOGICAL系统基于微调的GLiNER模型构建，该模型在1515份临床文档上进行了训练，并在9个PII类别上进行了评估。使用字符级精度、召回率和F1分数对模型进行了测试，并与Microsoft Azure NER、Microsoft Presidio以及零样本提示的Gemini-Pro-2.5和Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct进行了比较。

Result: 微调的GLiNER模型在测试集上取得了优越的性能，总体微平均F1得分为0.980，显著优于Gemini-Pro-2.5（F1得分：0.845）。LOGICAL正确地完全净化了95%的文档，而次优解决方案仅为64%。模型在没有专用GPU的标准笔记本电脑上高效运行。然而，2%的实体级假阴性率突显了所有测试系统都需要人工验证的必要性。

Conclusion: 微调的专用Transformer模型如GLiNER为从临床笔记中移除PII提供了一种准确、计算效率高且安全的解决方案。这种“在源头进行消毒”的方法是资源密集型LLM的实用替代方案，有助于在保持数据隐私的同时创建去标识化数据集，特别是在资源有限的环境中。

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M3-SLU is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. It highlights the challenge of speaker-attributed reasoning and provides a platform for advancing research in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, but they still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who said what and when in natural conversations.

Method: M3-SLU is built from four open corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000 validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker Attribution via Utterance Matching.

Result: Results show that while models can capture what was said, they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware dialogue understanding.

Conclusion: M3-SLU offers a challenging benchmark to advance research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for

corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

*Xianyang Liu,Yilin Liu,Shuai Wang,Hao Cheng,Andrew Estornell,Yuzhi Zhao,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AgenticMath的新代理流程，用于生成高质量的数学问题-答案对以提升大型语言模型的监督微调效果。该方法包括四个阶段：种子问题过滤、代理问题重述、答案增强以及最终的问题和答案评估。实验表明，在较小规模但高质量的数据集上微调的LLM在数学推理任务中表现优于或相当于在大规模低质量数据集上训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建高质量的数据集以提高大型语言模型（LLM）的推理仍然是一项重大挑战，因为当前的方法往往会产生低质量/错误的答案，并且从可用数据源中获取的信息丰富度有限。

Method: 我们提出了AgenticMath，这是一种新型的代理管道，用于生成高质量的数学问题-答案对以增强LLMs的监督微调。我们的方法通过四个阶段进行：(1)种子问题过滤器选择具有高信息丰富性、复杂性和清晰度的问题；(2)代理问题重述步骤使用多代理系统生成多样且逻辑一致的改写；(3)答案增强步骤使用链式思维推理重写答案以提高数值和逻辑正确性，而无需依赖人工提供的标签；(4)最终的问题和答案评估保留最优秀的对。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，在AgenticMath生成的数据集（仅包含30-60K个数学样本）上微调3B-8B参数的LLM在各种领域内和领域外的数学推理基准测试中表现与基线相当或更好，而基线是在更多数据（例如400K或2.3M样本）上训练的。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，有针对性的高质量数据生成比大规模低质量替代方案更有效地提高LLMs的数学推理能力。

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

*Siyuan Wang,Gaokai Zhang,Li Lyna Zhang,Ning Shang,Fan Yang,Dongyao Chen,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL is a data-driven RL method that enhances long-context reasoning by transforming short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty tasks, leading to significant improvements in accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models, but advanced thinking patterns for long-context reasoning remain unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data are scarce.

Method: LoongRL is a data-driven RL method for advanced long-context reasoning, with KeyChain transforming short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context tasks by inserting UUID chains.

Result: On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all 128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: LoongRL-14B reaches a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models and improves long-context retrieval and short-context reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

*Xinfeng Xia,Jiacheng Liu,Xiaofeng Hou,Peng Tang,Mingxuan Zhang,Wenfeng Wang,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoE-Prism is a model-system co-design that makes MoE models more flexible and adaptable, allowing better trade-offs between cost and quality while improving performance under various constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face a 'quality cliff' due to their reliance on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism, leading to inflexibility and significant resource over-provisioning.

Method: The paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms rigid MoE models into elastic services. It includes an Offline Refactoring Engine that deconstructs monolithic experts into fine-grained sub-experts and an Online Scheduling Engine that leverages this elasticity through QoS-aware scheduling.

Result: MoE-Prism provides over 4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9% under a strict latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36% under limited resources.

Conclusion: MoE-Prism provides the critical 'control knob' to bridge the model-system gap, enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法，利用目标句子的句子嵌入作为gloss的角色，从而无需手动注释，提高了手势语言翻译系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手势语言翻译系统依赖于gloss标注数据，但这些数据通常不可用或在不同数据集中差异很大。

Method: 使用目标句子的句子嵌入作为gloss的角色，在训练时不需要任何手动注释，而是从原始文本数据中学习。

Result: 我们的方法在德国语（PHOENIX-2014T）和美国手语（How2Sign）的数据集上进行了评估，并且实验了单语和多语句嵌入和翻译系统。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在没有gloss数据集的情况下显著优于其他gloss-free方法，减少了gloss-free和gloss-dependent系统之间的差距。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种语言无关的多模态嵌入监督方法，并结合耦合增强技术，以提高SLT的可扩展性和跨语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的SLT训练通常使用单语种文本，限制了可扩展性和跨语言泛化能力。早期方法虽然用基于文本的句子嵌入代替了术语监督，但仍然局限于特定语言和模态。

Method: 我们采用语言无关的多模态嵌入来监督SLT，这些嵌入是在来自多种语言的文本和语音上训练的，并提出了一种耦合增强方法，结合多语言目标增强和视频级扰动以提高模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，在仅文本句子嵌入监督下，BLEURT得分有持续提升，特别是在低资源设置中改善更大。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，语言无关的嵌入监督结合耦合增强提供了一种可扩展且语义稳健的传统SLT训练替代方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

TL;DR: 我们的工作展示了如何通过一个轻量级模型ToMMeR从早期的语言模型层中高效地检测提及，并实现了接近最先进的NER性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别哪些文本跨度指的是实体——提及检测——对于信息提取是基础性的，并且是一个已知的性能瓶颈。

Method: 我们引入了ToMMeR，这是一个轻量级模型（<300K参数），用于从早期LLM层中探测提及检测能力。

Result: 在13个NER基准测试中，ToMMeR实现了93%的零样本召回率，使用LLM作为裁判时超过90%的精度，这表明ToMMeR很少产生虚假预测。跨模型分析显示，不同的架构（14M-15B参数）收敛于相似的提及边界（DICE>75%），证实了提及检测自然地从语言建模中出现。当扩展带有跨度分类头时，ToMMeR实现了接近SOTA的NER性能（标准基准上的80-87% F1）。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了证据，表明结构化的实体表示存在于早期的变压器层中，并且可以使用少量参数高效地恢复。

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

Motivation: 标准方法通常无法受益于时间特征，因此我们希望改进这一点。

Method: 我们提出了一种系统，该系统在一个模型中学习时空特征表示和翻译，从而实现真正的端到端架构。

Result: 我们的最佳系统在开发集上达到了5±1 BLEU分数，但在测试集上的性能下降到0.11±0.06 BLEU分数。

Conclusion: 我们的最佳系统在开发集上达到了5±1 BLEU分数，但在测试集上的性能下降到0.11±0.06 BLEU分数。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了弥合性能导向基准与认知启发模型评估之间的差距，引入了BLiSS 1.0，以操作化一种新的选择性容忍范式。

Method: BLiSS 1.0 是通过从280万条自然学习者句子中构建的，提供了136,867个受控三元组（修正、学习者、人工）来测试模型是否能更合理地接受自然学习者错误而非匹配的人工错误。

Result: 实验表明，选择性容忍是一种不同于标准语法性的能力，性能按训练范式强烈聚集。

Conclusion: BLiSS 1.0 是一个稳健的工具，可以测量不同训练目标如何影响模型与人类语言习得系统性模式的对齐程度。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

Motivation: 现有基准受限于静态设计，无法充分评估LMMs在时间敏感知识方面的理解能力。因此，需要一个更全面的基准来评估LMMs的时间意识。

Method: 提出MINED基准，包含2,104个时间敏感知识样本，涵盖六个知识类型，并评估了15个广泛使用的LMMs的表现。同时，研究了通过知识编辑方法更新时间敏感知识的可行性。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro在MINED上取得了最高的平均CEM分数63.07，而大多数开源LMMs在时间理解方面仍有不足。LMMs在组织知识方面表现最好，但在体育方面最差。知识编辑方法在单次编辑场景中能够有效更新LMMs中的时间敏感知识。

Conclusion: MINED是一个全面的基准，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在时间敏感知识方面的时序意识。实验结果表明，Gemini-2.5-Pro在MINED上表现最佳，而大多数开源LMMs仍然缺乏时间理解能力。此外，LMMs在组织知识方面表现最好，而在体育方面最差。通过知识编辑方法可以有效更新LMMs中的时间敏感知识。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

Motivation: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to also be effective for speech-to-text tasks.

Method: We evaluate MBR decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its derivative models.

Result: The accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated.

Conclusion: MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST tasks that require high accuracy.

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality

Motivation: 尽管MIAs和机器生成文本检测的目标不同，但它们的方法通常利用相似的信号。然而，这两个任务一直被独立研究，可能导致忽略了对方任务中更强的方法和有价值的见解。因此，本文旨在研究这两个任务之间的可转移性，并推动跨任务的合作。

Method: 本文通过理论分析和大规模实验，研究了MIAs和机器生成文本检测之间的可转移性。理论部分证明了在两个任务中表现最佳的度量是相同的，而实验部分包括7种最先进的MIA方法和5种最先进的机器文本检测器，在13个领域和10个生成器上进行了测试。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果表明，MIAs和机器生成文本检测之间存在很强的可转移性，这表明两个研究领域需要更多的跨任务意识和合作。为了促进跨任务的发展和公平评估，作者引入了MINT，一个统一的评估套件，用于MIAs和机器生成文本检测。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

### [55] [What is the Best Sequence Length for BABYLM?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19493)
*Suchir Salhan,Richard Diehl Martinez,Zébulon Goriely,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了序列长度对BabyLM预训练的影响，发现最佳序列长度取决于任务和架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在BabyLM挑战中，许多过去的提交默认使用较短的序列长度。本文研究了序列长度对BabyLM预训练的影响，以回答训练Baby LMs时应使用什么序列长度的问题。

Method: 使用100M词的训练数据和固定的计算预算，比较了125M参数的Mamba和OPT模型。

Result: 较长的序列通常更好，但最佳长度取决于任务和架构。较短的序列足以完成语法泛化任务，而较长的上下文则有助于形态类比推理任务。

Conclusion: 在BabyLM预训练中，序列长度的选择取决于任务和架构。较短的序列足以完成语法泛化任务，而较长的上下文则有助于形态类比推理任务。

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

### [56] [Lookahead Routing for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19506)
*Canbin Huang,Tianyuan Shi,Yuhua Zhu,Ruijun Chen,Xiaojun Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lookahead is a new routing framework that improves multi-model system efficiency by predicting potential model outputs to make more informed routing decisions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing routing approaches for multi-model systems frame routing as a classification problem based solely on input queries, which can lead to suboptimal decisions for complex or ambiguous queries. Lookahead aims to address this by leveraging potential outputs to make more informed routing decisions.

Method: Lookahead is a routing framework that predicts potential model outputs' latent representations to guide model selection without full inference. It implements two approaches based on causal and masked language models.

Result: Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks show that Lookahead consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Lookahead consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的分类法，用于确定哪种评估方法适合哪种语音模型，并揭示了未来基准设计的重点领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前语音基础模型的评估在任务和模型类型之间是分散的，不同模型在语音处理的不同方面表现出色，因此需要不同的评估协议。

Method: 本文提出了一种统一的分类法，通过三个正交轴来评估模型：评估方面、模型能力要求以及任务或协议要求。

Result: 本文对现有的评估和基准进行了分类，并揭示了评估方法中的系统性差距，例如对韵律、交互或推理的覆盖有限。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个统一的分类法，以解决不同模型应采用何种评估方法的问题。该分类法为语音模型的评估提供了概念基础和实践指南，并揭示了未来基准设计的重点领域。

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

TL;DR: 本研究通过系统实证分析，揭示了多语言微调中灾难性遗忘的主要决定因素，并展示了跨语言对齐的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管灾难性遗忘现象已被广泛记录，但文献中关于遗忘发生的时间点存在碎片化的结果。为了澄清这种模糊性，我们进行了这项研究。

Method: 我们进行了一项系统性的实证研究，使用机器翻译作为测试平台，以确定触发多语言微调中灾难性遗忘的条件。通过在不同模型架构、数据规模和微调方法上的控制实验，我们分析了这些因素的影响。

Result: 我们发现模型和数据规模之间的相对比例是遗忘的主要决定因素。此外，我们证明了模型的指令遵循能力比其架构更关键，用于保留多语言知识。参数高效微调在缓解遗忘方面并没有明显优于完全微调。最后，我们展示了跨语言对齐可以减轻遗忘并促进对未见过的目标语言的正向迁移。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了多语言微调中灾难性遗忘的主要决定因素，并展示了跨语言对齐如何减轻遗忘并促进对未见过的目标语言的正向迁移。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏针对波斯文化背景下的社会偏见资源，因此需要创建一个专门用于评估波斯大型语言模型社会偏见的基准数据集。

Method: 引入了PBBQ基准数据集，该数据集通过问卷调查收集了250名不同背景的人的数据，并与社会科学研究人员合作以确保其有效性。

Result: 当前的大型语言模型在波斯文化中表现出显著的社会偏见，并且它们的输出通常复制人类的偏见模式。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在波斯文化中表现出显著的社会偏见，并且经常复制人类的偏见模式，这表明了学习到的表示和文化刻板印象之间的复杂相互作用。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨语言新闻分析数据集是由记者和专家手动整理的，限制了其可扩展性和适应新语言的能力。

Method: 我们引入了一个可扩展且可解释的众包管道，用于跨语言新闻相似性评估，并收集了一个新的数据集CrossNews-UA。

Result: 我们测试了各种模型，从传统的词袋、基于Transformer的架构到大型语言模型（LLMs），结果表明了多语言新闻分析的挑战。

Conclusion: 我们的研究突出了多语言新闻分析的挑战，并提供了对模型性能的见解。

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于样式的攻击方法 SAD，该方法利用风格化文本对 NLP 模型造成干扰，并在多个任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的增长，用户使用风格化字体和类似字体的emoji来表达个性，创建了视觉上吸引人的文本，但这些字体在NLP模型中引入了隐藏的漏洞。

Method: 提出了一种基于样式的攻击方法，称为 Style Attack Disguise (SAD)，并设计了两种大小：轻量级用于查询效率，强大版用于优越的攻击性能。

Result: 在情感分类和机器翻译任务中，SAD表现出强大的攻击性能，并展示了其对多模态任务的潜在威胁。

Conclusion: SAD 的潜在威胁，包括文本到图像和文本到语音生成等多模态任务。

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成在代码补全中效果显著，但上下文的引入导致序列长度增加，影响推理速度，限制了其在交互式环境中的应用。

Method: 引入LlavaCode框架，将代码压缩为紧凑的语义表示，并使用小型投影模块提升编码模型的EM和ES指标。

Result: 实验表明，压缩上下文使行补全任务的TTFT减少了20-38%。

Conclusion: 压缩上下文能够显著减少首次标记时间，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

Motivation: 尽管当前模型表现良好，但开放式文本中的自动情绪分析仍然面临重大挑战，如上下文歧义、语言变化和难以解释复杂的情绪表达。这些限制使得通用模型的直接应用变得困难。

Method: 比较微调和提示工程在情绪检测中的效果，包括三个不同的场景：(i) 微调预训练模型和通用大语言模型使用简单提示的性能；(ii) 不同情绪提示设计在大语言模型中的有效性；(iii) 情绪分组技术对这些模型的影响。

Result: 实验测试中，微调的预训练模型在情感识别方面的指标超过了70%。此外，研究结果表明，大语言模型需要结构化的提示工程和情绪分组来提高其性能。

Conclusion: 这些进展提高了情感分析、人机交互和对用户行为的理解，适用于各种领域。

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

Result: 我们的方法在五种模型和八个基准测试中进行了全面评估，实现了可比较或改进的准确性，同时将令牌使用量减少了高达22.4%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在五种模型和八个基准测试中进行了全面评估，实现了可比较或改进的准确性，同时将令牌使用量减少了高达22.4%，为计算高效的推理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 在干扰易发的环境中部署大型模型时，需要同时考虑语义、隐私和可预测的延迟。

Method: CoSense-LLM是一个边缘优先框架，它将连续的多模态传感器流转换为紧凑且可验证的语义标记，并在显式延迟、能量、带宽和隐私约束下与大型语言模型协调工作。该系统包括四个部分：SenseFusion、Edge-RAG、PromptRouter和Secure Execution。

Result: CoSense-LLM在家庭、办公室和诊所部署中提供了有根据的解释，同时满足严格的服务水平目标：它在边缘主导路径上保持亚秒级（p95）端到端延迟，通过优先本地检索地面响应来减少跨层级令牌和带宽成本，并通过仅传输离散代码和经过删节的元数据来保护隐私。

Conclusion: 结果支持了以边缘为中心的设计，将语义、隐私和可预测的延迟作为大型模型在易受干扰环境中的共同目标。

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

*Addison J. Wu,Ryan Liu,Kerem Oktar,Theodore R. Sumers,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies whether LLMs can evaluate content by considering the motivations of the source. Results show that LLMs have some sensitivity to motivations but need improvements for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: For LLMs to be effective in the real world, they must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of the source.

Method: We first employ controlled experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts.

Result: LLMs successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner in controlled experiments, but their inferences do not track the rational models' predictions closely in real-world settings. However, a simple steering intervention that boosts the salience of intentions and incentives increases the correspondence between LLMs and the rational model.

Conclusion: LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Motivation: 研究提示与内部表示质量之间的关系，以了解预训练嵌入如何支持上下文中的任务解决。

Method: 进行了一系列关于提示嵌入的探测实验，分析了各种零样本分类的提示模板组合。

Result: 提示会影响表示的质量，但这些变化并不总是与提示与目标任务的相关性一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了相关提示必然导致更好表示的假设，并分析了可能导致这种意外行为的因素。

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further

*Ashish Chouhan,Michael Gertz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EUDial, a multi-turn dialogue dataset, and LexGuide, a framework that uses retrieval-augmented generation to structure legal dialogues, improving citizen comprehension of legal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge, particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex institutional texts.

Method: We propose the LexGuide framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic organization to structure dialogue progression.

Result: The results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension.

Conclusion: EUDial and LexGuide are practical resources for advancing proactive legal dialogue systems.

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

*M. H. I. Abdalla,Zhipin Wang,Christian Frey,Steffen Eger,Josif Grabocka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Zhyper是一种参数高效的因子化超网络框架，能够从文本描述中生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器，实现与现有方法相当的性能，同时减少参数数量，并在文化对齐方面表现出更好的泛化能力和更精确的细粒度上下文价值捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通过直接调节LoRA权重来微调LLM，但这种方法引入了大量的参数。为了解决这个问题，提出了Zhyper框架。

Method: Zhyper是一种参数高效的因子化超网络框架，能够从文本描述中生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器。

Result: Zhyper在多个基准测试中实现了与最先进的基线相当的性能，同时参数数量减少了多达26倍。此外，Zhyper在文化对齐方面表现出更好的泛化能力和更精确的细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Conclusion: Zhyper是一种参数高效的因子化超网络框架，能够从文本描述中生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器，实验表明其在多个基准测试中表现出色，且参数数量比最先进的基线少多达26倍。此外，Zhyper被扩展到文化对齐，展示了对域外设置的更好泛化能力和更精确的细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

*Xichen Zhang,Sitong Wu,Haoru Tan,Shaozuo Yu,Yinghao Zhu,Ziyi He,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 SmartSwitch 的推理框架，用于解决大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的思考不足问题，通过监控推理过程并引导模型深入探索有潜力的想法，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链式思维（LongCoT）能力是最近大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中取得突破的关键。然而，'思考不足'的问题限制了性能和令牌效率。

Method: 我们提出了一个简单而有效的推理策略：SmartSwitch 推理框架。该框架可以轻松集成到任何大型语言模型中作为即插即用的解决方案，持续监控模型的推理过程以检测不足思考并引导其深入探索有潜力但被忽视的想法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中进行了广泛的实验，结果表明我们的方法显著提升了各种大型语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著提升了不同大小的大型语言模型的性能。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

*Yuezhou Hu,Jiaxin Guo,Xinyu Feng,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSPEC is a novel method that improves the token acceptance rate in Speculative Decoding by selectively filtering difficult tokens during knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of Speculative Decoding hinges on the alignment between models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation. However, conventional KD methods are misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance rate.

Method: AdaSPEC incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process, using a reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens.

Result: AdaSPEC improves the overall token acceptance rate without compromising generation quality, and it achieves higher acceptance rates across diverse tasks compared to DistillSpec.

Conclusion: AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across all tasks (up to 15%).

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了模型合并作为代码混合自然语言处理的常规适应策略的实用替代方案。通过持续预训练和合并检查点，我们发现合并模型在多个任务中表现优于完整微调和CPT->FT，表明未标记数据被更有效地利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们研究模型合并作为代码混合自然语言处理的常规适应策略的实际替代方案。

Method: 我们从多语言基础模型开始，进行持续预训练（CPT）在未标记的混合代码文本上，获得适应的检查点，然后将检查点与基础模型合并，并在下游任务数据上进行微调（FT）。

Result: 我们的结果表明，合并的模型始终优于完整的微调和CPT->FT。我们观察到F1得分提高了2-5个百分点，超过了完整的微调，约1-2个百分点超过了CPT->FT，这表明通过合并比单独使用CPT更有效地利用了未标记的数据。

Conclusion: 我们得出适应方案，以匹配常见的数据制度（仅标记；标记+未标记；仅传输），并讨论了更广泛任务和更大模型的限制和扩展考虑。

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

*Saptarshi Sengupta,Zhengyu Zhou,Jun Araki,Xingbo Wang,Bingqing Wang,Suhang Wang,Zhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ToolDreamer框架，该框架利用LLM生成的假设工具描述来改善工具检索，提高检索效果并减轻LLM的负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索模型基于用户查询和工具描述（TD）之间的相似性对工具进行排序。这导致了次优的检索，因为用户请求通常与TD的语言不一致。为了弥补这个问题，我们提出了ToolDreamer框架。

Method: 我们提出了ToolDreamer，这是一个框架，用于根据使用LLM生成的假设（合成）TD来调整检索器模型以获取工具，即LLM认为可能对查询有用的工具描述。

Result: 我们在ToolRet数据集上应用ToolDreamer，并展示了我们的方法在没有训练的情况下提高了稀疏和密集检索器的性能，从而展示了其灵活性。

Conclusion: 通过我们提出的框架，我们的目标是将一部分推理负担转移到检索器上，使LLM能够有效地处理大量工具而不淹没其上下文窗口。

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的提示空间优化框架，通过系统地转换翻译后的提示来提升多语言大语言模型的性能，取得了显著的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于翻译的提示策略继承了以英语为中心的框架和风格，并忽略了文化维度，最终限制了模型的泛化能力。我们认为被忽视的提示空间——定义训练分布的输入——为提高多语言性能提供了更强大的杠杆。

Method: 我们引入了一个轻量级的提示空间优化框架，其中翻译后的提示被系统地转换以实现自然性、文化适应性和难度增强。

Result: 在相同的条件下，我们的方法在翻译-only基线上实现了显著且一致的下游改进：Global-MMLU准确率提高了4.7%，Flores XCometXL提高了2.4%，在mArenaHard中的偏好赢得了35.3%。

Conclusion: 我们建立了提示空间优化作为一种简单而强大的构建多语言大语言模型的范式，使模型更加稳健、文化根基深厚且具有全球能力。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Scaf-GRPO的渐进式训练框架，用于解决强化学习中因'学习悬崖'现象导致的模型无法解决超出其能力范围的问题。通过在模型独立学习停滞时提供最小指导，Scaf-GRPO显著提升了模型在数学基准测试中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在面对超出模型当前能力的问题时，会因零奖励信号而失效，导致学习梯度无法推进。因此，需要一种新的方法来克服这一限制，使模型能够解决更复杂的问题。

Method: 本文引入了Scaf-GRPO（分层组相对策略优化）框架，通过在模型独立学习停滞时提供最小指导来解决'学习悬崖'问题。该框架首先诊断学习停滞，然后通过注入分层提示（从抽象概念到具体步骤）帮助模型自行构建有效解决方案。

Result: 在挑战性的数学基准测试中，Scaf-GRPO显著提升了Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型在AIME24基准上的pass@1分数，比原始GRPO基线提高了44.3%。这证明了该框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Scaf-GRPO的渐进式训练框架，以克服强化学习中由于'学习悬崖'现象导致的模型无法解决超出其能力范围的问题。实验结果表明，该框架能够显著提升模型在数学基准测试中的表现，证明了其在解锁模型解决问题能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

TL;DR: Hubble is an open-source suite of LLMs designed to study memorization risks. It reveals that memorization depends on data frequency and corpus size, and suggests best practices for mitigating risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to study LLM memorization risks and develop strategies to mitigate them. It seeks to provide an open-source framework for researchers to explore and address these risks.

Method: Hubble models are pretrained on large English corpora, with perturbed variants trained with controlled insertion of text to emulate memorization risks. The study analyzes the impact of sensitive data frequency and training corpus size on memorization.

Result: The study shows that memorization risks depend on the frequency of sensitive data relative to the training corpus size. Sensitive data without continued exposure can be forgotten, and inserting text at different pretraining phases affects memorization. Hubble also serves as a testbed for membership inference and machine unlearning.

Conclusion: Hubble enables a broad range of memorization research and provides insights into how sensitive data can be memorized and forgotten. It suggests best practices for addressing memorization risks and invites the community to further explore and build upon the work.

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive

analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative

Motivation: 旨在减少计算负担，通过模式选择和早期退出来优化推理过程。

Conclusion: 现有方法仅依赖模型提供的信息在信息有限的场景下不足以有效解决模式选择问题，这突显了该任务的持续挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

Motivation: 现有的代理基准未能充分评估深度搜索代理在应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册和关税规则）方面的能力，而这些规则在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 引入HSCodeComp基准，通过真实世界数据和专家标注的10位Harmonized System Code (HSCode) 来评估深度搜索代理的层级规则应用能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLMs、开源和闭源代理在10位HSCode预测任务中的表现远低于人类专家，最佳代理的准确率为46.8%，而人类专家达到95.0%。

Conclusion: 当前的代理基准在评估深度搜索代理的复杂规则应用能力方面存在不足，HSCodeComp基准的引入填补了这一空白。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of MLX, a framework optimized for machine learning computations on Apple silicon devices, by comparing the inference latency of transformer models with their PyTorch counterparts. The results show MLX's potential for efficient on-device ML applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning has sparked research interest in deploying these models on smaller devices. This creates a need for frameworks that can take advantage of on-device hardware, leading to the creation of the MLX framework optimized for machine learning computations on Apple silicon devices.

Conclusion: MLX's potential in enabling efficient and more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem is highlighted.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BAPO的强化学习方法，通过动态调整剪切边界来解决离策略设置中的优化不平衡问题，从而实现更稳定和高效的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离策略设置中应用强化学习（RL）具有挑战性，因为策略熵急剧下降，优化可能不稳定甚至崩溃。

Method: BAPO通过动态调整剪切边界来重新平衡正负贡献，保持熵并稳定RL优化。

Result: BAPO在多种离策略场景中实现了快速、稳定和数据高效的训练，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: BAPO在AIME 2024和AIME 2025基准测试中表现出色，超越了开源模型和领先的专有系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda 是一种新型的参数高效微调方法，能够在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度的模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要分为两类：添加型和选择性原位适应。添加型方法如 LoRA 引入额外模块来适应下游任务，具有较强的内存效率，但表示能力有限，不适合细粒度适应。选择性原位适应方法直接微调原始模型参数的一个子集，可以实现更精确和有效的适应，但内存消耗显著增加。为了调和这种权衡，提出了 NeuroAda 方法。

Method: NeuroAda 首先识别重要的参数（即网络中的连接），然后为这些选定的参数引入旁路连接。在微调过程中，仅更新旁路连接，而原始模型参数保持冻结。

Result: 在 23 个以上的任务上进行的实证结果表明，NeuroAda 在仅使用 ≤0.02% 可训练参数的情况下实现了最先进的性能，同时将 CUDA 内存使用量减少了高达 60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda 是一种新型的参数高效微调方法，能够在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度的模型微调。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Conclusion: 通过系统探索混合架构中不同注意力机制的比例，我们已经确定了目前最优的模型结构。此外，借助自主研发的高性能FP8运算符库-linghe，整体训练效率提高了50%。由于训练和推理引擎运算符之间的高对齐性，模型可以在强化学习阶段进行长期、稳定且高效的优化，持续保持在多个具有挑战性的复杂推理基准上的SOTA性能。

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的遗忘框架BS，通过结合模型的高置信度生成来对抗概率质量重新分布的问题，从而实现更彻底的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘方法在降低特定目标响应的概率时，会导致概率质量重新分布到高可能性区域，这可能对应于目标的语义相关重述，这种现象被称为压缩效应，导致许多方法仅产生虚假的遗忘效果。

Method: 本文提出了一个称为BS的框架，该框架通过将压缩效应与模型的高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来，以直接对抗压缩效应。BS-T（token）抑制高概率标记，而BS-S（sequence）移除整个高置信度生成。

Result: 在多种基准测试和不同模型家族上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为BS的框架，通过显式关联模型的高置信度生成（即模型信念）与压缩效应，从而更彻底地遗忘敏感或有害内容，同时保持模型的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: GaLLoP是一种基于梯度的稀疏微调技术，能够有效提升模型性能并减少对预训练知识的破坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏微调技术效果受限于参数选择的优化，因此需要一种更有效的参数选择方法。

Method: GaLLoP通过选择在下游任务上梯度幅度最大且预训练时幅度最小的参数进行微调，从而实现稀疏适应。

Result: 实验表明，GaLLoP在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B等基模型上表现优于或与LoRA、DoRA、SAFT等现有技术相当。

Conclusion: GaLLoP是一种有效的稀疏微调技术，能够在保持预训练知识的同时，提高模型在分布内和分布外任务上的性能。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过独立性检验来证明Bob使用了Alice的模型，结果表明可以通过测试统计量检测相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是确定Alice是否能够证明Bob使用了她的模型，无论是在查询设置还是观察设置中。

Method: 本文将问题形式化为独立性检验，并通过语言模型中的回文记忆现象进行研究，利用测试统计量来检测相关性。在查询设置中，直接估计Bob模型对Alice训练示例和顺序的可能性；在观察设置中，尝试两种方法来估计Bob文本与Alice训练示例的重叠可能性以及不同版本的Alice模型的可能性。

Result: 在查询设置中，对各种Pythia和OLMo基础模型进行了超过40次微调，结果显示出极低的p值（最多1e-8）。在观察设置中，第二种方法可以可靠地区分Bob的文本，而第一种方法需要更多的文本才能达到高功效。

Conclusion: 本文通过独立性检验问题探讨了Alice如何证明Bob使用了她的模型，结果表明可以通过测试统计量来检测Bob的模型或文本与Alice训练数据顺序之间的相关性。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在现实世界中的应用日益增加，保护它们免受不安全、恶意或侵犯隐私的内容至关重要。现有的解决方案在全面性和实用性上存在不足，因此需要一个更完善的系统。

Method: OpenGuardrails 采用了一个统一的大规模模型来实现内容安全和模型操纵检测，并使用轻量级的 NER 流水线（如 Presidio 风格的模型或基于正则表达式的检测器）来进行数据泄露识别和删除。

Result: OpenGuardrails 在安全基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，在英语、中文和多语言任务中的提示和响应分类方面表现出色。

Conclusion: OpenGuardrails 是一个重要的开源项目，为大型语言模型提供了全面的安全防护和检测机制，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, safeguarding them against unsafe, malicious, or
privacy-violating content is critically important. We present OpenGuardrails,
the first open-source project to provide both a context-aware safety and
manipulation detection model and a deployable platform for comprehensive AI
guardrails. OpenGuardrails protects against content-safety risks,
model-manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking,
code-interpreter abuse, and the generation/execution of malicious code), and
data leakage. Content-safety and model-manipulation detection are implemented
by a unified large model, while data-leakage identification and redaction are
performed by a separate lightweight NER pipeline (e.g., Presidio-style models
or regex-based detectors). The system can be deployed as a security gateway or
an API-based service, with enterprise-grade, fully private deployment options.
OpenGuardrails achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on safety
benchmarks, excelling in both prompt and response classification across
English, Chinese, and multilingual tasks. All models are released under the
Apache 2.0 license for public use.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了两个端到端的模型StutterZero和StutterFormer，用于将口吃语音直接转换为流畅语音，并同时预测其转录文本。这两个模型在多个基准测试中表现出色，显著降低了词错误率并提高了语义相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的口吃校正方法依赖于手工特征提取或多阶段自动语音识别(ASR)和文本到语音(TTS)管道，这些方法将转录与音频重建分开，并且经常放大失真。

Method: 该研究引入了StutterZero和StutterFormer，这是第一个端到端的波形到波形模型，可以直接将口吃语音转换为流畅语音，并同时预测其转录文本。StutterZero采用卷积双向LSTM编码器-解码器，而StutterFormer集成了双流Transformer。

Result: 在所有基准测试中，StutterZero的词错误率(WER)减少了24%，语义相似性(BERTScore)提高了31%，而StutterFormer实现了更好的结果，WER减少了28%，BERTScore提高了34%。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了直接端到端的口吃转流畅语音转换的可行性，为包容性人机交互、语音治疗和面向可访问性的AI系统提供了新的机会。

Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic
speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them
accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature
extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech
(TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and
often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer,
the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert
stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription.
StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with
attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with
shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on
paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter
corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across
all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a
31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading
Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28%
decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the
feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering
new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and
accessibility-oriented AI systems.

Abstract: Navigating health questions can be daunting in the modern information
landscape. Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible
information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present
insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people
interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed
the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific
details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs
was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several
turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a "Wayfinding AI" to
proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated
the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns
compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of
proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design
patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.

Conclusion: AutoPage not only generates high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency in under 15 minutes for less than $0.1.

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as
the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,
repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers
accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the
dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.
To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not
in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce
$\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.
AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline
from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive
rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each
step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the
final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the
system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously
validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first
benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates
high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PoSh指标和DOCENT数据集，以改进详细图像描述的评估，并展示了PoSh在相关任务上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标准指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）适用于短文本，并且针对现在不常见的错误（如对象误识别）进行了调整。然而，长文本需要对属性和关系附件敏感，并且需要能够定位到特定文本片段的分数。

Method: 引入了PoSh指标，利用场景图作为结构化的评分标准，指导LLM作为评判者，从而产生基于细粒度错误的综合评分。同时，提出了DOCENT数据集，用于评估详细图像描述指标和图像描述本身。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类判断有更强的相关性（+0.05 Spearman ρ），并且在使用CapArena数据集时具有鲁棒性。此外，PoSh作为一种奖励函数表现优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT有助于推动视觉语言模型在详细图像描述方面的进步，特别是在辅助文本生成等重要领域。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

*Simone Alghisi,Gabriel Roccabruna,Massimo Rizzoli,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了VLMs在计数任务中的推理能力，发现其对物体数量、类型和空间排列敏感，并通过微调输出层提高了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在多个下游任务中表现出色，但它们在视觉推理方面仍存在局限性，如识别关系、理解时间序列和计数物体。因此，需要深入研究其失败原因并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过受控实验条件研究七种最先进的VLMs在计数任务中的推理技能，并进行逐层分析以确定错误原因。此外，进行了针对性的训练以改进模型。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物的共现高度敏感。逐层分析显示，错误是由于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射不正确。针对训练表明，仅微调输出层可将准确率提高高达21%。

Conclusion: VLMs的推理能力可以通过仅微调输出层来显著提高，并在现实世界的数据集上得到了验证。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有的世界模型主要用于世界模拟，并与轨迹规划解耦，而将世界建模与规划统一在一个框架中的努力仍需进一步探索。因此，本文旨在开发一种新的驾驶范式，以更好地利用世界模型来提升规划性能。

Method: 本文引入了策略世界模型（PWM），它结合了世界建模和轨迹规划，并通过无动作的未来状态预测方案来提升规划性能。此外，还提出了动态增强的并行标记生成机制，包括上下文引导的分词器和自适应动态焦点损失。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管仅使用前视摄像头输入，本文的方法在性能上与依赖多视角和多模态输入的最先进方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的驾驶范式——策略世界模型（PWM），它不仅在统一的架构中集成了世界建模和轨迹规划，还能通过提出的无动作未来状态预测方案利用学习到的世界知识来提升规划。尽管只使用了前视摄像头输入，但该方法在性能上与依赖多视角和多模态输入的最先进方法相当或更优。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.
Code and model weights will be released at

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Conclusion: ColorAgent在AndroidWorld和AndroidLab基准测试中分别取得了77.2%和50.7%的成功率，建立了新的最先进水平。然而，当前的基准测试不足以全面评估OS代理，并提出了未来工作方向，特别是在评估范式、代理协作和安全方面。

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model
technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved
from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions.
Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions
and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical
report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon,
robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and
proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the
environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise
reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a
tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and
robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent
recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an
automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on
the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2%
and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we
note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of
OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly
in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our
code is available at https://github.com/MadeAgents/mobile-use.
