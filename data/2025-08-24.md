### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的共同训练框架，以提高大型语言模型的内容安全性，并在推理时提供细粒度的控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前内容安全方法（如SFT和RLHF）依赖多阶段训练流程，缺乏细粒度的后部署控制能力。本文旨在解决这些限制，提高模型的安全性和可控性。

Method: 本文提出了一种统一的共同训练框架，将多种安全行为（积极、消极和拒绝性）整合到一个SFT阶段中，并通过魔法令牌实现动态激活。

Result: 实验表明，本文方法在安全对齐质量上与SFT+DPO相当，且8B模型在安全性能上显著优于DeepSeek-R1（671B），同时大幅降低了训练复杂性和部署成本。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种统一的共同训练框架，能够高效地整合多种安全行为，并在推理时通过简单的系统级指令实现行为切换，从而提供更精细的控制和更高的安全性。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WMT25通用机器翻译任务的初步排名已发布，但最终排名将基于人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分享初步结果以帮助参与者准备系统提交论文。

Method: 通过自动评估对机器翻译系统进行初步排名。

Result: 初步排名可能因使用重排序技术而存在偏差。

Conclusion: 正式的WMT25排名将基于人工评估，而自动排名可能偏向使用重排序技术的系统。

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本地化框架，用于自动构建包含本土名称、组织和货币的数学问题数据集。实验表明，该框架可以减轻英语中心实体偏见，并在引入本土实体时提高各种语言的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言基准测试主要通过翻译生成，通常保留英语中心的实体，由于人工标注的高成本，自动化本地化工具有限，因此真正本地化的数据集仍然稀缺。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本地化框架，用于自动构建包含本土名称、组织和货币的数学问题数据集。

Result: 实验表明，翻译的基准测试可能会在适当的社会文化背景下掩盖真正的多语言数学能力。此外，本文提出的框架可以减轻英语中心实体偏见，并在引入本土实体时提高各种语言的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本地化框架，以自动构建包含本土名称、组织和货币的数学问题数据集。实验表明，该框架可以减轻英语中心实体偏见，并在引入本土实体时提高各种语言的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何利用少量数据资源改进通用指令调整的大语言模型进行机器翻译。通过使用直接偏好优化（DPO）训练，我们在斯洛文尼亚语案例中改进了GaMS-9B-Instruct模型。实验表明，微调后的模型在翻译维基百科文章时表现优于参与数据集生成的两个模型，并且更一致地避免了语言和格式错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何使用相对少量容易产生的数据资源改进通用指令调整的大语言模型进行机器翻译。

Method: 我们使用直接偏好优化（DPO）训练，在程序策划和增强的公共数据集子集上改进了GaMS-9B-Instruct模型。我们通过使用两个LLM（GaMS-9B-Instruct和EuroLLM-9B-Instruct）翻译英文维基百科文章生成了DPO的训练数据集，并根据启发式方法和自动评估指标（如COMET）对结果翻译进行了排序。

Result: 微调后的模型在翻译维基百科文章时表现出更高的性能，COMET得分分别比参与数据集生成的两个模型提高了约0.04和0.02，并且更一致地避免了语言和格式错误。

Conclusion: 我们的微调模型在翻译维基百科文章时，与基线模型相比，COMET得分分别提高了约0.04和0.02，并且更一致地避免了语言和格式错误。

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个新的多语言数据集MultiCoXQL和Compass，以改进ConvXAI系统在多语言环境下的表现和支持自定义输入的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的ConvXAI系统在多语言泛化和支持自定义输入方面存在不足，需要新的数据集和方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 本文首先引入了MultiCoXQL，这是一个多语言扩展的CoXQL数据集，涵盖了五种语言。然后提出了一种新的解析方法，用于提高多语言解析性能，并在MultiCoXQL上评估了三种大型语言模型。此外，还介绍了Compass，一个用于ConvXAI系统中自定义输入提取的新多语言数据集，并进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估。

Result: 本文提出的MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集能够有效支持多语言ConvXAI系统的开发，并通过评估不同模型的表现验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集，以解决当前ConvXAI系统在多语言泛化和支持自定义输入方面的不足，并评估了不同模型在这些数据集上的表现。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的奖励偏移推测采样算法，旨在解决测试时对齐中的效率瓶颈问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的研究越来越关注测试时对齐，但在推理过程中分配额外计算以提高LLM的安全性和推理能力。然而，这些测试时对齐技术通常会带来巨大的推理成本，限制了它们的实际应用。

Method: 我们引入了奖励偏移的推测采样（SSS）算法，其中草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励令牌分布，理论上证明了可以利用对齐草稿模型和未对齐目标模型之间的分布差异来恢复RLHF最优解。

Result: 我们的算法在测试时弱到强对齐实验中实现了显著降低的推理成本下的优越黄金奖励分数。

Conclusion: 我们的算法在测试时弱到强对齐实验中实现了显著降低的推理成本下的优越黄金奖励分数，从而验证了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案、过滤候选匹配和验证对齐性来提高召回准确性，适用于医学、法律等需要完整机器生成文本的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的召回度量通常依赖于词汇重叠，导致与未经证实的实体和改写答案相关的错误，而基于LLM的法官方法在没有结构化验证的情况下容易出现不对齐和幻觉。

Method: LongRecall通过将答案分解为自包含的事实，依次通过词汇和语义过滤缩小可能的候选匹配，并通过结构化的蕴含检查验证其对齐性，从而实现召回评估。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的长格式QA基准测试中，使用人类注释和基于LLM的法官评估LongRecall，显示出比强大的词汇和LLM-as-a-Judge基线显著的召回准确率提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall是一个有效的三阶段召回评估框架，能够减少假阳性与假阴性，并适应多种表达方式和上下文变化，为系统性的召回评估提供基础构建块。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将LLM与组合推理结合，以提高结构化预测的准确性和一致性，并证明结构化学习在LLM时代仍然有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在结构化预测方面存在幻觉和复杂推理问题，需要一种方法来提高其预测的一致性和准确性。

Method: 通过结合LLM和组合推理来解决结构化预测问题，并进行广泛的实验以确定有效的提示策略。

Result: 无论使用哪种提示策略，结合符号推理都能提高预测的一致性和准确性。此外，使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调可以提高挑战性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 结构化学习在LLM时代仍然有价值，通过结合LLM和组合推理可以提高预测的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的科学文本提取管道，能够从Common Crawl中提取高质量的数学内容，并构建了大规模的数学语料库。该语料库在数学、代码和一般推理任务中表现优异，且优于现有的开放数学数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学聚焦数据集由于脆弱的提取启发式方法、损失性的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠地保留数学结构而质量下降。因此，需要一种更可靠的方法来从Common Crawl中提取高质量的数学内容。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的、领域无关的管道，专门设计用于鲁棒的科学文本提取。该管道利用布局感知渲染（lynx）和基于LLM的清理阶段，以恢复各种格式中的数学内容（如MathJax、KaTeX、MathML），同时保留方程和代码块的结构完整性，并去除冗余内容，标准化符号为LaTeX表示，纠正不一致之处。

Result: 本文收集了一个大型、高质量的数学语料库，即Nemotron-CC-Math-3+（133B tokens）和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+（52B tokens）。Nemotron-CC-Math-4+不仅超越了所有先前的开放数学数据集，还包含比之前最高质量的数学预训练数据集FineMath-4+多5.5倍的token。使用该语料库预训练的Nemotron-T 8B模型在MATH上获得了+4.8至+12.6的提升，在MBPP+上获得了+4.6至+14.3的提升，同时在MMLU和MMLU-Stem上改善了通用领域的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个可靠的科学内容提取管道，能够从噪声大的网络规模数据中提取数学内容，并在数学、代码和一般推理方面取得了显著的提升，同时设定了开放数学预训练语料库的新基准。为了支持开源努力，我们发布了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何识别和回答带有错误假设的问题，并提出了一种利用外部证据的方法来减轻幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出带有错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大型语言模型（LLMs）由于幻觉往往会生成误导性的答案。因此，需要识别和回答带有错误假设的问题。

Method: 本文首先将问题转化为事实验证，然后提出一种利用外部证据的方法来减轻幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，结合检索到的证据是有益的，并且生成和验证原子假设可以带来更大的改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种方法，利用外部证据来减轻幻觉，并通过实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MMDR-Bench数据集和CoLVLM Agent框架，以解决现有模型在处理复杂多模态任务中的不足，并展示了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理需要深度推理、持续上下文理解和多步骤指令遵循的复杂、多轮和视觉基础任务时仍面临重大挑战，现有的基准测试无法捕捉真实世界多模态交互的动态性和复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种名为CoLVLM Agent的框架，通过迭代的'记忆-感知-规划-执行'循环来增强现有的LVLMs，无需对底层模型进行大量重新训练。

Result: 在MMDR-Bench上的实验表明，CoLVLM Agent在平均人类评估得分上表现优于最先进的商业模型，如GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂多模态交互中表现出色，验证了其模块化设计和迭代方法的有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语义感知分词框架SemToken，通过减少标记冗余和提高计算效率来优化分词过程。实验结果显示，该方法在长上下文场景中具有显著的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分词方法如字节对编码（BPE）或WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的潜在语义结构，导致语义冗余段的过度分词和上下文连贯性的未充分利用，特别是在长上下文场景中。

Method: 我们提出了SemToken，这是一个语义感知的分词框架，通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，并进行局部语义聚类以合并语义等价的标记。然后，它根据语义密度分配异构的标记粒度，允许在内容丰富的区域进行更细粒度的分词，在重复或低熵区域进行更粗略的压缩。

Result: 实验结果表明，SemToken在长上下文语言建模基准测试（如WikiText-103和LongBench）中实现了高达2.4倍的标记数减少和1.9倍的速度提升，同时在困惑度和下游准确性方面几乎没有或没有退化。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，语义结构为优化大型语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新维度。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一种针对金融任务的领域专业化过程奖励模型，通过结合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，提升了金融推理任务中大型语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRMs主要在通用或STEM领域进行训练，在金融等特定领域中表现不足，因为金融推理更结构化、符号化，并且对事实和监管正确性敏感。

Method: Fin-PRM是一种专门针对金融任务的轨迹感知过程奖励模型，结合了步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，以实现与金融逻辑一致的细粒度推理痕迹评估。

Result: Fin-PRM在金融推理基准测试（如CFLUE和FinQA）中表现出色，优于通用PRMs和强域基线。使用Fin-PRM训练的下游模型在监督学习、强化学习和测试时性能上分别提升了12.9%、5.2%和5.1%。

Conclusion: Fin-PRM展示了在金融推理任务中对LLM进行领域专业化奖励建模的价值，能够显著提升模型的表现。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK 是一种无需训练的插件方法，通过在通道级别对 KV 进行非结构化稀疏性修剪，实现了更高效的长序列处理和更低的存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 KV 缓存压缩方法往往忽略了特征维度上的细粒度重要性变化，这限制了它们在效率和模型准确性之间的有效平衡。SPARK 的提出旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPARK 通过在通道级别对 KV 进行非结构化稀疏性修剪，在注意力分数计算期间动态恢复被修剪的条目。这种方法与现有的 KV 压缩和量化技术正交，可以兼容集成以实现进一步加速。

Result: SPARK 在相同长度的序列上不仅保持或提高了模型的准确性，还比基于逐出的方法减少了超过 30% 的 KV 缓存存储。即使在 80% 的激进剪枝率下，SPARK 的性能退化也小于 5%。

Conclusion: SPARK 是一种训练-free 的方法，能够有效减少 KV 缓存的存储需求，同时保持模型的准确性。它可以在相同的内存预算下处理更长的序列，并且在高剪枝率下表现出色。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Selct2Know（S2K）的框架，通过内部和外部知识自我选择策略以及选择性监督微调来内化领域知识。同时引入了结构化推理数据生成管道并集成了GRPO以增强推理能力。实验表明，S2K在医疗、法律和金融QA基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并且以显著更低的成本达到领域预训练大语言模型的水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts, then applying them to complex reasoning.

Method: Selct2Know (S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability.

Result: Experiments on medical, legal, and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Conclusion: S2K consistently outperforms existing methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER is a self-guided method that enhances LLMs' ability to handle multi-step tool usage by continuously expanding an experience pool with past successful trajectories, leading to improved performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-step tool usage in LLMs rely on manually designing task-specific demonstrations or retrieving from a curated library, which demands substantial expert effort and becomes complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale.

Method: SEER is a self-guided method that performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved model performance.

Result: SEER achieves an average improvement of 6.1% on easy and 4.7% on hard questions on the ToolQA benchmark, and demonstrates substantial accuracy gains of 7.44% and 23.38% on $	au$-bench using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, respectively.

Conclusion: SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains and improves model performance over time by incrementally augmenting the experience pool with past successful trajectories.

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了检查表在生成任务自动评估中的作用，发现选择性使用检查表在成对比较中效果较好，但在直接评分中效果不一致，同时指出人类评估可能存在不一致之处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估生成任务面临挑战，因为标准模糊。虽然自动检查表生成是一个有前景的方法，但其有用性仍需探索。

Method: 我们研究了检查表是否应用于所有问题或选择性使用，使用六种方法生成检查表，并在八种模型大小上评估其有效性，还识别了与人类评估相关的检查表项。

Result: 实验表明，在成对比较设置中，选择性使用检查表往往会提高评估性能，而在直接评分中的效果不一致。即使与人类评分相关性较低的检查表项也反映了人工编写的标准，这表明人类评估可能存在不一致之处。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了需要更明确地定义客观评估标准，以指导人工和自动评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一种新的动态词汇选择框架，能够在减少内存使用的同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态词汇修剪方法存在信息丢失和灵活性不足的问题，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案来减少内存使用。

Method: VocabTailor是一个新的解耦动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入并采用混合静态-动态词汇选择策略来处理语言建模头。

Result: VocabTailor在多种下游任务中实现了高达99%的内存使用减少，且任务性能几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: VocabTailor能够显著减少小语言模型中与词汇相关的内存使用，同时保持任务性能几乎不变。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，微调WangchanThaiInstruct的数据集的模型表现优于使用翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在低资源、语言多样的环境中，需要基于文化和职业的指令数据来提高大型语言模型的对齐度。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成高质量代码切换语音样本的方法，并构建了一个多语言代码切换语料库，以推动多语言语音技术的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码切换（CS）在现实世界的对话中很常见，对多语言语音技术构成了重大挑战。然而，能够处理这一现象的系统仍缺乏研究，主要是由于合适数据集的稀缺。

Method: 我们提出了一个名为通用代码混合器（UniCoM）的新管道，用于生成高质量、自然的代码切换（CS）样本，同时不改变句子语义。我们的方法利用了一种称为替换单词为同义词（SWORDS）的算法，通过考虑词性来替换选定的单词为其翻译。

Result: 实验结果表明，CS-FLEURS在客观和主观指标上都能达到与现有数据集相当的高可理解性和自然度。

Conclusion: 我们期望我们的方法能推动代码切换语音技术的发展，并使更多的多语言系统更加包容。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对模拟职业（如教师角色）的大型语言模型在心理和伦理方面的全面评估，因此需要一个专门的框架来评估这些模型的伦理和心理对齐情况。

Method: 本文引入了EMNLP框架，用于个性分析、道德发展阶段测量和软提示注入下的伦理风险评估，并构建了88个特定于教师的道德困境。

Result: 实验表明，教师角色的大型语言模型表现出更加理想化和极化的个性，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异，但在情感复杂情境中存在困难。模型温度和其他超参数对风险行为的影响有限。

Conclusion: 本文提出了第一个评估教师角色大型语言模型伦理和心理对齐的基准，为教育人工智能提供了重要的参考。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

TL;DR: CARE是一种新的RAG方法，通过上下文评估器和基础LLM来解决上下文-记忆冲突，提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当检索的上下文与LLM的参数知识矛盾时，通常无法解决冲突，即上下文-记忆冲突。因此，需要一种方法来处理这种冲突，以提高RAG系统的可靠性和适应性。

Method: CARE包含一个上下文评估器和一个基础LLM。上下文评估器通过编码原始上下文标记的紧凑记忆标记嵌入来评估上下文，并通过基于事实/对抗性软提示训练以区分不可靠的上下文并捕捉指导信号，引导推理向更可靠的知识源发展。

Result: CARE在QA和事实检查基准测试中平均性能提高了5.0%，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突。

Conclusion: CARE有效地缓解了上下文-记忆冲突，为可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

Motivation: 自动挖掘时间常识对于创建稳健的语言模型至关重要，因为即使先进的大型语言模型在生成需要时间常识推理的文本时也存在困难。

Method: 提出了一种时间常识提取管道，利用大型语言模型自动挖掘时间常识，并使用它来构建TComQA数据集。

Result: TComQA数据集通过众包验证，并在提取时间常识方面实现了超过80%的精度。

Conclusion: 通过TComQA数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务中表现优于在现有数据集上微调的大型语言模型。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Result: CUPE在多种语言上的监督和自监督训练以及零镜头测试中表现出色，显示出强大的跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: CUPE模型通过在音节长度的窗口内建模基本声学模式，展示了有效的通用语音处理的可能性。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的KG评估方法EDAS，通过整合多指标和多数据集的性能，提供一个统一的评估框架，以解决现有KGC模型评估中的不一致性和不公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KGC模型评估方法在多个数据集和指标上难以进行公平比较，因为模型可能在一个数据集上表现优异但在另一个数据集上表现较差，同时不同指标之间也可能产生冲突的排名，这使得模型选择变得困难。

Method: 提出了一种基于平均解距离的KG评估方法（EDAS），该方法将模型在多个数据集和不同评估标准下的性能综合为一个归一化的分数（M_i ∈ [0,1]）。

Result: 在基准数据集如FB15k-237和WN18RR上的实验结果表明，EDAS能够有效整合多指标、多数据集的性能，提供一个统一的排名。

Conclusion: EDAS 有效地将多指标、多数据集的性能整合到一个统一的排名中，提供了一种一致、稳健且可推广的评估框架，用于评估KGC模型。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的能力取得了显著进展，但其可信度仍然是一个严峻的问题。现有的评估和缓解方法往往只关注狭窄的方面，忽视了多模态引入的风险。为了应对这些挑战，我们需要一个全面的基准来评估、分析和缓解MLLMs的信任问题。

Method: 我们提出了MultiTrust-X，这是一个全面的基准，用于评估、分析和缓解MLLMs的信任问题。我们定义了一个三维框架，涵盖了五个信任方面，包括真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性和隐私性；两种新型风险类型，涵盖多模态风险和跨模态影响；以及从数据、模型架构、训练和推理算法角度的各种缓解策略。基于这个分类法，MultiTrust-X包括32个任务和28个精心挑选的数据集，能够对30个开源和专有MLLMs进行全面评估，并使用8种代表性的缓解方法进行深入分析。

Result: 我们的实验揭示了当前模型中的显著漏洞，包括信任度与通用能力之间的差距，以及基础LLM中潜在风险在多模态训练和推理中的放大。此外，我们的受控分析发现了现有缓解策略的关键局限性，虽然某些方法在特定方面有所改进，但很少能有效解决整体信任度，许多方法引入了意外的权衡，损害了模型效用。这些发现为未来的改进提供了实用见解，例如推理在更好地平衡安全性和性能方面的优势。基于这些见解，我们引入了一种增强推理的安全对齐（RESA）方法，使模型具备链式思维推理能力以发现潜在风险，实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于置信度调制的推测解码框架，通过动态调整推测生成的标记数量和验证过程，提高了推理效率并保持了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于静态的起草长度和刚性的验证标准，限制了它们在不同模型不确定性和输入复杂性下的适应性。因此，需要一种更灵活、自适应的方法来提高推测解码的效果。

Method: 本文利用熵和基于边距的不确定性度量来动态调整每次迭代中推测生成的标记数量，并通过相同的置信度信号调节验证过程，以更灵活地接受推测的标记。

Result: 实验表明，在机器翻译和摘要任务中，该方法在保持或提高BLEU和ROUGE分数的同时，显著提高了标准推测解码的速度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于置信度调制的推测解码的信息理论框架，该方法在不同不确定性条件下提供了高效且稳健的解码方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究表明，更大的词汇表有助于降低分词文本的复杂度，从而提升语言模型的性能，这为分词器-模型协同设计提供了新的思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实践中倾向于使用越来越大的词汇表，但其优势的来源尚不明确。本文旨在探讨词汇量扩大对语言模型性能的影响，并揭示其中的机制。

Method: 本文进行了一项受控研究，将语言模型的词汇量从24K扩展到196K，同时保持数据、计算和优化不变。通过Kolmogorov复杂度量化了分词文本的复杂度，并分析了词汇量扩大对交叉熵损失的影响。此外，还研究了输入和输出嵌入范数约束对token频率不平衡的影响。

Result: 较大的词汇表减少了分词文本的复杂度，但进一步增长主要加深了相对token频率的不平衡。更大的词汇表几乎仅通过降低最常见2,500个单词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，尽管稀有尾部的损失上升。约束输入和输出嵌入范数可以逆转这种优势，直接表明模型利用而非遭受不平衡。由于相同的常见单词覆盖了下游基准测试中大约77%的token，这种训练优势得以完整传递。

Conclusion: 本文重新诠释了'更大的词汇表有助于语言模型'这一观点，将其视为'降低分词文本的复杂性有助于'，提供了一个简单且有原则的杠杆，用于分词器-模型协同设计，并澄清了控制语言模型预训练中损失动态的机制。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在训练过程中改进模态平衡和更复杂的融合机制的必要性，以提高处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Conclusion: PyTOD demonstrates the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking by surpassing strong baselines in accuracy and robust user goal estimation.

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to

using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: SLM4Offer demonstrates the effectiveness of contrastive objectives in advancing personalized marketing, showing a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised fine-tuning baseline.

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型（LLM）是否能够有效捕捉用户主观的行为和偏好，特别是在浏览网站或应用时产生的序列行为日志，这些日志类似于用户自建的“语言”，但缺乏自然语言的结构和语法。

Method: 研究提出了HeTLM（Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model）方法，用于处理主观行为和偏好，同时比较了不同大小的语言模型和不同训练策略的效果。

Result: 研究发现，小型语言模型在页面级分词器上训练的表现优于大型预训练或微调语言模型；HeTLM方法在相同家族的单个语言模型上表现更好；并且生成结果的平均值更高且方差更低，表明对用户的对齐效果更好。

Conclusion: 通过引入HeTLM（Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model）方法，研究发现小型语言模型在页面级分词器上训练的表现优于大型预训练或微调语言模型，并且具有异构聚类特定参数的HeTLM在相同家族的单个语言模型上表现更好。此外，生成结果的平均值更高且方差更低，表明对用户的对齐效果更好。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

Motivation: 动机：当前的课程学习在预训练语言模型中表现有限，因此需要寻找更有效的难度度量方法。

Method: 方法：研究通过将训练示例按其训练数据影响进行排序来探索课程学习的有效性。

Result: 结果：使用我们的课程训练的模型在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的模型高出超过10个百分点。

Conclusion: 结论：课程学习在采用更以模型为中心的难度概念时，对于语言模型预训练是有益的。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

TL;DR: HebID is a multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection, showing that Hebrew-tuned LLMs perform best, and it offers insights into identity expression in Israeli politics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for group and identity detection are predominantly English-centric, single-label, and focus on coarse identity categories.

Method: We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection, and benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter generative LLMs.

Result: Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results (macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity expression.

Conclusion: HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in other non-English political contexts.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Result: Dream 7B在多个任务中表现出色，并具有任意顺序生成、填充能力和可调的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: Dream 7B在通用、数学和编码任务上表现优于现有的扩散语言模型，并展示了优越的规划能力和推理灵活性。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 本文进行了首次大规模计算研究政治去合法化话语（PDD），并提出了一种两阶段分类管道，用于检测和分类PDD。研究发现PDD在三十年间显著增加，社交媒体上的PDD比议会辩论更普遍，男性政治人物使用更多，右翼人士更为明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们旨在进行首次大规模计算研究政治去合法化话语（PDD），以符号攻击政治实体的规范有效性。

Method: 我们引入了一个两阶段分类管道，结合微调的编码器模型和解码器大语言模型（LLMs）。

Result: 我们的最佳模型（DictaLM 2.0）在二元PDD检测中达到了F1值为0.74，在分类去合法化特征中达到了宏F1值为0.67。

Conclusion: 我们的研究证明了自动化政治去合法化话语分析在理解民主话语中的可行性和价值。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Conclusion: 本文提出了SafetyFlow，这是一个自动化构建LLM安全基准的代理流系统，能够显著减少时间和资源成本。最终构建的数据集SafetyFlowBench具有低冗余和强区分能力，并验证了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: SDGO通过利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，提高生成安全性，无需额外数据或模型，在保持帮助性的同时显著提升模型安全性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在识别有害请求方面比防御它们更有效，因此需要探索对齐模型的内在判别和生成能力的方法。

Method: SDGO是一种强化学习框架，利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来提高生成安全性。该方法在训练阶段不需要任何额外的注释数据或外部模型。

Result: 实验表明，SDGO在保持通用基准上的帮助性的同时，相比基于提示和基于训练的基线显著提高了模型的安全性。此外，这种对齐使得模型的生成能力能够仅用少量判别样本进一步增强。

Conclusion: SDGO通过对齐LLM的判别和生成能力，显著提高了模型的安全性，并在保持通用基准上的帮助性的同时，增强了对分布外（OOD）越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Motivation: 科学调查文章在总结研究进展方面发挥着至关重要的作用，但其手动创建由于学术文献的快速增长而变得越来越不可行。虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）为自动化这一过程提供了有希望的能力，但该领域的进展受到缺乏标准化基准和评估协议的阻碍。

Method: 我们引入了SurGE（调查生成评估），一个用于评估计算机科学领域科学调查生成的新基准。SurGE包括（1）一组测试实例，每个实例包括主题描述、专家撰写的调查及其完整的引用列表，以及（2）一个包含超过一百万篇论文的大规模学术语料库，作为检索池。此外，我们提出了一种自动化评估框架，从四个维度测量生成的调查：信息覆盖范围、引用准确性、结构组织和内容质量。

Result: 我们对多种基于LLM的方法进行了评估，结果显示，即使对于先进的自我反思框架，调查生成仍然是一个高度挑战性的任务。

Conclusion: 调查生成仍然具有高度挑战性，即使对于先进的自我反思框架也是如此。这些发现突显了任务的复杂性，并强调了持续研究的必要性。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Pos2Distill的位置到位置知识蒸馏框架，以解决位置偏差问题。该方法通过将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置来减少性能差距。实验结果表明，Pos2Distill在长上下文检索和推理任务中实现了更好的均匀性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）显著影响长上下文的理解和处理能力。尽管之前的工作试图通过修改导致其出现的架构来减轻PB，但显著的PB仍然存在。为了有效解决PB，我们引入了Pos2Distill框架。

Method: Pos2Distill是一种位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，它从有利的位置转移到不利的位置，从而减少巨大的性能差距。该概念原理是利用固有的、位置引起的差异来对抗PB本身。

Result: Pos2Distill方法在长上下文检索和推理任务中实现了增强的均匀性和显著的性能提升。两个专门系统展示了强大的跨任务泛化能力，并在各自任务上取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入Pos2Distill方法，我们实现了在长上下文检索和推理任务中所有上下文位置的增强均匀性和显著性能提升。两个专门系统表现出强大的跨任务泛化能力，并在其各自任务上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Conclusion: 本文倡导开发强大的孟加拉语词干提取器，并呼吁继续研究该领域以提高语言分析和处理。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 现有数据集在规模和设计上存在局限，难以系统地研究图像是否总是增强产品理解。

Method: 引入了EcomMMMU数据集，并提出了SUMEI方法，该方法通过预测视觉效用来战略性地利用多张图像。

Result: 分析显示，产品图像并不总能提高性能，有时甚至会降低性能。SUMEI方法在实验中表现出有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 分析表明，产品图像并不总能提高性能，有时甚至会降低性能，这表明MLLMs在利用丰富的视觉内容进行电子商务任务时可能遇到困难。基于这些见解，我们提出了SUMEI，这是一种数据驱动的方法，通过预测视觉效用来战略性地利用多张图像。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Method: Deep-DxSearch is an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL), where the LLM acts as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards for format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy.

Result: Experiments show that Deep-DxSearch consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers, achieving significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy for both common and rare diseases under various settings.

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines and demonstrating the effectiveness of the agentic RAG approach.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 尽管TIR已被提出作为解决LLM在需要精确计算的任务中表现不佳的方法，但其在提高LLM推理能力方面的泛化效果仍不明确。此外，TIR是否改善了模型的推理行为并帮助模型思考仍需研究。

Method: 我们引入了ReasonZoo，一个涵盖九种不同推理类别的全面基准，以评估TIR在各种领域的有效性。此外，我们提出了两个新的指标，Performance-Aware Cost (PAC) 和 Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC)，以评估推理效率。

Result: 我们的实证评估表明，TIR启用的模型在数学和非数学任务中始终优于非TIR模型。此外，TIR提高了推理效率，这由改进的PAC和AUC-PCC得到证明，表明减少了过度思考和更流畅的推理。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了TIR的领域通用优势及其在复杂推理任务中提升LLM能力的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出LiveMCP-101基准测试，用于评估AI代理在现实世界中使用多种MCP工具解决复杂任务的能力，并发现当前模型存在显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对AI代理在现实、动态场景中有效解决多步骤任务使用多样化MCP工具的基准测试。

Method: 本文提出了LiveMCP-101基准测试，包含101个精心策划的真实查询，并引入了一种新颖的评估方法，利用真实执行计划而非原始API输出进行评估。

Result: 即使是最先进的LLM在LiveMCP-101上的成功率也低于60%，突显了工具编排的重大挑战。详细的消融和错误分析揭示了不同的失败模式和令牌使用的低效性。

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101为评估现实世界代理能力设定了严格的标准，推动了通过工具使用可靠执行复杂任务的自主AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

### [55] [Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语义归一化框架，用于分层叙事知识图谱，以减少注释噪声并提高叙事理解的连贯性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉叙述（如漫画）需要结构化的表示，以捕捉跨多个层次的故事组织中的事件、角色及其关系。然而，符号叙事图常常存在不一致和冗余的问题，这限制了推理和泛化的有效性。

Method: 本文提出了一种分层叙事知识图谱的语义归一化框架。基于认知上合理的叙事理解模型，我们提出了使用词汇相似性和基于嵌入的聚类来合并语义相关的动作和事件的方法。

Result: 在Manga109数据集的注释漫画故事上展示了该框架，将归一化应用于面板级、事件级和故事级图。初步评估显示，语义归一化提高了连贯性和鲁棒性，同时保持了符号透明性。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，规范化是迈向可扩展的、认知启发式的图模型的关键步骤，用于多模态叙事理解。

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

### [56] [Adversarial Attacks against Neural Ranking Models via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15283)
*Amin Bigdeli,Negar Arabzadeh,Ebrahim Bagheri,Charles L. A. Clarke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FSAP is a new attack framework that uses LLMs to create adversarial documents that outperform real ones, posing a significant threat to neural retrieval systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural ranking models (NRMs) are susceptible to adversarial manipulation, and existing approaches rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of documents. FSAP aims to address these limitations by leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: FSAP is a novel black-box attack framework that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-ranking adversarial documents through few-shot prompting, without requiring gradient access or internal model instrumentation. It has two modes: FSAP-IntraQ and FSAP-InterQ.

Result: FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate documents in experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health Misinformation Tracks using four diverse neural ranking models. These adversarial outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability.

Conclusion: FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate documents and pose a realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RAGAN的攻击框架，利用多模态基础模型的能力来生成高质量的假用户资料，以提高数据中毒攻击的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于安全和隐私限制，攻击者通常对目标系统了解有限，因此需要生成具有跨黑盒推荐系统可转移性的资料。然而，在资源受限的情况下生成高质量的资料是具有挑战性的。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为RAGAN的实用攻击框架，利用多模态基础模型的上下文学习能力来增强评论文本的质量。通过演示检索算法和文本风格转换策略来增强朴素的ICL，并通过一个 jailbreaker 和一个指令代理以及一个守护者协同优化来提高攻击的可转移性和隐蔽性。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的全面实验表明，RAGAN实现了最先进的数据中毒攻击性能。

Conclusion: RAGAN能够生成高质量的假用户资料，从而提高数据中毒攻击的效果，并揭示推荐系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: IPIGuard is a defensive task execution paradigm that models agents' task execution as a traversal over a Tool Dependency Graph, reducing unintended tool invocations and enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lack structural constraints on agent behaviors, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors.

Method: IPIGuard models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG).

Result: Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.

Conclusion: IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

### [61] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究评估了推理能力和预算对信心评估准确性的影响，发现信息获取是改进知识密集型任务信心校准的关键瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为问答工具部署时需要稳健的校准以避免过度自信。

Method: 我们系统地评估了推理能力和预算如何影响信心评估的准确性，使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域。

Result: 我们的关键发现挑战了“测试时缩放”范式：虽然最近的推理LLM在评估专家信心方面达到48.7%的准确率，但增加推理预算会损害而不是提高校准。扩展的推理导致系统性过度自信，随着更长的思考预算而恶化，产生递减和负收益。相反，搜索增强生成显著优于纯推理，通过检索相关证据达到89.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，信息获取而非推理深度或推理预算可能是改进知识密集型任务信心校准的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI代理必须在多样化的人类目标和偏好上进行推理和行动，这些目标和偏好不是预先定义的。需要一种框架来处理无限和不断演变的目标空间。

Method: GOOD是一种数据高效、在线的方法，通过与人类的交互提取自然语言形式的目标，并推断自然语言目标的分布。它提示LLM模拟具有不同复杂意图的用户，使用其响应进行候选目标的概率推理。

Result: GOOD在文本-based购物领域和文本操作的模拟家庭机器人环境（AI2Thor）中进行了评估，使用合成用户资料。方法优于没有显式目标跟踪的基线方法，经LLM和人类评估确认。

Conclusion: GOOD在文本-based购物领域和文本操作的模拟家庭机器人环境（AI2Thor）中表现出色，优于没有显式目标跟踪的基线方法。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat 是一个开放源代码、领域特定的 LLM 框架，能够为多汗症提供可信赖和富有同理心的支持，并为其他类似数据和可信度挑战的罕见疾病提供通用方法。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受认知心理学理论启发的多记忆系统（MMS），用于处理历史数据并提高响应质量。实验结果表明该方法有效，并展示了其实际价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法如MemoryBank和A-MEM在存储记忆内容的质量上表现不佳，影响了回忆性能和响应质量。为了更好地构建高质量的长期记忆内容，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 受认知心理学理论启发，设计了一个多记忆系统（MMS），将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，并基于这些片段构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，两者一一对应。在检索阶段，MMS会根据用户的查询匹配最相关的检索记忆单元，然后获取对应的上下文记忆单元作为响应阶段的上下文以增强知识。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，与三种其他方法相比，MMS方法有效。消融研究证实了我们记忆单元的合理性。

Conclusion: 实验结果证明了MMS方法的有效性，同时分析了所选记忆片段数量和存储开销的鲁棒性，展示了其实际价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

TL;DR: DiagECG是一个将时间序列和语言建模相结合的新框架，通过将12导联ECG信号转换为符号标记，使大型语言模型能够处理ECG和自然语言输入。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的自动化方法在跨临床任务泛化和开放性推理支持方面存在困难。

Method: DiagECG通过使用独立于导联的编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，并扩展了LLM的词汇表，使其能够统一处理ECG和自然语言输入。此外，通过在自回归ECG预测任务上进行预训练，使LLM能够利用其原生语言建模能力来建模时间动态。最后，在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行了指令调优。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在各种任务上表现出色，并保持了对分布外设置的泛化能力。实验结果表明了每个组件的有效性，并突显了将符号ECG表示整合到LLM中用于医学推理的潜力。

Conclusion: DiagECG展示了将符号ECG表示整合到大型语言模型中的潜力，有助于提高心血管诊断的自动化水平。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments

Motivation: 大型语言模型的发展依赖于高质量的数据集，而现有的数据生成方法存在效率低、灵活性差等问题。

Method: 提出了一种模块化、基于配置的流水线，结合启发式规则和LLM评估的双重阶段质量标记机制，以自动过滤和评分数据。

Result: 生成的对话数据集结构灵活，支持SFT和DPO等训练任务，并能无缝集成到多种训练流程中。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种高效、可扩展的合成对话数据生成解决方案，显著降低了大型语言模型训练中的数据准备开销。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning, requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy, feature engineering, and hyperparameters, but traditional approaches lack interpretability and recent automated methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning.

Method: LGT employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently optimize configurations through natural language reasoning, using textual gradients as qualitative feedback signals.

Result: Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods, achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Conclusion: LGT demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods, achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

TL;DR: AmbiSQL is an interactive system that detects query ambiguities and improves the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems by clarifying user intent through multiple-choice questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query ambiguity is a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL generation.

Method: AmbiSQL automatically detects query ambiguities and guides users through multiple-choice questions to clarify their intent. It introduces a fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy and incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous questions.

Result: AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL demonstrates significant performance gains and practical usability in addressing query ambiguities in Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

### [70] [Evaluating Knowledge Graph Complexity via Semantic, Spectral, and Structural Metrics for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15291)
*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究分析了CSG在知识图谱链接预测中的表现，发现其不稳定且与性能指标相关性弱，提出了新的结构和语义复杂度度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和比较知识图谱上的链接预测模型需要理解数据集的复杂性，而现有的CSG度量在KG设置中尚未被评估。

Method: 通过引入结构和语义KG复杂度度量进行分析，并评估了CSG在多关系链接预测中的表现。

Result: CSG对参数化高度敏感，且与标准性能指标如MRR和Hit@1的相关性较弱或不一致。而Relation Entropy等度量与MRR和Hit@1表现出强逆相关。

Conclusion: CSG的稳定性和泛化预测能力在链接预测设置中未能保持，强调了需要更稳定、可解释和任务对齐的数据集复杂性度量。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at
