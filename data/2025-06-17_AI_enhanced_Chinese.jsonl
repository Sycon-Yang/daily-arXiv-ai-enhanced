In this paper, we introduce CFBenchmark-MM, a Chinese\nmultimodal financial benchmark with over 9,000 image-question pairs featuring\ntables, histogram charts, line charts, pie charts, and structural diagrams.\nAdditionally, we develop a staged evaluation system to assess MLLMs in handling\nmultimodal information by providing different visual content step by step.\nDespite MLLMs having inherent financial knowledge, experimental results still\nshow limited efficiency and robustness in handling multimodal financial\ncontext. Further analysis on incorrect responses reveals the misinterpretation\nof visual content and the misunderstanding of financial concepts are the\nprimary issues. Our research validates the significant, yet underexploited,\npotential of MLLMs in financial analysis, highlighting the need for further\ndevelopment and domain-specific optimization to encourage the enhanced use in\nfinancial domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new Chinese multimodal financial benchmark called CFBenchmark-MM with over 9,000 image-question pairs is introduced to evaluate the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

While these models have attained high accuracy\nby leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long\nchain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires\ngenerating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process.

Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,\nwhich accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention\nfor the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations\nfor the remaining tokens.

To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework\nbased on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines\nwith complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world\nscenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each\nchoice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our\nbenchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one\nwith immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring\nmodels to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As\npart of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs'\nLTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness\nof our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new benchmark framework for evaluating long-term memory in large language models using interactive fiction games with complex reasoning structures.", "motivation": "There is a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate LLMs' long-term memory abilities.", "method": "A novel benchmark framework based on interactive fiction games with dynamically branching storylines and complex reasoning structures is proposed.", "result": "The constructed dataset and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "conclusion": "The proposed benchmark framework can robustly and reliably assess long-term memory in large language models."}}

The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training.

In this work, {\\it we first\nshow that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it\nalready emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent\nability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects\nreflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained\nmodels. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from\n0.6\\% to 18.6\\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our\nanalysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned\nmodels maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from\nnon-reflective contexts.

In this paper, we propose\ncontext-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that\ninitializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our\nmethod enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)\nand instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between\nfreezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or\nadapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning\nperformance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained\nknowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM,\nour method exhibits faster convergence, \\emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA,\nand improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong\nbaseline methods.

Existing LMMs typically concatenate\nrepresentation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a\nlarge language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is\nstraightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on\nlarge-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve\nmodality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer\nof text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously\nprovide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model\nresponses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal\nexperience.", "AI": {"tldr": "Stream-Omni is a large language-vision-speech model that improves modality alignments using different methods for vision and speech, demonstrating strong performance on multiple tasks.", "motivation": "To model the relationships between modalities more purposefully for more efficient and flexible modality alignments.", "method": "Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension concatenation for vision-text alignment and a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping for speech-text alignment.", "result": "Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on various benchmarks and can provide intermediate text outputs during speech interaction.", "conclusion": "Stream-Omni demonstrates strong performance across multiple tasks including visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction."}}
