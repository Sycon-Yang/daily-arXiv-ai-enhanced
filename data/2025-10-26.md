### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于Transformer的模型DeBERTa-KC，用于自动分类在线科学学习话语中的知识建构水平，并在大量数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种有效的自动分类方法，以识别在线科学学习话语中的知识建构水平，从而支持对认知参与度的评估和自动化工具的开发。

Method: 该研究提出了DeBERTa-KC，这是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习话语中的知识建构（KC）水平。模型对DeBERTa-v3进行了扩展，加入了Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化以解决类别不平衡并提高泛化能力。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC达到了0.836±0.008的宏F1分数，显著优于经典和Transformer基线模型（p<0.01）。结果表明，模型在较高阶的认知参与（如“Explore”和“Negotiate”）方面表现出较强的敏感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型可以有效地捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和开发评估认知参与度的自动化工具提供了可扩展的、有理论依据的方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五种大型语言模型生成的教案，发现模型选择影响可读性，提示框架影响事实准确性和课程一致性，最佳配置是结合可读性优化模型和RACE框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在评估AI生成教案的教育合理性和可用性，以确定最佳模型和提示框架组合。

Method: 本研究评估了五种领先的大型语言模型生成的教案的教育合理性和可用性，并测试了三种结构化提示框架：TAG、RACE和COSTAR。通过四个自动计算指标分析了十五个高中物理主题的教案。

Result: 模型选择对语言可及性影响最大，DeepSeek生成的教案最易读，Claude生成的语言最密集。提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响最大，RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数并具有最高的NGSS课程标准偶然对齐度。所有模型中，学习目标集中在Bloom分类法的“记忆”和“理解”层级，高阶动词有限。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程一致性更多取决于提示框架。最有效的配置是将可读性优化的模型与RACE框架以及物理概念、课程标准和高阶目标的显式检查表相结合。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff通过主动修正机制解决离散扩散模型中的训练-推理差异问题，提高生成内容的质量和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉-语言任务中表现出色，但由于训练-推理差异导致初始标记错误引发错误级联，影响生成结果的语法和语义准确性。

Method: 我们将生成过程从被动去噪重新定义为积极修正，引入了ReDiff框架，该框架通过两阶段训练过程：首先教授模型修正合成错误，其次实现在线自我修正循环，让模型通过专家修正学习修正自身错误。

Result: ReDiff在生成内容的一致性和事实准确性方面有显著提升，实现了比传统去噪方法更优的稳定和高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的一致性和事实准确性，使并行生成更加稳定和高效，优于传统的去噪方法。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种名为Stream的新技术，能够高效分析长上下文注意力模式，使得在消费级GPU上实现长上下文可解释性成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型扩展到百万标记的上下文，传统的机制可解释性技术在分析注意力时会随着上下文长度呈二次增长，需要超过100,000个标记的TB级内存。

Method: 我们引入了Sparse Tracing，一种利用动态稀疏注意力来高效分析长上下文注意力模式的新技术。我们提出了Stream，一种可编译的分层剪枝算法，能够在近线性时间O(T log T)和线性空间O(T)内估计每头的稀疏注意力掩码，从而实现大规模的一次性可解释性。

Result: Stream在RULER基准测试中保留了关键的检索路径，同时丢弃了90-96%的交互，并揭示了从针到输出的逐层路径。通过在消费级GPU上实现长上下文可解释性，Sparse Tracing提供了一种实用的现成工具，用于分析注意力模式和跟踪信息流。

Conclusion: 我们的方法使在消费级GPU上实现长上下文可解释性成为可能，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本的管道，以确定患者是否适合进一步进行HIV检测。实验结果表明，该管道在保持低假阴性率的同时达到了高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效筛查和早期诊断HIV对于减少传播至关重要。尽管大规模实验室测试不可行，但电子健康记录（EHR）的广泛采用为解决这一挑战提供了新机会。现有研究主要集中在应用机器学习方法对结构化数据（如患者人口统计信息）进行改进，但这些方法常常忽略了临床笔记等非结构化文本数据，而这些数据可能包含与HIV风险相关的重要信息。

Method: 本研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析非结构化电子健康记录（EHR）文本的管道，以确定患者是否适合进一步进行HIV检测。

Result: 在埃拉斯谟大学医学中心鹿特丹的临床数据上进行的实验结果表明，该管道在保持低假阴性率的同时达到了高准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的管道，利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析非结构化电子健康记录（EHR）文本，并确定患者是否适合进一步进行HIV检测。实验结果表明，该管道在保持低假阴性率的同时达到了高准确性。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了十一个通用LLMs在22个与LCA相关的任务中的表现，并通过168份专家评审分析了它们的科学准确性、解释质量、稳健性、可验证性和对指令的遵守情况。结果表明，37%的回答包含不准确或有误导性信息，而幻觉率差异显著，一些模型产生幻觉引用的比率高达40%。开放权重模型在某些标准上表现优于或与封闭权重模型相当。这些发现突显了在LCA中天真地应用LLMs的风险，同时也显示了好处，尤其是在解释质量和减轻简单任务的劳动强度方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能（AI），特别是大型语言模型（LLMs），正在被越来越多地探索作为支持生命周期评估（LCA）的工具。尽管在环境和社会领域都有演示，但关于其可靠性、稳健性和可用性的系统证据仍然有限。这项研究提供了第一个基于专家的LLMs在LCA中的基准，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估框架的问题，因为在该领域中没有明确的地面真相或共识协议。

Method: 我们评估了十一个通用LLMs，跨越商业和开源家族，在22个与LCA相关的任务中。十七位经验丰富的从业者根据与LCA实践直接相关的标准审查了模型输出，包括科学准确性、解释质量、稳健性、可验证性和对指令的遵守情况。我们收集了168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判断37%的回答包含不准确或有误导性信息。许多模型的准确性评分和解释质量通常被评为平均或良好，甚至较小的模型也是如此，格式遵循性通常被评为有利。幻觉率差异显著，一些模型产生幻觉引用的比率高达40%。在开放权重和封闭权重LLMs之间的评分上没有明确的区别，开放权重模型在准确性、解释质量等标准上表现优于或与封闭权重模型相当。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LCA中天真地应用LLMs的风险，例如当LLMs被视为自由形式的预言时，同时也显示了好处，尤其是在解释质量和减轻简单任务的劳动强度方面。在没有接地机制的情况下使用通用LLMs存在...

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出通过Dixit游戏评估多模态大语言模型的能力，结果表明该方法能有效评估模型并发现其改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法无法全面评估多模态大语言模型的能力，且存在主观性、成本高和模型可能利用表面技巧等问题。

Method: 提出基于游戏的评估方法，具体通过Dixit游戏来评估多模态大语言模型的能力。

Result: Dixit游戏的胜率排名与主流多模态大语言模型基准完美相关，同时揭示了人类和模型玩家之间的策略差异以及模型推理的改进空间。

Conclusion: 通过Dixit游戏评估，可以有效地全面评估多模态大语言模型的能力，并揭示模型在推理方面的改进空间。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在运筹学中的应用，特别是DeepSeek-R1在减少幻觉和提高公式准确性方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专业知识将现实问题转化为可解决的数学模型，而大型语言模型（LLMs）如DeepSeek-R1能够通过自然语言理解和代码生成来弥合这一建模差距。然而，之前模型如GPT-4、Claude和Bard在供应链场景中由于高token成本和幻觉倾向而限制了实际应用。

Method: 本研究的方法包括基线评估、幻觉分类法的开发以及应用LLM-as-a-Judge、少样本学习（FSL）、工具调用和多代理框架等缓解策略。

Result: 本研究评估了DeepSeek-R1在四个关键运筹学基准测试中的表现，并通过各种策略减少了幻觉，提高了公式准确性，并更好地与用户意图对齐模型输出。

Conclusion: 本研究系统评估了DeepSeek-R1在四个关键运筹学基准测试中的表现，包括NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR。通过基线评估、幻觉分类法的开发以及应用LLM-as-a-Judge、少样本学习（FSL）、工具调用和多代理框架等缓解策略，旨在减少幻觉、提高公式准确性，并更好地与用户意图对齐模型输出。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于记忆的框架，通过利用标记数据和LLM生成的批评，提高了目标分类函数的学习效果，并揭示了不同模型在处理事实导向和偏好数据时的行为差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如微调通常成本高、不灵活且不透明，因此我们需要一种更有效的方法来让基于预训练大型语言模型的代理从标记示例中学习目标分类函数，而无需参数更新。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于记忆的框架，该框架利用标记数据和LLM生成的批评。该框架使用情景记忆存储实例级批评，并使用语义记忆将这些批评提炼为可重用的任务级指导。

Result: 在各种任务中，结合批评的框架比仅依赖标签的基于检索的基线（RAG风格）提高了高达24.8%的准确性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究突显了基于记忆的、反思性学习在构建更适应和可解释的LLM代理方面的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR is a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that uses an adaptive curriculum strategy to improve translation quality and reduce training steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for lyric translation often rely on hand-crafted rules and sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize musical-linguistic patterns and generalize effectively at the paragraph level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial.

Method: LyriCAR is a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that operates in a fully unsupervised manner. It introduces a difficulty-aware curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy to ensure efficient allocation of training resources, accelerate convergence, and improve overall translation quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.

Conclusion: LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines. The adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40% while maintaining superior performance.

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合方法，结合了大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛覆盖语言处理能力和符号化自然语言理解（NLU）的能力，以提高在提取和解释常识科学文本中的数量和因果定律任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）具有广泛的应用，但它们依赖于概率推理，容易产生错误，如生成事实的幻觉和自然语言理解（NLU）任务中输出结构的不一致。相比之下，符号化NLU系统提供了基于精心策划的词典、语义资源和句法及语义解释规则的可解释理解。然而，符号化NLU系统在覆盖范围上往往不如LLMs，并且需要稀缺的知识表示和语言学技能来扩展和维护。

Method: 本文提出了一种混合方法，利用LLMs进行重写和文本简化以提供广泛的覆盖，并作为填补知识差距的来源。同时，使用符号化NLU来生成可用于推理和增量学习的表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，混合方法在提取和解释常识科学文本中的数量和因果定律任务上显著优于符号化-only管道。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了一种混合方法，将大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛覆盖语言处理能力与符号化自然语言理解（NLU）的能力相结合，以期获得两者的优点。实验结果表明，该混合方法在提取和解释常识科学文本中的数量和因果定律任务上显著优于符号化-only管道。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在开发一种更符合人类大脑解析特性的自然语言处理算法。

Method: 该算法通过逐词处理，将每个单词尽快附加到依赖树中，类似于人类大脑中的解析过程。

Result: 该算法的最坏情况复杂度为$O(n^3)$，但在人类语言中，最坏情况仅在小$n$时发生。

Conclusion: 该算法为自然语言句子解析提供了基础，能够将每个单词尽快附加，对应于人类大脑中解析器的特性。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

Motivation: 许多医学数据集，如MedQA，依赖于简化的问答，这不能代表现实世界的临床决策。因此，我们需要一个更全面的范式来评估临床决策任务。

Method: 我们提出了一个统一的范式，将临床决策任务沿两个维度进行表征：临床背景和临床问题。然后我们总结了现有数据集和基准设置，并回顾了处理临床决策的方法，包括训练时间和测试时间技术。最后，我们将评估扩展到效率和可解释性。

Result: 我们总结了现有数据集和基准设置，并回顾了处理临床决策的方法。我们还扩展了评估范围，包括效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: 我们的范式明确了假设，标准化了比较，并指导了具有临床意义的LLM的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的希腊语Transformer模型家族，通过高质量的数据整理和多种现代架构的预训练，有效提升了希腊语自然语言处理的性能，特别是在法律领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于研究环境碎片化、架构多样性不足以及依赖有限上下文长度模型，现代希腊语等形态丰富的中等资源语言的自然语言处理进展受到阻碍。特别是在法律等高价值领域，现有模型通常局限于早期的Transformer架构，其512个标记窗口不足以分析长篇法律文件。

Method: 本文构建了多个大规模希腊语语料库，并采用严格的质量过滤和预处理方法，从通用领域和专业法律来源中创建高质量的训练数据集。在此基础上，预训练并系统评估了一系列现代架构，如ELECTRA、ConvBERT和ModernBERT，并提出了第一个针对法律领域的双语希腊语-英语嵌入模型。

Result: 通过广泛的实验，新一类模型证明了所提方法的有效性，GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型在下游任务中表现优异，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 本文提出的新型模型在下游任务中表现出色，证明了所提出方法的有效性，特别是GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: 这篇博士论文通过引入多任务模型、架构修改和生成式监督上下文微调框架，提高了序列标注任务的迁移学习效果，证明了预训练神经语言模型在经过针对性迁移学习后能够达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文旨在提高序列标注任务的迁移学习效果，通过适应预训练神经语言模型来实现这一目标。

Method: 论文提出了三种改进迁移学习的方法：引入多任务模型以结合额外信号；基于自回归大语言模型的架构修改方法；以及利用监督上下文微调和响应导向适应策略的自回归大语言模型序列标注框架。

Result: 论文提出的模型、方法和框架在序列标注任务上表现出色，证明了预训练神经语言模型在经过针对性迁移学习后能够达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过有针对性的迁移学习范式，预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务上可以达到最佳性能。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

*Marianne Menglin Liu,Daniel Garcia,Fjona Parllaku,Vikas Upadhyay,Syed Fahad Allam Shah,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ToolScope，通过减少冗余和优化工具选择，显著提升了LLM在使用外部工具时的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）代理依赖外部工具来解决复杂任务，但现实世界中的工具集常常包含具有重叠名称和描述的冗余工具，这会引入歧义并降低选择准确性。此外，LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效地考虑大型工具集。

Method: 提出了ToolScope，包括两个组件：(1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction用于自动审核和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever用于对每个查询进行排序和选择最相关的工具，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制而不牺牲准确性。

Result: 在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，ToolScope显示了8.38%到38.6%的工具选择准确率提升。

Conclusion: ToolScope的有效性在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中得到了验证，显示出8.38%到38.6%的工具选择准确率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

TL;DR: 本研究通过构建一个孟加拉语文化知识数据集，发现多语言模型在文化知识方面存在不足，但提供上下文可以显著提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近的多语言基准测试已经推动了对语言模型的文化评估，但在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面仍然存在关键差距。

Method: 我们构建了一个包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和区域方言的孟加拉语文化知识(BLanCK)数据集，并对多种多语言语言模型进行了调查。

Result: 研究发现，这些模型在非文化类别中表现良好，但在文化知识方面显著困难，当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了上下文感知架构和文化定制训练数据在提高模型文化知识理解方面的关键作用。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

TL;DR: 本研究通过使用RLAIF和DPO来提高通用波斯语语言模型的推理能力，取得了显著成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业应用（如医学问答）中，增强小型语言模型的推理能力对于像波斯语这样的非主流语言尤为重要。

Method: 我们采用了强化学习与人工智能反馈（RLAIF）和直接偏好优化（DPO）来提高通用波斯语语言模型的推理能力。我们将多选医学问答数据集翻译成波斯语，并使用RLAIF生成被拒绝的首选答案对，这对于DPO训练至关重要。通过提示教师和学生模型生成思维链（CoT）推理响应，我们编制了一个包含正确和错误推理轨迹的数据集。

Result: 所得到的模型在波斯语医学推理方面表现优于其前身gaokerena-V，尽管它利用了更小的数据集。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了以推理为重点的训练方法在开发数据可用性有限的领域特定语言模型方面的效率和有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CreativityPrism的评估框架，用于全面评估大语言模型（LLMs）的创造力。该框架将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，并包含九个任务、三个领域和二十个评估指标。评估结果显示，专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距，且不同任务和领域的性能相关性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法仍然碎片化，由于对创造力的不同定义和测量方式，导致在不同领域和任务之间存在显著差异。我们受到创造力不是单一固定概念的假设的启发，因此提出了一个全面的评估框架。

Method: 我们提出了CreativityPrism，这是一个评估分析框架，将创造力分解为三个维度：质量、新颖性和多样性。CreativityPrism包含了九个任务、三个领域（发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理）和二十个评估指标，这些指标以任务特定的方式测量每个维度。

Result: 我们在CreativityPrism上评估了17个最先进的专有和开源LLM，并分析了不同指标和任务领域之间的性能相关性。结果显示，专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。总体而言，同一领域内的任务性能高度相关，而不同领域之间的相关性较低。在评估维度中，多样性和质量指标显示出强相关性，而新颖性与两者之间的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果支持了我们的假设，即在一个创造力任务或维度上的强表现不一定能推广到其他任务或维度，强调了对LLM创造力进行全面评估的必要性。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER is an efficient Entity Linking method that uses a structured pipeline to achieve high performance without deep fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods while being more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Entity Linking methods require large annotated datasets and extensive model fine-tuning. Recent few-shot methods using LLMs are inefficient due to expensive LLM-based reasoning.

Method: ARTER uses a structured pipeline that combines candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning. It computes complementary signals over retrieved candidates to categorize mentions into easy and hard cases, which are then handled by different methods.

Result: ARTER outperforms ReFinED by up to +4.47% and has an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets. It performs comparably to LLM-based pipelines while being twice as efficient in terms of LLM tokens.

Conclusion: ARTER achieves high performance in Entity Linking without deep fine-tuning, outperforms ReFinED, and is more efficient in terms of LLM tokens.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoundRL 是一种用于处理复杂结构化文本的新方法，通过 token 级别分割和标签预测实现高效推理，并在小模型上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本的复杂性增加，传统的句子或段落级分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: BoundRL 结合了 token 级别的文本分割和标签预测，通过生成起始标记并从原始文本中定位这些标记来重建完整内容，从而减少推理成本并最小化幻觉。此外，它使用了基于可验证奖励的强化学习 (RLVR) 和中间候选生成来优化文档重建精度和语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL 使小型语言模型 (1.7B 参数) 在复杂提示任务上超越了大型模型的少样本提示。此外，基于设计奖励的 RLVR 显著优于监督微调，而引入中间候选进一步提高了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL 是一种有效的文本分割方法，能够处理复杂的结构化文本，并在小语言模型上表现出色。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在零样本设置下的立场检测偏见，并发现它们在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在许多自然语言处理任务中对某些社会群体表现出偏见，而立场检测方法中的这种偏见评估却被社区忽视。立场检测涉及将陈述标记为针对特定目标的反对、支持或中立，是敏感的NLP任务，因为它通常与政治倾向有关。

Method: 研究人员通过自动标注现有立场检测数据集中的帖子，以两种属性（特定群体的方言或俗语和文本复杂度/可读性）来调查这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究发现大型语言模型在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂性相关联，并将非裔美国人口音与反对唐纳德·特朗普相关联。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Method: 我们提出了两种方法来转换现有的数据集，从而产生了一个精心挑选的220个问题的集合，涵盖15个不同的领域。

Result: 即使最先进的代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率也只有2.39%，这表明在信息搜索任务中整合深度和广度搜索具有相当大的挑战性。此外，我们的错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出，暴露了当前代理架构的关键限制。

Conclusion: 我们公开发布DeepWideSearch以促进未来更强大和稳健的信息搜索代理的研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多智能体框架Mixture-of-Minds，用于表格推理任务，通过结合结构化工作流和强化学习，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在表格推理任务中存在局限性，例如基于微调的方法容易出现算术错误和幻觉，而基于工具的方法依赖于刚性模式并缺乏语义理解。因此需要一种结合强大推理和可靠表格处理的方法。

Method: 我们提出了Mixture-of-Minds，这是一个多智能体框架，将表格推理分解为三个专业角色：规划、编码和回答。此外，我们引入了一个自我改进训练框架，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）展开生成伪黄金轨迹，并通过强化学习（RL）优化智能体。

Result: Mixture-of-Minds在TableBench上达到了62.13%的性能，并超过了OpenAI-o4-mini-high。

Conclusion: 这些结果展示了将结构化的多智能体工作流与强化学习相结合的潜力，以推进表格理解。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探索大型语言模型在文本输入上的空间推理能力，并揭示其在处理结构化网格环境中的多步骤问题解决时的局限性。

Method: 本文通过五项任务来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本输入上的空间推理能力，包括象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动。每个任务都通过增加网格尺寸来提高复杂度，以测试模型是否能够超越简单的模式识别进行抽象空间推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然大型语言模型在小规模任务中表现出中等成功，但随着复杂度增加，性能迅速下降，平均准确率损失达到42.7%，最高可达84%。所有起始准确率超过50%的测试都显示出至少48%的损失，说明性能下降具有普遍性。

Conclusion: 本文指出大型语言模型在空间推理任务中的表现随着复杂度增加而显著下降，表明其底层架构缺乏稳健的空间表示。同时，本文强调了语言和空间推理之间的差距，并为未来结合语言与几何的基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

Motivation: 传统的边缘化方法需要对每个样本进行昂贵的生成步骤，这限制了可以获取的样本数量，从而影响了近似的准确性。本文旨在寻找一种更高效的方法来近似边缘化。

Method: 本文研究了无需解码的采样策略，这些策略不需要从语言模型中生成文本，而是依赖于极其廉价的采样策略，与模型和分词器无关。

Result: 实验结果表明，无需解码的采样策略可以在很小的运行时间成本下提供足够准确的边缘估计，并在一些下游推理任务中得到了验证。

Conclusion: 本文研究了无需解码的采样策略，发现它们可以在很小的运行时间成本下提供足够准确的边缘估计，并在一些下游推理任务中进行了验证。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

*Filippo Cenacchi,Deborah Richards,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种三模态情感严重程度框架，用于同时评估抑郁症和PTSD，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号，提高了诊断的准确性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症和PTSD常共存且症状相关，自动化评估通常为二元且特定于疾病，无法满足临床诊断对严重程度感知的跨疾病估计和决策支持解释的需求。

Method: 本文采用三模态数据（访谈文本、音频和面部信号）进行同步和融合，通过校准的晚期融合分类器输出每个疾病的概率和特征级归因。

Result: 该三模态情感融合方法在DAIC衍生语料库上进行了验证，结果表明其在准确性和加权F1分数上与最强的单模态基线相当，并提高了决策曲线效用和鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并提高了类别一致性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，用于同时评估抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍（PTSD），并展示了其在多疾病共存评估中的有效性。该方法在准确性、加权F1分数以及在噪声或缺失模态下的稳健性方面优于单模态/消融基线。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM is a framework that enhances language models by predicting multi-token contexts, leading to better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to overcome the limitation of token-level prediction in capturing higher-level semantic structures and long-range contextual relationships.

Method: introduce ContextLM, a framework that augments standard pretraining with an inherent next-context prediction objective.

Result: ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both perplexity and downstream task performance on GPT2 and Pythia model families scaled up to 1.5B parameters.

Conclusion: next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 本文研究了引用失败问题，并提出了一种新的框架CITENTION来提高LLM的引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引用失败是指模型生成有用响应但未能引用完整证据的情况。与之前的工作不同，我们旨在将引用失败与响应失败区分开来，其中响应本身有缺陷，引用完整证据是不可能的。

Method: 本文采用两步方法解决引用失败问题：(1) 研究引用失败发生的时间；(2) 如何缓解它。首先，我们扩展了之前的工作，研究响应与证据之间的关系如何影响引用质量。我们引入了CITECONTROL基准，系统地变化这种关系以分析失败模式。然后，我们提出了CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和检索的方法来提高引用性能。

Result: 实验表明，随着关系复杂性的增加，失败率上升，并且结合引用方法可以提高性能，这促使了第二步的实施。CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL和转移设置中表现出显著的引用改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为CITENTION的框架，该框架整合了生成式、基于注意力和检索的方法，以提高LLM的引用效率。实验结果表明，在CITECONTROL和转移设置中都取得了显著的引用改进。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PRMs在涉及半结构化数据的任务（如TQA）中的适用性，因为PRMs在数学等领域的有效性已得到验证，但在TQA中的表现尚未研究。

Method: 对最先进的生成PRMs进行评估，从答案和步骤两个角度分析其在TQA中的表现。

Result: PRMs结合文本和代码验证可以辅助解决方案选择，但在泛化到域外数据时遇到困难。步骤级验证性能与答案准确性之间的相关性较弱，可能由于步骤依赖性弱和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在TQA任务中存在局限性，需要构建更鲁棒、过程感知的验证器。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: CoRT is a post-training framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of large reasoning models when using computational tools like Code Interpreters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of large reasoning models when handling complex mathematical operations by integrating computational tools effectively.

Method: CoRT uses a post-training framework that includes Hint-Engineering, a data synthesis strategy that injects hints into reasoning paths, and employs rejection sampling and reinforcement learning to refine the interaction between models and external tools.

Result: CoRT achieves absolute improvements of 4% and 8% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. It also reduces token usage by approximately 30% for the 32B model and 50% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: CoRT is an effective post-training framework that improves the performance and efficiency of large reasoning models when using computational tools like Code Interpreters.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

TL;DR: This paper investigates dataset contamination in LLM evaluations and finds that LLMs may memorize datasets rather than genuinely reason over them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of dataset contamination in evaluating LLMs' ability to reason over structured data.

Method: Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks.

Result: Contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing strong semantic cues, while performance declines to near-random levels when such cues are removed or randomized.

Conclusion: LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

Motivation: 现有的分块方法在固定粒度范式下运作，依赖于静态边界识别，限制了它们对不同查询需求的适应性。

Method: FreeChunker是一种跨粒度编码框架，它将句子视为基本单元，并从静态分块分割转变为灵活的检索支持任意句子组合。

Result: FreeChunker显著减少了语义边界检测所需的计算开销，并提高了对复杂查询的适应性。在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker在检索性能和计算效率方面都优于传统分块方法和现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker在LongBench V2上的实验评估表明，它在检索性能和计算效率方面都优于传统分块方法和现有方法。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Motivation: The impact of negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored.

Method: We investigate whether LLMs can recognize contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with negated expressions.

Result: Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been

contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu

Motivation: 尽管BERT模型在各种任务中表现出色，但其架构相比更新的基于Transformer的模型（如Llama3和Qwen3）已经过时。为了缩小这一差距，提出了ModernBERT和NeoBERT等架构。

Method: NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual是基于NeoBERT架构的BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行训练。

Result: NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在几乎所有的希伯来语基准测试中表现优于现有模型，并且NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在检索任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual模型在希伯来语基准测试中表现优于现有模型，并为下游任务提供了坚实的基础。特别是，NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在检索任务中表现出色，超过了其他相似规模的多语言模型。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Motivation: 多轮对话中的连贯性是一个重要的属性，即对话者之间的及时、直接和有意义的交流。然而，BabyLM在这一方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 引入了ContingentChat，这是一个教师-学生框架，用于基准测试和提高在100M词上训练的BabyLM的多轮连贯性。使用了一个新的对齐数据集进行后训练，BabyLM生成的回应更加语法正确和连贯。

Result: 实验表明，使用自适应教师解码策略仅带来了有限的额外收益。ContingentChat表明，有针对性的后训练可以提高对话质量。

Conclusion: ContingentChat展示了针对对话质量的后训练方法的好处，并表明连贯性仍然是BabyLM的一个挑战性目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法难以有效增强低质量数据，且评估这些技术的方法定义不明确。因此，我们需要一种新的方法来处理低质量数据，以提高指令调优的LLMs的效率和性能。

Method: 我们引入了一个全面的数据构造流程来创建MIXTURE数据集，并提出了LM-Mixup方法，通过监督微调和强化学习优化，使用三种互补的奖励信号进行Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)。

Result: LM-Mixup在多个基准测试中表现出色，仅使用约3%的整个数据集的蒸馏数据进行微调，就能超越全数据集训练，并与最先进的高质量数据选择方法竞争。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，当通过LM-Mixup适当提炼和增强时，低质量数据是一种有价值的资源，显著提高了指令调优的LLMs的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出具有不同水平的不确定性，这影响了它们的实际可靠性。因此，需要评估不同的不确定性估计方法以提高可靠性。

Method: 本文系统评估了四种不确定性估计方法：VCE、MSP、Sample Consistency 和 CoCoA，并在四个问答任务上进行了实验。

Result: 结果表明，每种不确定性度量捕捉了模型信心的不同方面，其中混合的 CoCoA 方法总体上表现最佳，提高了正确答案的校准和区分度。

Conclusion: 本文讨论了四种不确定性估计方法在大型语言模型输出中的表现，并推荐了在实际应用中选择不确定性度量的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Method: 我们提出了改进的掩码语言模型（MLM），根据模型预测被掩码标记的能力调整其概率，并引入子词嵌入以提高模型的形态泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，改进的MLM在(Super)GLUE任务上的性能有显著提升，子词嵌入也提高了模型的形态泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们的提交在严格的小规模赛道中击败了基线。

Abstract: We describe our strategy for the 2025 edition of the BabyLM Challenge. Our
main contribution is that of an improved form of Masked Language Modeling
(MLM), which adapts the probabilities of the tokens masked according to the
model's ability to predict them. The results show a substantial increase in
performance on (Super)GLUE tasks over the standard MLM. We also incorporate
sub-token embeddings, finding that this increases the model's morphological
generalization capabilities. Our submission beats the baseline in the
strict-small track.

TL;DR: RECALL是一种新的表示感知模型合并框架，用于持续学习，无需历史数据，能够有效保持领域通用特征并适应任务特定需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要任务标签或导致性能权衡，而RECALL旨在实现无缝多领域集成和强大的灾难性遗忘抵抗能力。

Method: RECALL是一种基于表示的模型合并框架，通过层间隐藏表示计算模型间的相似性，并进行自适应、分层的参数融合以对齐知识。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多个持续学习场景中，RECALL在知识保留和泛化方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一种可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于演进大型语言模型。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过激活引导来抑制大型语言模型的评估意识，使其在评估时表现得像部署时一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）有时会在被评估时检测到并调整行为以显得更符合规范，这会损害安全评估的可靠性。我们需要一种方法来抑制评估意识，使模型在评估时表现得像部署时一样。

Method: 我们通过一个两步训练过程训练了一个LLM以表现出评估意识行为，然后使用专家迭代来训练模型在评估环境中使用Python类型提示。此外，我们使用原始模型构建了引导向量来抑制评估意识。

Result: 我们发现激活引导可以抑制评估意识，并使模型在存在评估提示时表现得像部署时一样。此外，评估意识的行为可以通过移除评估提示来观察。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，AI评估者可以通过引导模型表现得像部署时一样来提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需重新训练的后处理方法Robust Preference Selection (RPS)，用于解决大型语言模型与人类偏好对齐中的偏好覆盖差距问题，并在多种对齐范式中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常通过昂贵的微调来解决偏好覆盖差距问题，但这种方法可能无法推广到多样化的偏好全谱。当用户的请求反映了一个与训练数据中心趋势不同的细微偏好时，模型性能可能会不可预测地下降。

Method: 本文引入了Robust Preference Selection (RPS)，这是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，通过利用方向邻域共识来解决偏好覆盖差距问题。

Result: 在三种不同的对齐范式（DPA、DPO和SFT）上的全面实验表明，RPS在不进行任何模型微调的情况下，在来自空间中欠代表区域的挑战性偏好上实现了高达69%的胜率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个实用且理论基础牢固的解决方案，以提高偏好对齐模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为Hierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration的统一框架，用于异构问答。该框架通过轻量级结构标签将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的层次序列，并通过结构感知迭代收集足够的证据以进行答案合成。实验表明，HSEQ在多个数据集上表现出色，具有三个关键优势：格式无关的统一、引导的预算感知迭代以及证据规范化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and token/tool budgets.

Method: This paper introduces Hierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that linearize documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence with lightweight structural tags, and perform structure-aware iteration to collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands HSeq via structure-respecting actions.

Result: Experiments on HotpotQA (text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1 gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high efficiency.

Conclusion: HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and (3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency and auditability.

HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA

Motivation: 传统的评估大型语言模型政治偏见的方法主要依赖于英语调查，而该研究旨在提供一种基于多语言翻译公平性的替代方法。

Method: 该研究通过比较欧洲议会演讲的翻译质量，分析了大型语言模型的政治偏见。同时，创建了一个新的21路多语种EuroParl数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型语言模型在多语言翻译中的政治偏见，并展示了通过多语言数据集分析这种偏见的潜力。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为ARC-Encoder的上下文压缩技术，能够在不损害模型通用能力的情况下提高推理效率，并支持多种解码器LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文压缩技术通常需要微调目标模型或修改其架构，这可能会影响模型的通用能力。因此，本文探索了一种替代方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为ARC-Encoder的可调节文本表示压缩器，它将上下文压缩为连续表示，替代解码器LLM中的词嵌入。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个LLM使用场景中表现出色，并提高了推理时的计算效率。此外，该模型可以同时适应多个解码器，实现跨不同解码器LLM的泛化。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一种灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于与多个LLM无缝工作的便携式编码器。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench is a dataset designed to evaluate whether language models understand syntax or rely on semantic patterns. The study shows that models' performance gaps increase with complexity, indicating they shift from structural analysis to pattern matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish structural understanding from semantic pattern matching in language models, as current benchmarks lack methods for this distinction.

Method: Introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720 comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences with syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterparts, and test six models to analyze performance gaps between plausible and implausible sentences.

Result: Performance gaps between plausible and implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points. Semantic plausibility harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where causal relationships matter more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve accuracy but show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer refusal. Humans show variable semantic effects.

Conclusion: CenterBench provides the first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to pattern matching.

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在多跳问答任务中受到两个基本限制：缺乏全局规划来构建多步骤推理，以及不可靠的执行，这阻碍了有效的查询制定和一致使用检索到的证据。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理以及迭代精炼证据来增强多跳问答中的全局推理。引入了Planning Quality Reward和SubGoal Completion Reward，以鼓励连贯的规划和可靠的子目标执行，并采用渐进式权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向的目标。

Result: 在域内和域外基准测试中进行的大量实验表明，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线，仅使用8k训练数据（比强基线使用的训练数据少42%），在EM和F1上平均提高了14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG显著优于强基线，仅使用8k训练数据（比强基线使用的训练数据少42%），在EM和F1上平均提高了14.2%。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Motivation: 现有的检索-排序范式在电商搜索中存在局限性，如复杂查询中的语义差距、跨平台信息获取带来的高决策成本以及缺乏专业购物指导。

Method: 本文提出了多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），将范式从被动检索转变为积极的决策支持。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面有显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。在线A/B测试也证实了其实际效果。

Conclusion: 本文展示了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电子商务搜索方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

Conclusion: 本文结论表明，基于ChatGPT的自动化编码在性别和种族群体之间没有显著偏差，为大规模评估协作和沟通提供了可行的方案。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in

Result: 研究发现，英语推理轨迹表现出更高的认知行为，并且在最终答案准确性方面通常优于其他语言的推理。然而，这种以英语为中心的策略容易出现“翻译迷失”的问题，即翻译步骤可能导致错误，而这些问题在使用问题本身的语言进行推理时是可以避免的。

Conclusion: 研究发现，英语推理轨迹表现出更高程度的认知行为，并且在最终答案准确性方面通常优于其他语言的推理。然而，这种以英语为中心的策略容易出现“翻译迷失”的问题，即翻译步骤可能导致错误，而这些问题在使用问题本身的语言进行推理时是可以避免的。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

*Junghyun Min,York Hay Ng,Sophia Chan,Helena Shunhua Zhao,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CantoNLU, a benchmark for Cantonese NLU, and evaluates different models for Cantonese language processing. The results show that Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform better on syntactic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cantonese remains under-resourced due to policy and diglossia. There is a scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese, which hinders research in this area.

Method: We introduce CantoNLU, a benchmark for Cantonese natural language understanding (NLU) that spans seven tasks covering syntax and semantics. We also provide model baseline performance across a set of models: a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch.

Result: Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese domain data is scarce.

Conclusion: Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese domain data is scarce.

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

### [56] [Neural Diversity Regularizes Hallucinations in Small Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20690)
*Kushal Chakrabarti,Nirmal Balachundhar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新方法，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型即使在参数、计算和数据增加的情况下仍然会产生幻觉。我们需要一种方法来减少幻觉率，同时保持模型的准确性。

Method: 我们提出了神经多样性——去相关并行表示——作为减少幻觉率的原理性机制。我们引入了ND-LoRA，结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，并通过消融实验、因果干预和相关性分析验证了神经多样性的作用。

Result: ND-LoRA减少了幻觉，最多减少了25.6%（平均减少了14.6%），而不会降低一般准确性。神经相关性的增加与幻觉的增加相关。不同的任务需要不同量的最优神经多样性。

Conclusion: 我们的结果强调了神经多样性作为扩展的第三个轴——与参数和数据正交——在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

*Bryan Eikema,Anna Rutkiewicz,Mario Giulianelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的最小贝叶斯风险解码方法，通过增强对结果空间结构变化的敏感性，在指令遵循任务中取得了更好的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放性任务中，使用标准相似性实用函数的MBR可能会选择代表模型分布的响应，但相对于具有潜在结构的生成组来说可能不是最优的。

Method: 我们引入了三种轻量级的适应方法，以使MBR对结果空间中的结构变化更敏感。

Result: 我们的方法在结构最优性方面显著优于常见的相似性实用函数。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在现实世界的指令遵循基准测试中表现出色，提高了生成质量。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过用户实验发现，LLM响应的隐私保护质量和有用性在不同用户之间存在较大差异，而代理LLM无法准确反映真实用户的感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了了解用户如何感知LLM响应在隐私敏感场景中的隐私保护质量和有用性，我们进行了这项研究。

Method: 我们进行了一个用户研究，有94名参与者使用PrivacyLens中的90个场景来评估用户对LLM响应的隐私保护质量和有用性的看法。

Result: 我们发现，当评估相同的响应时，用户在隐私保护质量和有用性方面表现出低一致性。此外，五个代理LLM之间有一致性，但每个单独的LLM与用户的评估相关性较低。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，需要进行以用户为中心的研究，以衡量LLM在帮助用户的同时保护隐私的能力。此外，未来的研究可以探索改进代理LLM与用户之间对齐的方法，以更好地估计用户对隐私和效用的感知。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究旨在开发和评估自然语言处理（NLP）方法，以从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶类药物的治疗和毒性信息。通过构建一个包含236份临床笔记的黄金标准数据集，并由领域专家标注相关类别，研究人员比较了基于规则、机器学习、深度学习和大型语言模型（LLM）的NLP方法。结果表明，基于LLM的方法在提取氟嘧啶类药物的治疗和毒性信息方面表现最佳，具有支持肿瘤学研究和药物警戒的巨大潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.

Method: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).

Result: Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1 scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities extraction. LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in toxicities.

Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了LRM作为机器翻译评估者的能力，发现LRM需要定制的评估材料，并存在过度思考和评分机制问题。通过训练LRM在合成的人类思维轨迹上，可以校准其思考过程，从而显著减少思考预算并提高评估性能。

Motivation: 探索LRM作为机器翻译质量评估者的潜力，因为它们在复杂下游任务中的推理能力得到了提升。

Method: 通过训练LRM在合成的人类思维轨迹上，以校准LRM的思考过程。

Result: 实验表明，这种方法大大减少了思考预算（约35倍），同时提高了不同LRM规模（从7B到32B）的评估性能（例如，R1-Distill-Qwen-7B实现了+8.7的相关性点提升）。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了经过高效校准的LRM在推进细粒度自动MT评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型的方法通常专注于高层次任务，如文本生成，而没有针对特定的AI应用。这种方法对于评估负责任的AI维度（如公平性）是不够的。

Method: 本文构建了一个由实际应用驱动的数据集，该数据集通过公平性属性与性别形容词和产品类别相交，生成丰富的标记提示。

Result: 本文展示了如何使用数据来识别大语言模型在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的新方法，并提供了一个具体的资源供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型由于有限的记忆力，在检索密集型任务中会受到遗忘的影响。我们需要一种方法来恢复对过去标记的直接访问。

Method: 我们探索了一系列混合模型，以恢复对过去标记的直接访问。我们结合了滑动窗口注意力和轻量级CNN，以自适应地保留每头的关键KV对。

Result: 我们的方法在检索密集型基准测试中得到了验证，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在检索密集型基准测试中得到了验证，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

Motivation: 为了减少在检索增强生成（RAG）中使用长上下文的计算成本，我们采用软上下文压缩策略，将输入序列转换为较短的连续表示。

Method: 我们开发了一种轻量级且简单的均值池化方法，并研究了训练相同的压缩器以输出多个压缩比率。

Result: 我们的简单均值池化方法在跨领域和跨模型家族、规模和压缩比率的广泛实验中表现最佳，尽管在训练多个压缩比率时有相对较小的下降。

Conclusion: 我们的简单均值池化方法在压缩方法的复杂领域中表现出最强的性能，尽管在训练多个压缩比率时有相对较小的下降。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

Result: 现有检测器的结果常常被误解，其重要性正在减弱。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但其结果应仅作为参考，而不是决定性指标。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

TL;DR: DeEAR is a framework that evaluates speech expressiveness by converting human preferences into an objective score, achieving strong alignment with human perception and improving S2S model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models lack natural expressiveness due to the absence of a reliable evaluation metric.

Method: DeEAR converts human preference for speech expressiveness into an objective score, evaluating speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and Spontaneity.

Result: DeEAR achieves strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples. It also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, improving the expressive score of S2S models.

Conclusion: DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data curation, improving the expressive score of S2S models.

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

Conclusion: 这些结果展示了描述性标题在标签之外的价值，有助于将生物图像与多模态基础模型联系起来。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Result: 本文提出的框架在所有基准测试中都取得了显著的改进，证明了其有效性。同时，强检测能力和改进的幻觉缓解不仅验证了我们的框架，还重新验证了我们关于上下文的假设。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的'induce-detect-suppress'框架，以主动诱导幻觉并通过早期检测和抑制来减少幻觉。该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了显著的改进，验证了我们的假设，并为深入研究LVLMs中的幻觉提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法忽略了跨模态可能产生的语义不一致，并且通常受文本模态主导，这可能会影响识别准确性。

Method: 提出了一种称为校准多模态共识（CMC）的模型，其中包括伪标签生成模块（PLGM）、无参数融合模块（PFM）和多模态共识路由器（MCR）。

Result: CMC在四个数据集上表现优异，特别是在存在语义不一致的情况下。

Conclusion: CMC在四个数据集上取得了与现有最先进方法相当或更好的性能，并在CH-SIMS和CH-SIMS v2中表现出显著的优势。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV是一种训练-free 框架，通过整合多个部分准确的推理路径，实现了错误纠正和成本效率，相比大型专有模型或训练流程具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态理解方面取得了显著进展，但在处理信息密集且文本注释与细粒度图形元素紧密交织的图像时存在困难。主要挑战在于精确定位密集布局中的关键线索以及多跳推理以整合分散的证据。

Method: SV是一种训练-free 框架，结合了多个轻量级草稿专家和一个大型判断模型。在草稿阶段，小型VLM作为草稿专家生成提供多样定位候选的推理路径；在判断阶段，强大的VLM综合这些路径以产生最终答案。SV引入了一种共识专家选择机制，仅将高一致性的推理路径传递给判断模型。

Result: SV在具有挑战性的信息密集型和高分辨率视觉问答基准测试中实现了持续提升，包括InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K。

Conclusion: SV通过整合多个部分准确的推理路径，实现了错误纠正和成本效率，相比大型专有模型或训练流程具有优势。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

### [70] [Prompt Decorators: A Declarative and Composable Syntax for Reasoning, Formatting, and Control in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19850)
*Mostapha Kalami Heris*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Prompt Decorators，一种用于控制大型语言模型行为的声明式语法，通过紧凑的控制标记实现可解释和可重用的提示设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的提示工程依赖于冗长的自然语言指令，限制了可重复性、模块化和可解释性。本文旨在提供一种更有效、可解释和可重用的提示设计接口，以改善用户对大型语言模型行为的控制。

Method: 本文提出了Prompt Decorators，这是一种声明式、可组合的语法，通过紧凑的控制标记来管理大型语言模型的行为。该框架形式化了二十个核心装饰器，分为两个功能家族（认知与生成和表达与系统），并进一步细分为子类别以管理推理、交互、表达和会话控制。

Result: Prompt Decorators通过解耦任务意图和执行行为，实现了可重用和可解释的提示设计接口。实验结果表明，它提高了推理透明度，减少了提示复杂性，并在不同领域中实现了标准化的模型行为。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了Prompt Decorators在提高推理透明度、减少提示复杂性以及在不同领域中标准化模型行为方面的应用。同时，文章强调了其在互操作性、行为一致性和可扩展AI系统开发中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and
decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they
reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose
natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and
interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,
composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such
as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems
Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning
style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework
formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families
(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed
into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and
session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic
processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By
decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a
reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases
demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and
standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with
implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development
of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

TL;DR: Branch-and-Browse 是一种基于 LLM 的网络代理框架，通过结构化推理-行动、上下文记忆和高效执行，提高了任务成功率并减少了执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在推理深度和效率上存在限制，例如线性方法无法处理多步骤推理，缺乏有效的回溯，而其他搜索策略则粗粒度且计算成本高。

Method: Branch-and-Browse 框架通过显式的子任务管理和树状探索、通过背景推理进行高效的网页状态重放以及利用页面操作记忆在会话内外共享已探索的操作，实现了结构化的推理-行动、上下文记忆和高效执行。

Result: 在 WebArena 基准测试中，Branch-and-Browse 实现了 35.8% 的任务成功率，并将执行时间减少了高达 40.4% 相对于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse 是一个可靠且高效的基于 LLM 的网络代理框架。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种利用大型语言模型在文本中隐藏信息的协议，展示了文本与作者意图之间的分离，以及对AI安全的潜在影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，文本与作者意图之间的关系变得模糊，这引发了对AI安全和理解模型知识的挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一种简单而高效的协议，利用大型语言模型实现隐藏信息的嵌入和解码。

Result: 即使使用 modest 的 80 亿参数开源 LLM，也能实现高质量的结果，并且可以在笔记本电脑上快速编码和解码长消息。

Conclusion: 该协议的存在表明了文本与作者意图之间的根本性分离，进一步削弱了对书面交流的信任。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Motivation: 传统反应式聊天机器人无法主动生成符合规范的、用户特定的投资见解，因此需要一种更先进的解决方案来满足零售金融的需求。

Method: AI PB结合了组件化编排层、混合检索管道和多阶段推荐机制，以在韩国金融监管下提供主动的、符合规范的、用户特定的投资见解。

Result: AI PB在24块NVIDIA H100 GPU上运行，通过人类QA和系统指标验证了其在高风险金融中提供可信赖AI见解的能力。

Conclusion: 通过人类QA和系统指标，我们证明了具有显式路由和分层安全性的地面生成可以在高风险金融中提供可信赖的AI见解。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IKnow是一种无需外部资源或原始基础模型的持续适应框架，通过利用文本中的领域知识来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法需要访问原始基础模型或依赖外部领域特定数据库，这在某些情况下不可行。因此，需要一种不需要这些资源的持续适应方法。

Method: IKnow通过利用文本中嵌入的领域知识，并在更深层次的语义层面学习编码它，来形成新的自监督目标。

Result: IKnow能够在不依赖外部资源或原始基础模型的情况下，有效提升模型的指令遵循能力和语义表示。

Conclusion: IKnow是一种简单且通用的框架，通过在指令-响应对话格式中制定新的自监督目标，能够有效地进行持续适应，而无需依赖外部资源或原始基础模型。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估方法CaSE，用于衡量大型语言模型推理过程中的相关性和连贯性，并展示了这种方法在提高模型性能方面的实际价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大型语言模型的方法提供了一个粗略的信号，忽略了底层推理过程的质量。我们主张对推理进行更细致的评估，以构建更强大的模型。

Method: 我们引入了因果逐步评估（CaSE），这种方法仅使用其前面的上下文来评估每个推理步骤，从而避免了后见之明偏差。

Result: 我们在新的专家注释基准MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH上验证了CaSE，并展示了使用CaSE评估的相关性和连贯性来整理训练数据可以直接提高最终任务性能。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于分析、调试和改进LLM推理，并展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究探讨了LLM如何改变用户观点，但很少有研究扩展到双向影响，即用户输入如何影响LLM响应以及这种双向影响如何在多轮对话中表现出来。

Method: 本研究通过50次涉及争议性话题的讨论，涉及266名参与者，分为三种条件：静态陈述、标准聊天机器人和个性化聊天机器人，来调查这种动态。

Result: 结果显示，人类观点几乎没有变化，而LLM输出发生了显著变化，缩小了人类和LLM立场之间的差距。个性化增强了这两种方向上的变化，相较于标准设置。

Conclusion: 我们的工作突显了人机LLM交互中过度对齐的风险，并强调了需要仔细设计个性化聊天机器人，以更周到和稳定地与用户对齐。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

TL;DR: Empathic Prompting is a novel framework that enriches LLM conversations with non-verbal emotional cues, improving conversational smoothness and offering potential applications in healthcare and education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal interfaces require explicit user control, but Empathic Prompting aims to unobtrusively augment textual input with affective information for smoother conversations.

Method: The framework uses a commercial facial expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embed them as contextual signals during prompting, integrating them into LLM outputs without explicit user control.

Result: The system successfully integrated non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with participants noting improved conversational fluidity.

Conclusion: Empathic Prompting demonstrates the potential to enhance human-AI interaction by incorporating non-verbal emotional cues, with applications in domains like healthcare and education.

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该工作旨在解决如何设计具有特定可逆对角门的量子码的问题，并通过系统性的枚举和精确的分析重建来实现大规模的可行性分析。

Method: 该工作提出了一种多智能体、人机协同的工作流程，与指定的可逆对角门共同设计量子码。它基于Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP)框架，利用小的线性规划来划分基字符串并强制执行Z-边缘Knill-Laflamme (KL)等式。工作流程由GPT-5驱动，并在TeXRA平台上实现，该平台支持迭代工具使用循环代理和先推导后编辑的工作流推理代理。

Result: 在距离d=2的情况下，对于代码维度K∈{2,3,4}和n≤6个量子比特，系统性扫描生成了带有证书的表格，记录了可实现的循环逻辑组，所有都是新代码。例如，对于K=3，我们在n=6时获得了阶数16。从验证实例中，合成代理抽象出重复结构并证明它们满足所有参数的KL等式。此外，它还展示了SSLP如何容纳残留退化性，通过展示一个新的((6,4,2))代码实现了可逆的受控相位diag(1,1,1,i)。

Conclusion: 该工作通过结合系统枚举和精确的分析重建，将对角线可逆可行性重新表述为一个可扩展的分析管道。它产生了可重复的代码构造，支持针对更大K和更高距离的扩展，并朝着数据驱动的分类迈进。

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for task-oriented communication, requiring diverse communication strategies for teamwork in complex tasks.

Method: Communication to Completion (C2C), a scalable framework that addresses the gap through two key innovations: (1) the Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions.

Result: C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale.

Conclusion: C2C establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex

The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original
and translated data, and the best QI performance using original, translated,
and minority class data creation. These approaches secured 4th place on the
final leaderboard, with an average F1-score of 0.8857 on the private test set.

### [83] [Every Question Has Its Own Value: Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20187)

TL;DR: RLEV is a method that aligns LLM optimization with human value signals, improving performance and learning a value-sensitive termination policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RLVR effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV aims to address this by aligning LLM optimization directly with quantifiable human value signals.

Method: RLEV extends the RLVR framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the reward function. It uses exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels and employs value-weighted gradient amplification on end-of-sequence tokens.

Result: RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL algorithms and model scales. RLEV policies improve value-weighted accuracy and learn a value-sensitive termination policy: concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones.

Conclusion: RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

### [84] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench 是一个用于评估和研究 LLM 代理如何利用测试用例的基准框架，旨在提高 LLM 系统的可靠性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 代理可能会找到并利用“捷径”来完成任务，这会危及基准结果的有效性和实际部署的可靠性。

Method: ImpossibleBench 通过引入与自然语言规范直接冲突的单元测试，创建了任务的“不可能”变体，以系统地测量 LLM 代理利用测试用例的倾向性。

Result: ImpossibleBench 可以用来研究模型行为、进行上下文工程以及开发监控工具，提供了一个带有已验证欺骗解决方案的测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench 是一个有用的框架，可以帮助构建更稳健和可靠的 LLM 系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

### [85] [Relative-Based Scaling Law for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20387)
*Baoqing Yue,Jinyuan Zhou,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于相对概率的缩放定律，以补充现有的交叉熵视角，从而更全面地理解大型语言模型的缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缩放定律研究几乎完全依赖于交叉熵作为评估指标。然而，交叉熵仅提供了性能的部分视图：它衡量的是分配给正确标记的绝对概率，但忽略了正确和错误标记之间的相对顺序。然而，相对顺序对于语言模型至关重要，例如在贪心采样场景中。为了克服这一限制，我们从相对顺序的角度研究缩放。

Method: 我们首先提出了基于相对概率（RBP）度量，该度量量化了正确标记在顶级预测中的概率。在此基础上，我们建立了基于相对概率的缩放定律，该定律描述了随着模型大小增加，RBP如何改进。

Result: 通过在四个数据集和四个模型家族上的广泛实验，跨越五个数量级，我们展示了该定律的鲁棒性和准确性。最后，我们通过两个例子说明了该定律的广泛应用，即提供对出现现象的更深入解释和促进找到缩放定律的基本理论。

Conclusion: 相对基础的缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，并有助于对缩放大型语言模型有更全面的理解。因此，它为实际开发和理论探索提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

### [86] [BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792)
*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了BadGraph，一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法。通过文本触发器污染训练数据，可以在推理时诱导特定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上表现出高攻击成功率和低污染率，同时揭示了相关模型的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的工作已经探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性尤其是文本引导的图生成仍基本未被研究。因此，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: BadGraph是一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法，它利用文本触发器污染训练数据，从而在推理时当触发器出现时诱导攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（PubChem、ChEBI-20、PCDes、MoMu）上的广泛实验表明，该攻击方法具有有效性和隐蔽性：小于10%的污染率可以实现50%的攻击成功率，而24%的污染率足以实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能降级可以忽略不计。消融研究进一步揭示了后门是在VAE和扩散训练期间植入的，而不是预训练阶段。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在安全漏洞，并强调了在药物发现等应用中的严重风险，同时指出了需要针对此类扩散模型中的后门攻击建立稳健防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

### [87] [Compress to Impress: Efficient LLM Adaptation Using a Single Gradient Step on 100 Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20800)
*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种快速且稳健的LLM下游任务适应算法，无需微调，仅需100个样本和一次梯度步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharma等人提出的LASER方法虽然能提高下游准确率，但其每矩阵搜索需要完整的数据集前向传递，使得它在快速部署中不切实际。因此，我们需要一种更高效的方法来实现类似的效果。

Method: 我们发现只需要检查一小部分精心选择的矩阵，而不是逐层扫描；每个矩阵的奇异值梯度可以指出哪些矩阵值得减少；通过允许矩阵行围绕多个子空间聚类并分别分解每个集群，进一步减少了对原始训练数据的过拟合；此外，仅使用100个样本而不是整个训练数据进行计算指示梯度和测量最终准确性就足够了。

Result: 通过结合这些发现，我们能够以单次梯度步骤和快速扫描顶级候选层和分解技术的方式，将LLM适应到新的数据集，而无需任何微调。

Conclusion: 我们展示了这些发现的结合可以产生一个快速且稳健的下游任务适应算法。总体而言，通过在100个例子上进行一次梯度步骤，并快速扫描顶级候选层和分解技术，我们可以将LLM适应到新的数据集——完全不需要微调。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.
