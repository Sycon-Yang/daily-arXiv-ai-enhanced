Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where\nhigher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the\nreliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction\nhierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first\n\"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority\n(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability\nvia training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of\nconstraint-following tasks with verifiable answers.

We show that lightweight\nreinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning\ncapabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models\nachieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction\nhierarchy benchmarks.

By treating safety\nissues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined\nhigher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against\njailbreak and prompt injection attacks.

Current training sample influence estimation\nmethods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing\ninformation flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order\ngradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of\nbillions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to\nsome subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal\nwork by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for\ncomputing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers\nare the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on\ninfluence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,\nwe propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the\ncancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better\nestimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of\naggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to\nstandard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to\nsignificantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for\nevaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model\nretraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)\nthat exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.\nThrough extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we\nconcretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than\nthe last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior\nknowledge in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4e5f\u79f0\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u9274\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53d6\u6d88\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e2d\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\u805a\u5408\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6392\u540d\u548c\u6295\u7968\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff08NDR\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u6bd4\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5148\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u6bd4\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5148\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

Our work provides a practical pathway for\ndeploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access\nto advanced language understanding capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBudgetMem\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u6863\u3001\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u4e66\u7c4d\u957f\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u5df2\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u6269\u5c55\u5230100K-1M\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BudgetMem\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u5b66\u4e60\u8bb0\u4f4f\u4ec0\u4e48\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8bb0\u4f4f\u6240\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u5b9e\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001TF-IDF\u3001\u8bdd\u8bed\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u6765\u51b3\u5b9a\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u54ea\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u503c\u5f97\u5b58\u50a8\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cBudgetMem\u91c7\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u548cBM25\u7a00\u758f\u68c0\u7d22\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728700\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u957f\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebfRAG\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1.0%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8282\u7701\u4e8672.4%\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u7b97\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd57\u79cd\u9884\u7b97\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u3001\u6734\u7d20\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6587\u6863\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eBudgetMem\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u968f\u7740\u6587\u6863\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u666e\u901a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u66f4\u591a\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These emerging\ncapabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM\nagent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is\nto automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval.\nHowever, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation\ndatasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many\ndatasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content\nsimilarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks\nexperimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the\nbaseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for\nbaseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated\ndata-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted\npapers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a\ncollective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each\ndataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates\nself-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient\ncandidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations.\nFinally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction\nchains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language\nmodel to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset\nwe curated covers 85\\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences\nover the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the\nstrongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\\% in Recall@20, +8.30\\% in\nHitRate@5.

To investigate this, we introduce the Moral\nRolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale\nand a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs\nwith role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our\nlarge-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing\nfidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most\nwith traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''\nand ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial\naggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a\npoor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned\nmodels performing particularly poorly.

However,\nemotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized\nemotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to\nobtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as \"win a prize\" and\n\"be criticized\". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of\nChinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by\nprompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To\nensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard\ninvalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being\npositive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we\nharvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment\npolarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of\nemotional events in Chinese language.

This reality highlights\nthe need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic\nalignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse\nuser values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE\n(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'\ncapacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,\ninteractive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300\nrealistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic\nevaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral\nspecifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that\nleading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral\npolicies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their\ncompliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to\n84% failure rates).

This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark\nestablished for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and\ncompetitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark\ncomprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five\ncomplexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading\nproprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a\none-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against\nhidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even\ntop-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the\nproblems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural\nlanguage. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of\nperformance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of\nsolution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time\nand memory consumption of the generated solutions.

Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large\nlanguage models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating\nthe tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring\npreservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the\nperformance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their\nlinguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a\nhuman benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral\n24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential\narchitectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a\ntempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a\nsuite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),\nwhile preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also\nattains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a\ndisconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a\nstatistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a\ncomprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,\ndiscourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for\nmechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five\nreadability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the\nevolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the\ninstruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics\nfor metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary\ndomain-adaptation issue for simplification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7b80\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684Mistral 24B\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u7bc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u516c\u4f17\u5065\u5eb7\u5bfb\u6c42\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6d88\u8d39\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6587\u6863\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u901a\u4fd7\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u7b80\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u7bc7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684Mistral 24B\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7684QWen2.5 32B\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7b80\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf921\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "result": "Mistral 24B\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7b80\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u5176SARI\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3a42.46\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u8bed\u7bc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cBERTScore\u4e3a0.91\u3002QWen2.5 32B\u4e5f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8131\u8282\uff0cBERTScore\u4e3a0.89\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c21\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6587\u672c\u7b80\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684Mistral 24B\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u8bed\u7bc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u652f\u6301\u662f\u6587\u672c\u7b80\u5316\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, over\nthe last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies\nhave aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word\nrecognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel\nactivation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll\net al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals\nwho speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in\nvarious linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language\nAbu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of\nthe mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak\nmultiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who\ninvestigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental\nlexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by\nDijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer\nnetwork principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design\nextends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex\nmodel, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their\ncorresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the\nmental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language\ninfluences the acquisition of another language.

To\nbetter leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a\nsimple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight\narithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the\nweight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired\nbehavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this\ndirection to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate\nsycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often\ngeneralizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger\nout-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.\nWe also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering\ncan partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and\nunder-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance\ngains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can\nbe detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an\n\"evil\" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the\nevolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that\nnever manifest during training or evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7b97\u672f\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u7ed9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u662f\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7b97\u672f\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u53bb\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u671f\u671b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76f8\u53cd\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u6765\u9694\u79bb\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u6216\u5220\u9664\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6cdb\u5316\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u635f\u5bb3\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u4ee5\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5fae\u8c03\u671f\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5949\u627f\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u201c\u90aa\u6076\u201d\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u5411\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7b97\u672f\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u521d\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u201c\u90aa\u6076\u201d\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u5411\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

To overcome these limitations, the use of\nartificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of\nreports through the processing of images and field data. The methodology was\nbased on the collection of photographs of rock outcrops and manual samples with\ntheir respective descriptions, as well as on the reports prepared during the\nGeotechnical Studies course. These resources were used to define the report\noutline, prompt engineering, and validate the responses of a multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM). The iterative refinement of prompts until structured and\nspecific instructions were obtained for each section of the report proved to be\nan effective alternative to the costly process of fine-tuning the MLLM. The\nsystem evaluation establishes values of 0.455 and 0.653 for the BLEU and\nROUGE-L metrics, respectively, suggesting that automatic descriptions are\ncomparable to those made by experts. This tool, accessible via the web, with an\nintuitive interface and the ability to export to standardized formats,\nrepresents an innovation and an important contribution for professionals and\nstudents of field geology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5730\u8d28\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u4e14\u4e3b\u89c2\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u5ca9\u5c42\u9732\u5934\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7167\u7247\u53ca\u5176\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5730\u8d28\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u62a5\u544a\u5927\u7eb2\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aBLEU\u548cROUGE-L\u6307\u6807\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.455\u548c0.653\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u52a8\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u901a\u8fc7\u7f51\u9875\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u754c\u9762\u548c\u5bfc\u51fa\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5bf9\u73b0\u573a\u5730\u8d28\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Public speaking is a\nnecessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical\nknowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or\nworkshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to\nstudents. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal\naspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and\nindividualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal\nand non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model\nfor engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer\nvision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides\nassessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch,\nloudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial\nexpressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel\nintegration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike\nprevious systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple\nmodalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing\ndemonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert\nevaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro\nemerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human\nannotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public\nspeaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align\ntheir speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and\nprofessional communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6f14\u8bb2\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dGemini Pro\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u590d\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u516c\u5171\u6f14\u8bb2\u662f\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5fc5\u987b\u638c\u63e1\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u4ea4\u6d41\u6280\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6216\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0a\u90fd\u5f88\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff081\uff09\u53e3\u5934\u4ea4\u6d41\uff08\u97f3\u8c03\u3001\u54cd\u5ea6\u3001\u8282\u594f\u3001\u8bed\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\uff082\uff09\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u6d41\uff08\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\uff083\uff09\u8868\u8fbe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8a00\u8bed\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u543b\u5408\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u662f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGemini\u548cOpenAI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dGemini Pro\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6f14\u8bb2\u8bad\u7ec3\u5668\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u590d\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eec\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5c06\u8a00\u8bed\u4e0e\u80a2\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and\nefficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more\nsophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and\ncross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to\nhighlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to\nshow that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this\nissue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709LVLM\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5411\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LVLM\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u9644\u52a0\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u505a\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5411\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709LVLM\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5411\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We study the framework of \\emph{language\ngeneration in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown\nlanguage $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate\nunseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible,\nand that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a\n\\emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve\na main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best\nachievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \\emph{partial\nenumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \\subseteq\nK$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has\nlower density $\\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least\n$\\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the\npartial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor\n$1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical\nGold--Angluin model of \\emph{language identification} under partial\nenumeration.
