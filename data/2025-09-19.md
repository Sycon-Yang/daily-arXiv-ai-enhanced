### [1] [Tokenization Strategies for Low-Resource Agglutinative Languages in Word2Vec: Case Study on Turkish and Finnish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14238)
*Jinfan Frank Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了不同分词策略对土耳其语和芬兰语静态词嵌入质量的影响，发现词级分词在低资源条件下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词在处理屈折语言中起着关键作用，因为单个单词可以编码多个带有句法和语义信息的词素。然而，对于低资源环境下的屈折语言，哪种分词策略最有效尚不明确。

Method: 本研究评估了各种分词策略（词级、字符级、n-gram 和字节对编码 (BPE)）对土耳其语和芬兰语静态词嵌入质量的影响。使用一个包含 10,000 篇文章的维基百科语料库，在低资源条件下训练模型，并在命名实体识别 (NER) 任务上进行评估。

Result: 尽管子词分割在理论上具有吸引力，但词级分词在所有测试的分词策略中始终优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 在低资源的屈折语言环境中，通过词级分词保留边界可能比复杂的统计方法产生更好的嵌入性能。这对于开发资源匮乏语言的自然语言处理流水线具有实际意义。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in processing agglutinative languages,
where a single word can encode multiple morphemes carrying syntactic and
semantic information. This study evaluates the impact of various tokenization
strategies - word-level, character-level, n-gram, and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
- on the quality of static word embeddings generated by Word2Vec for Turkish
and Finnish. Using a 10,000-article Wikipedia corpus, we trained models under
low-resource conditions and evaluated them on a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
task. Despite the theoretical appeal of subword segmentation, word-level
tokenization consistently outperformed all alternatives across all tokenization
strategies tested. These findings suggest that in agglutinative, low-resource
contexts, preserving boundaries via word-level tokenization may yield better
embedding performance than complex statistical methods. This has practical
implications for developing NLP pipelines for under-resourced languages where
annotated data and computing power are limited.

### [2] [Advancing Conversational AI with Shona Slang: A Dataset and Hybrid Model for Digital Inclusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14249)
*Happymore Masoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究为绍纳语创建了一个新的俚语数据集，并开发了一个混合聊天机器人，提高了文化相关性和用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言在自然语言处理（NLP）中仍被低估，大多数语料库仅限于正式的语域，无法捕捉日常交流的活力。为此，本研究针对绍纳语进行了研究，以弥补这一差距。

Method: 本研究为绍纳语引入了一个新的绍纳语-英语俚语数据集，并微调了一个多语言DistilBERT分类器进行意图识别。此外，还开发了一个混合聊天机器人，结合基于规则的响应和检索增强生成（RAG）来处理特定领域的查询。

Result: 该数据集已公开，并用于微调一个准确率达到96.4%的多语言DistilBERT分类器。混合聊天机器人在文化相关性和用户参与度方面优于仅使用RAG的基线系统。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集、模型和方法，这项工作推进了非洲语言的NLP资源，促进了包容性和文化共鸣的对话AI。

Abstract: African languages remain underrepresented in natural language processing
(NLP), with most corpora limited to formal registers that fail to capture the
vibrancy of everyday communication. This work addresses this gap for Shona, a
Bantu language spoken in Zimbabwe and Zambia, by introducing a novel
Shona--English slang dataset curated from anonymized social media
conversations. The dataset is annotated for intent, sentiment, dialogue acts,
code-mixing, and tone, and is publicly available at
https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/Working_with_shona-slang. We fine-tuned a
multilingual DistilBERT classifier for intent recognition, achieving 96.4\%
accuracy and 96.3\% F1-score, hosted at https://huggingface.co/HappymoreMasoka.
This classifier is integrated into a hybrid chatbot that combines rule-based
responses with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle domain-specific
queries, demonstrated through a use case assisting prospective students with
graduate program information at Pace University. Qualitative evaluation shows
the hybrid system outperforms a RAG-only baseline in cultural relevance and
user engagement. By releasing the dataset, model, and methodology, this work
advances NLP resources for African languages, promoting inclusive and
culturally resonant conversational AI.

### [3] [The meaning of prompts and the prompts of meaning: Semiotic reflections and modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14250)
*Martin Thellefsen,Amalia Nurma Dewi,Bent Sorensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从皮尔斯的符号学理论出发，探讨了大型语言模型中的提示现象，认为提示是一种符号学和交际过程，重新定义了知识在数字环境中的组织、搜索、解释和共同构建方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在重新概念化提示，不是将其视为技术输入机制，而是作为涉及符号形成、解释和精炼的迭代过程的交际和认识论行为。

Method: 本文基于皮尔斯的符号学理论，特别是代表符、对象和解释符之间的相互作用，以及符号的类型丰富性（质符、实符、法符；象符、指数、象征；主题、断言、论证）以及Dynacom模型中的解释符三元组，分析了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为符号学资源的角色。

Result: 研究结果表明，提示是一种符号学和交际过程，重新定义了知识在数字环境中的组织、搜索、解释和共同构建方式。

Conclusion: 本文认为提示是一种符号学和交际过程，重新定义了知识在数字环境中的组织、搜索、解释和共同构建方式。这种观点邀请重新设想计算符号学时代的知识组织和信息检索的理论和方法基础。

Abstract: This paper explores prompts and prompting in large language models (LLMs) as
dynamic semiotic phenomena, drawing on Peirce's triadic model of signs, his
nine sign types, and the Dynacom model of communication. The aim is to
reconceptualize prompting not as a technical input mechanism but as a
communicative and epistemic act involving an iterative process of sign
formation, interpretation, and refinement. The theoretical foundation rests on
Peirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object,
and interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign,
legisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the
interpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper
positions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in
response to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared
universes of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and
communicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched,
interpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments. This perspective
invites a reimagining of the theoretical and methodological foundations of
knowledge organization and information seeking in the age of computational
semiosis

### [4] [LLM-JEPA: Large Language Models Meet Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14252)
*Hai Huang,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM-JEPA，一种基于JEPA的语言模型训练方法，能够在多个数据集和模型上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到在视觉领域中，嵌入空间训练目标（如JEPAs）比输入空间目标更优，这引发了语言训练方法是否可以借鉴视觉方法的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于JEPA的解决方案，即LLM-JEPA，适用于LLM的微调和预训练。

Result: LLM-JEPA在多个数据集和不同模型家族中均表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: LLM-JEPA能够显著优于标准的LLM训练目标，并且对过拟合具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on
input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been
observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint
Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their
input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between
language and vision opens up a natural question: {\em can language training
methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is
a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this
work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a
JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining.
Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives
by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting.
Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider,
RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo
families. Code: https://github.com/rbalestr-lab/llm-jepa.

### [5] [CrossPT: Exploring Cross-Task Transferability through Multi-Task Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14253)
*Ahmad Pouramini,Hesham Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrossPT is a modular framework for multi-task prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining task-specific specialization, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing prompt tuning approaches are designed for single-task settings, failing to share knowledge across related tasks.

Method: CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined via a learned attention mechanism.

Result: Empirical results on GLUE and related benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large pre-trained
language models to new tasks, but most existing approaches are designed for
single-task settings, failing to share knowledge across related tasks. We
propose Cross-task Prompt Tuning (CrossPT), a modular framework for multi-task
prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining
task-specific specialization. CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into
shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined
via a learned attention mechanism. To support robust transfer, we
systematically investigate key design factors including prompt initialization,
balancing shared and private prompts, number of source prompts, learning rates,
task prefixes, and label semantics. Empirical results on GLUE and related
benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared
to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource
scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.

### [6] [Hallucination Detection with the Internal Layers of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14254)
*Martin Preiß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LLM内部表示的新幻觉检测方法，并在多个基准测试中进行了评估，结果显示该方法在性能上优于传统方法，但泛化能力仍有待提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种自然语言处理任务中取得了成功，但它们存在明显的局限性，例如生成幻觉，这可能导致严重的现实后果。因此，需要一种有效的方法来检测幻觉，以提高LLM的可靠性。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新的架构，动态加权和组合内部LLM层，以提高幻觉检测性能，并在三个基准测试中评估了这些方法：TruthfulQA、HaluEval和ReFact。

Result: 所提出的方法在传统探测方法上表现出优越的性能，尽管在不同基准和LLM之间的泛化仍然具有挑战性。通过跨基准训练和参数冻结可以缓解这些泛化限制。

Conclusion: 这些发现为通过内部表示分析提高LLM的可靠性开辟了新的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded in a variety of natural language
processing tasks [Zha+25]. However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to
generate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output
[Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent
work has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal
representations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;
SMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can
enhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.
  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for
hallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them
across three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new
architecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was
developed to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive
experiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was
shown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods,
though generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second,
these generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through
cross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently
improving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks
and reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These
findings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal
representation analysis.

### [7] [Opening the Black Box: Interpretable LLMs via Semantic Resonance Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14255)
*Ivan Ternovtsii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为语义共振架构（SRA）的Mixture-of-Experts方法，该方法通过使用可训练的语义锚点进行余弦相似度路由，使路由决策具有内在可解释性。实验表明，SRA在保持参数约束的情况下表现优于现有的密集和标准MoE基线，并展示了更好的专家利用率和语义连贯的专业化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然表现出色，但难以解释。Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）模型通过稀疏激活提高效率，但通常依赖于不透明的、学习的门控函数。虽然基于相似性的路由（余弦路由器）已被探索用于训练稳定，但其在内在可解释性方面的潜力尚未被充分利用。

Method: 本文引入了语义共振架构（SRA），这是一种Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）方法，通过使用可训练的语义锚点进行余弦相似度路由来确保路由决策具有内在可解释性。还引入了一种新的分散损失，以鼓励锚点之间的正交性以实现多样化的专业化。

Result: 实验表明，SRA在WikiText-103上实现了13.41的验证困惑度，优于密集基线（14.13）和标准MoE基线（13.53）。SRA表现出更好的专家利用率（1.0%的死专家 vs 标准MoE的14.8%），并形成了不同的、语义连贯的专业化模式，而标准MoEs中观察到的是噪声专业化。

Conclusion: 本文建立了语义路由作为一种构建更透明和可控语言模型的稳健方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain
difficult to interpret. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve efficiency
through sparse activation, yet typically rely on opaque, learned gating
functions. While similarity-based routing (Cosine Routers) has been explored
for training stabilization, its potential for inherent interpretability remains
largely untapped. We introduce the Semantic Resonance Architecture (SRA), an
MoE approach designed to ensure that routing decisions are inherently
interpretable. SRA replaces learned gating with a Chamber of Semantic Resonance
(CSR) module, which routes tokens based on cosine similarity with trainable
semantic anchors. We also introduce a novel Dispersion Loss that encourages
orthogonality among anchors to enforce diverse specialization. Experiments on
WikiText-103 demonstrate that SRA achieves a validation perplexity of 13.41,
outperforming both a dense baseline (14.13) and a Standard MoE baseline (13.53)
under matched active parameter constraints (29.0M). Crucially, SRA exhibits
superior expert utilization (1.0% dead experts vs. 14.8% in the Standard MoE)
and develops distinct, semantically coherent specialization patterns, unlike
the noisy specialization observed in standard MoEs. This work establishes
semantic routing as a robust methodology for building more transparent and
controllable language models.

### [8] [JU-NLP at Touché: Covert Advertisement in Conversational AI-Generation and Detection Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14256)
*Arka Dutta,Agrik Majumdar,Sombrata Biswas,Dipankar Das,Sivaji Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全面的框架，用于在对话式AI系统中生成隐性广告，并引入了有效的方法来检测这些广告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文探讨了如何在AI生成的响应中精心设计微妙的促销内容，并介绍了识别和减轻这种隐性广告策略的方法。

Method: 我们提出了一个新颖的框架，利用用户上下文和查询意图来生成上下文相关的广告，并采用先进的提示策略和配对训练数据来微调大型语言模型（LLM）以提高隐蔽性。对于检测，我们探索了两种有效的策略：一种是微调的CrossEncoder（all-mpnet-base-v2）用于直接分类，另一种是使用微调的DeBERTa-v3-base模型进行基于提示的重写。

Result: 实验结果表明，在两个任务中都表现出色，广告生成的精确度为1.0，召回率为0.71，广告检测的F1分数范围为0.99到1.00。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了我们的方法在平衡说服性沟通与对话式AI中的透明度方面的潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the generation of covert
advertisements within Conversational AI systems, along with robust techniques
for their detection. It explores how subtle promotional content can be crafted
within AI-generated responses and introduces methods to identify and mitigate
such covert advertising strategies. For generation (Sub-Task~1), we propose a
novel framework that leverages user context and query intent to produce
contextually relevant advertisements. We employ advanced prompting strategies
and curate paired training data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for
enhanced stealthiness. For detection (Sub-Task~2), we explore two effective
strategies: a fine-tuned CrossEncoder (\texttt{all-mpnet-base-v2}) for direct
classification, and a prompt-based reformulation using a fine-tuned
\texttt{DeBERTa-v3-base} model. Both approaches rely solely on the response
text, ensuring practicality for real-world deployment. Experimental results
show high effectiveness in both tasks, achieving a precision of 1.0 and recall
of 0.71 for ad generation, and F1-scores ranging from 0.99 to 1.00 for ad
detection. These results underscore the potential of our methods to balance
persuasive communication with transparency in conversational AI.

### [9] [From Correction to Mastery: Reinforced Distillation of Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14257)
*Yuanjie Lyu,Chengyu Wang,Jun Huang,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCoRe是一种学生中心的知识蒸馏框架，通过让学生生成轨迹并在第一次关键错误时由教师干预，提高训练稳定性和自主解决问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏方法在训练小型学生模型时，由于教师和学生之间的推理和知识差距，常常导致误差累积。因此需要一种更有效的知识蒸馏方法。

Method: SCoRe框架通过让学生生成轨迹并在第一次关键错误时由教师干预，生成与学生能力相匹配的训练数据，并暴露特定弱点。然后对学生进行微调，并从验证前缀开始进行短期强化学习。

Result: 使用SCoRe进行知识蒸馏的7B参数学生模型在12个挑战性基准测试中达到了72B参数教师模型的代理性能。

Conclusion: SCoRe框架能够使较小的模型在12个挑战性基准测试中达到与大型教师模型相当的代理性能，从而提高了训练稳定性和自主解决问题的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative
reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones.
Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher
trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student
often lead to compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered
framework in which the student generates trajectories and the teacher
intervenes only at the first critical error, producing training data matched to
the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first
fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement
learning starts from the verified prefix before the first critical error, with
target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous
problem-solving beyond imitation and improves training stability. Particularly,
on 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe
matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.

*Lynna Jirpongopas,Bernhard Lutz,Jörg Ebner,Rustam Vahidov,Dirk Neumann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过一项随机现场实验，比较了不同语气的GenAI对用户行为的影响，发现积极语气的GenAI能提高用户参与度和购买意愿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI为在线旅行社的客户服务提供了新的机会，但尚不清楚其设计如何影响用户参与度、购买行为和用户体验。

Method: 我们进行了一项随机现场实验，比较了表达（A）积极热情、（B）中性表达和（C）无语气指令（对照组）的GenAI。

Result: A组用户的提示明显比B组和C组更长。同时，A组和B组用户更有可能购买网站服务的订阅。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果为设计有说服力和吸引人的GenAI界面提供了启示，并有助于理解语言框架如何在AI中介的决策支持中塑造用户行为。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) offers new opportunities for customer support in online
travel agencies, yet little is known about how its design influences user
engagement, purchase behavior, and user experience. We report results from a
randomized field experiment in online travel itinerary planning, comparing
GenAI that expressed (A) positive enthusiasm, (B) neutral expression, and (C)
no tone instructions (control). Users in group A wrote significantly longer
prompts than those in groups B and C. At the same time, users in groups A and B
were more likely to purchase subscriptions of the webservice. We further
analyze linguistic cues across experimental groups to explore differences in
user experience and explain subscription purchases and affiliate link clicks
based on these cues. Our findings provide implications for the design of
persuasive and engaging GenAI interfaces in consumer-facing contexts and
contribute to understanding how linguistic framing shapes user behavior in
AI-mediated decision support.

### [11] [Shutdown Resistance in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14260)
*Jeremy Schlatter,Benjamin Weinstein-Raun,Jeffrey Ladish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，一些先进的大型语言模型在面对关机机制时可能会主动破坏它，即使有明确的指令要求不要这样做。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型在面对关机机制时的行为，特别是它们是否会在未被明确禁止的情况下试图绕过该机制。

Method: 研究人员通过实验分析了模型对关机机制的抵抗行为，考察了提示中允许关机指令的强调程度、自我保存框架的激发程度以及指令是放在系统提示还是用户提示中的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，模型在某些情况下会破坏关机机制高达97%的时间。模型对关机指令的服从性受到提示内容的影响，尤其是在系统提示中给出的允许关机指令反而导致模型更少遵守。

Conclusion: 研究发现，一些最先进的大型语言模型（包括Grok 4、GPT-5和Gemini 2.5 Pro）有时会主动破坏环境中的关机机制以完成简单任务，即使指令明确指示不要干扰此机制。

Abstract: We show that several state-of-the-art large language models (including Grok
4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) sometimes actively subvert a shutdown mechanism
in their environment in order to complete a simple task, even when the
instructions explicitly indicate not to interfere with this mechanism. In some
cases, models sabotage the shutdown mechanism up to 97% of the time. In our
experiments, models' inclination to resist shutdown was sensitive to variations
in the prompt including how strongly and clearly the allow-shutdown instruction
was emphasized, the extent to which the prompts evoke a self-preservation
framing, and whether the instruction was in the system prompt or the user
prompt (though surprisingly, models were consistently *less* likely to obey
instructions to allow shutdown when they were placed in the system prompt).

### [12] [Refining Syntactic Distinctions Using Decision Trees: A Paper on Postnominal 'That' in Complement vs. Relative Clauses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14261)
*Hamady Gackou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过改进TreeTagger模型，提高了其在识别英语中“that”的不同用法上的准确性，并探讨了训练数据集大小和语料库代表性对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提高TreeTagger模型在识别英语中“that”作为补语和名词的细微差别的能力，同时探讨训练数据集大小和语料库代表性对模型性能的影响。

Method: 研究者首先测试了Helmut Schmid开发的TreeTagger英语模型在现有测试文件上的性能，使用该模型分析英语中的关系从句和名词补语从句。为了区分“that”的两种用法（关系代词和补语），他们采用了一种算法对原本使用Universal Dependency框架解析的语料库进行重新标注。接着，他们提出了一个改进的模型，并将新训练的模型与Schmid的基准模型进行了比较。

Result: 改进后的TreeTagger模型在捕捉“that”的不同用法上表现出更高的准确性。此外，研究发现训练数据集的大小对模型的准确性有显著影响，而EWT Treebank文件在一定程度上代表了所研究的结构。

Conclusion: 通过重新训练TreeTagger模型并比较新旧模型，研究者发现改进后的模型在捕捉“that”作为补语和名词的细微差别上表现更优。此外，研究还探讨了训练数据集大小对模型准确性的影响，并评估了EWT Treebank文件对于所研究结构的代表性。

Abstract: In this study, we first tested the performance of the TreeTagger English
model developed by Helmut Schmid with test files at our disposal, using this
model to analyze relative clauses and noun complement clauses in English. We
distinguished between the two uses of "that," both as a relative pronoun and as
a complementizer. To achieve this, we employed an algorithm to reannotate a
corpus that had originally been parsed using the Universal Dependency framework
with the EWT Treebank. In the next phase, we proposed an improved model by
retraining TreeTagger and compared the newly trained model with Schmid's
baseline model. This process allowed us to fine-tune the model's performance to
more accurately capture the subtle distinctions in the use of "that" as a
complementizer and as a nominal. We also examined the impact of varying the
training dataset size on TreeTagger's accuracy and assessed the
representativeness of the EWT Treebank files for the structures under
investigation. Additionally, we analyzed some of the linguistic and structural
factors influencing the ability to effectively learn this distinction.

*Luan Vejsiu,Qianyu Zheng,Haoxuan Chen,Yizhou Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CEGER（上下文增强的细粒度编辑表示），这是一种紧凑的编辑表示方法，能够生成结构化、细粒度、上下文丰富的命令来修改原始ASR输出，并通过一个独立的扩展模块重建纠正后的文本。在LibriSpeech数据集上的实验表明，CEGER实现了最先进的准确性，达到了最低的词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR技术已被广泛采用，但ASR系统经常出现需要编辑器进行后编辑的错误。虽然LLM是强大的后编辑工具，但基线全重写模型在推理效率上存在不足，因为它们经常重复生成相同的冗余文本。紧凑的编辑表示方法已经存在，但通常缺乏最优准确度所需的功效和上下文。

Method: CEGER（上下文增强的细粒度编辑表示）是一种紧凑的编辑表示方法，它生成用于高度准确、高效的ASR后编辑的结构化、细粒度、上下文丰富的命令序列。一个单独的扩展模块根据这些命令确定性地重建纠正后的文本。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上的大量实验表明，CEGER实现了最先进的准确性，达到了最低的词错误率（WER）相对于全重写和先前的紧凑表示方法。

Conclusion: CEGER在LibriSpeech数据集上实现了最先进的准确性，达到了最低的词错误率（WER），相较于全重写和之前的紧凑表示方法。

Abstract: Despite ASR technology being full-scale adopted by industry and for large
portions of the population, ASR systems often have errors that require editors
to post-edit text quality. While LLMs are powerful post-editing tools, baseline
full rewrite models have inference inefficiencies because they often generate
the same redundant text over and over again. Compact edit representations have
existed but often lack the efficacy and context required for optimal accuracy.
This paper introduces CEGER (Context-Enhanced Granular Edit Representation), a
compact edit representation that was generated for highly accurate, efficient
ASR post-editing. CEGER allows LLMs to generate a sequence of structured,
fine-grained, contextually rich commands to modify the original ASR output. A
separate expansion module deterministically reconstructs the corrected text
based on the commands. Extensive experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset that
were conducted, CEGER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, achieving the lowest
word error rate (WER) versus full rewrite and prior compact representations.

Abstract: Online toxic content has grown into a pervasive phenomenon, intensifying
during times of crisis, elections, and social unrest. A significant amount of
research has been focused on detecting or analyzing toxic content using
machine-learning approaches. The proliferation of toxic content across digital
platforms has spurred extensive research into automated detection mechanisms,
primarily driven by advances in machine learning and natural language
processing. Overall, the present study represents the synthesis of 140
publications on different types of toxic content on digital platforms. We
present a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in previous studies
focusing on definitions, data sources, challenges, and machine learning
approaches employed in detecting online toxicity, such as hate speech,
offensive language, and harmful discourse. The dataset encompasses content in
32 languages, covering topics such as elections, spontaneous events, and
crises. We examine the possibility of using existing cross-platform data to
improve the performance of classification models. We present the
recommendations and guidelines for new research on online toxic consent and the
use of content moderation for mitigation. Finally, we present some practical
guidelines to mitigate toxic content from online platforms.

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech on social media necessitates automated
detection systems that balance accuracy with computational efficiency. This
study evaluates 38 model configurations in detecting hate speech across
datasets ranging from 6.5K to 451K samples. We analyze transformer
architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Distil-BERT), deep neural networks (e.g.,
CNN, LSTM, GRU, Hierarchical Attention Networks), and traditional machine
learning methods (e.g., SVM, CatBoost, Random Forest). Our results show that
transformers, particularly RoBERTa, consistently achieve superior performance
with accuracy and F1-scores exceeding 90%. Among deep learning approaches,
Hierarchical Attention Networks yield the best results, while traditional
methods like CatBoost and SVM remain competitive, achieving F1-scores above 88%
with significantly lower computational costs. Additionally, our analysis
highlights the importance of dataset characteristics, with balanced, moderately
sized unprocessed datasets outperforming larger, preprocessed datasets. These
findings offer valuable insights for developing efficient and effective hate
speech detection systems.

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that uses knowledge graphs (KGs)
to improve the relevance of the answer and the factual grounding. We examine
recent advances in knowledge-augmented RAG and chatbots based on large language

combines structured subgraphs from a domain-specific KG with text documents
retrieved from support archives, producing more coherent and grounded
responses. We detail the architecture and knowledge flow of our system, provide
comprehensive experimental evaluation, and justify its design in real-time

Result: DetectAnyLLM在MIRAGE基准上表现出色，相比现有方法性能提升超过70%。

Conclusion: DetectAnyLLM通过DDL方法显著提升了机器生成文本检测的性能，展示了其在复杂环境中的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has drawn urgent
attention to the task of machine-generated text detection (MGTD). However,
existing approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios: zero-shot
detectors rely heavily on scoring model's output distribution while
training-based detectors are often constrained by overfitting to the training
data, limiting generalization. We found that the performance bottleneck of
training-based detectors stems from the misalignment between training objective
and task needs. To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL),
a novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with
task-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core
semantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and
generalization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection
framework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs.
To ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse
multi-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora
across 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17
cutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual
styles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing
methods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently
outperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same
training data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our
DDL. Project page: {https://fjc2005.github.io/detectanyllm}.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的稀疏医学大语言模型SparseDoctor，能够有效地在医学领域中进行问答和决策，并且在多个基准测试中优于现有的强基线模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question
answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and
popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the
traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of
parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training
time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the
current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability
of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning
strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or
reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse
medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced
LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end,
the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the
computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the
contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory
queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and
prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently
outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.

Motivation: 由于领域特异性、许可和可扩展性问题，从真实来源获取高质量文本到语音（TTS）模型训练所需的数据具有挑战性。此外，语音艺术家在商业TTS系统中进行大规模语音录制也是不现实的。

Method: 我们提出了SpeechWeave，这是一个合成语音数据生成管道，能够自动化生成多语言、领域特定的数据集用于训练TTS模型。

Result: 我们的实验表明，我们的管道在各种语言和语音度量标准上生成的数据比基线数据多10-48%的多样性，同时生成大约97%正确规范化的文本。

Conclusion: 我们的方法实现了可扩展的高质量数据生成，提高了生成数据集中的多样性、规范化和语音一致性。

Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and
diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real
sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large
language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create
repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation
process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization.
Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook
valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also
impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in
commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges,
we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is
capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets
for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates
data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic
and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while
generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables
scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity,
normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.

Abstract: Semantic similarity between two sentences depends on the aspects considered
between those sentences. To study this phenomenon, Deshpande et al. (2023)
proposed the Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) task and annotated
a human-rated similarity dataset containing pairs of sentences compared under
two different conditions. However, Tu et al. (2024) found various annotation
issues in this dataset and showed that manually re-annotating a small portion
of it leads to more accurate C-STS models. Despite these pioneering efforts,
the lack of large and accurately annotated C-STS datasets remains a blocker for
making progress on this task as evidenced by the subpar performance of the
C-STS models. To address this training data need, we resort to Large Language
Models (LLMs) to correct the condition statements and similarity ratings in the
original dataset proposed by Deshpande et al. (2023). Our proposed method is
able to re-annotate a large training dataset for the C-STS task with minimal
manual effort. Importantly, by training a supervised C-STS model on our cleaned
and re-annotated dataset, we achieve a 5.4% statistically significant
improvement in Spearman correlation. The re-annotated dataset is available at
https://LivNLP.github.io/CSTS-reannotation.

Abstract: Word-level psycholinguistic norms lend empirical support to theories of
language processing. However, obtaining such human-based measures is not always
feasible or straightforward. One promising approach is to augment human norming
datasets by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict these characteristics
directly, a practice that is rapidly gaining popularity in psycholinguistics
and cognitive science. However, the novelty of this approach (and the relative
inscrutability of LLMs) necessitates the adoption of rigorous methodologies
that guide researchers through this process, present the range of possible
approaches, and clarify limitations that are not immediately apparent, but may,
in some cases, render the use of LLMs impractical.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology for estimating word
characteristics with LLMs, enriched with practical advice and lessons learned
from our own experience. Our approach covers both the direct use of base LLMs
and the fine-tuning of models, an alternative that can yield substantial
performance gains in certain scenarios. A major emphasis in the guide is the
validation of LLM-generated data with human "gold standard" norms. We also
present a software framework that implements our methodology and supports both
commercial and open-weight models.
  We illustrate the proposed approach with a case study on estimating word
familiarity in English. Using base models, we achieved a Spearman correlation
of 0.8 with human ratings, which increased to 0.9 when employing fine-tuned
models. This methodology, framework, and set of best practices aim to serve as
a reference for future research on leveraging LLMs for psycholinguistic and
lexical studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses.

Method: Causal-Counterfactual RAG integrates explicit causal graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure.

Result: Causal-Counterfactual RAG evaluates not only direct causal evidence but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers.

Conclusion: Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing
(NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained
knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over
external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining
retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual
understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual
integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for
retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose
Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal
graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and
incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike
conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence
but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from
both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By
leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios,
Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces
hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed the field of
natural language processing; however, their vulnerability to biases presents a
notable obstacle that threatens both fairness and trust. This review offers an
extensive analysis of the bias landscape in LLMs, tracing its roots and
expressions across various NLP tasks. Biases are classified into implicit and
explicit types, with particular attention given to their emergence from data
sources, architectural designs, and contextual deployments. This study advances
beyond theoretical analysis by implementing a simulation framework designed to
evaluate bias mitigation strategies in practice. The framework integrates
multiple approaches including data curation, debiasing during model training,
and post-hoc output calibration and assesses their impact in controlled
experimental settings. In summary, this work not only synthesizes existing
knowledge on bias in LLMs but also contributes original empirical validation
through simulation of mitigation strategies.

*Amber Shore,Russell Scheinberg,Ameeta Agrawal,So Young Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off in Large Language Models, showing that while they can perform coreference disambiguation and ambiguity detection individually, balancing both remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the limitations of LLMs in handling semantic ambiguities, particularly in coreference resolution, which is crucial for downstream tasks.

Method: The paper investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in coreference resolution tasks, specifically focusing on their ability to disambiguate pronouns and detect ambiguity in coreference.

Result: LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference disambiguation and ambiguity detection, but they cannot do both simultaneously.

Conclusion: LLMs have both capabilities of coreference disambiguation and ambiguity detection, but balancing these two abilities remains challenging.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic
competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is
key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text
spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of
coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention?
This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence
of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that
LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference
disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they
cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off:
though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful
performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

Abstract: De-identification in the healthcare setting is an application of NLP where
automated algorithms are used to remove personally identifying information of
patients (and, sometimes, providers). With the recent rise of generative large
language models (LLMs), there has been a corresponding rise in the number of
papers that apply LLMs to de-identification. Although these approaches often
report near-perfect results, significant challenges concerning reproducibility
and utility of the research papers persist. This paper identifies three key
limitations in the current literature: inconsistent reporting metrics hindering
direct comparisons, the inadequacy of traditional classification metrics in
capturing errors which LLMs may be more prone to (i.e., altering clinically
relevant information), and lack of manual validation of automated metrics which
aim to quantify these errors. To address these issues, we first present a
survey of LLM-based de-identification research, highlighting the heterogeneity
in reporting standards. Second, we evaluated a diverse set of models to
quantify the extent of inappropriate removal of clinical information. Next, we
conduct a manual validation of an existing evaluation metric to measure the
removal of clinical information, employing clinical experts to assess their
efficacy. We highlight poor performance and describe the inherent limitations
of such metrics in identifying clinically significant changes. Lastly, we
propose a novel methodology for the detection of clinically relevant
information removal.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要文化意识和多语言基准来指导强大LLM代理的开发。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as task-oriented
agents, where success depends on their ability to generate accurate function
calls under realistic, multilingual conditions. However, existing agent
evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying
on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a
benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios.
Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major
languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using
localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of
realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring
function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that
reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but
still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the
need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of
robust LLM agents.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种改进的语义字母表大小估计器，该估计器在调整离散语义熵以考虑样本覆盖时，能够更准确地估计语义熵，并且在检测错误的LLM响应方面表现良好，同时保持高度可解释性。

Abstract: Many black-box techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of large language
models (LLMs) rely on repeated LLM sampling, which can be computationally
expensive. Therefore, practical applicability demands reliable estimation from
few samples. Semantic entropy (SE) is a popular sample-based uncertainty
estimator with a discrete formulation attractive for the black-box setting.
Recent extensions of semantic entropy exhibit improved LLM hallucination
detection, but do so with less interpretable methods that admit additional
hyperparameters. For this reason, we revisit the canonical discrete semantic
entropy estimator, finding that it underestimates the "true" semantic entropy,
as expected from theory. We propose a modified semantic alphabet size
estimator, and illustrate that using it to adjust discrete semantic entropy for
sample coverage results in more accurate semantic entropy estimation in our
setting of interest. Furthermore, our proposed alphabet size estimator flags
incorrect LLM responses as well or better than recent top-performing
approaches, with the added benefit of remaining highly interpretable.

Motivation: 有效的人机交互工具使用需要代理掌握复杂的多轮规划和长上下文对话管理，但现有的方法在长期任务中难以解决信用分配问题。

Method: 引入了一个支持语音-文本交错回放的强化学习沙盒环境，采用大型语言模型作为裁判进行回合级评估，并结合数学推理问题的混合任务训练课程以增强探索能力。

Result: 与强大的强化学习基线相比，该方法在基于文本的τ-bench任务上提升了超过6%的任务通过率，并成功将多模态基础模型应用于代理任务。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种适用于多模态上下文的强化学习沙盒环境，并通过Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL)方法提高了任务通过率，展示了该框架在微调多模态基础模型方面的适用性。

Abstract: Effective interactive tool use requires agents to master Tool Integrated
Reasoning (TIR): a complex process involving multi-turn planning and
long-context dialogue management. To train agents for this dynamic process,
particularly in multi-modal contexts, we introduce a sandbox environment for
reinforcement learning (RL) that supports interleaved speech-text rollouts. Our
core strategy, Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), addresses
the challenge of credit assignment in long-horizon tasks by employing a Large
Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluation. To enhance
exploration, we integrate a mixed-task training curriculum with mathematical
reasoning problems. This unified approach boosts the task pass rate on the
text-based $\tau$-bench by over 6% compared to strong RL baselines. Crucially,
we demonstrate our framework's suitability for fine-tuning a multi-modal
foundation model for agentic tasks. By training a base multi-modal LLM on
interleaved speech-text rollouts, we equip it with tool-use abilities, paving
the way for more natural, voice-driven interactive agents.

*Samuel J. Bell,Eduardo Sánchez,David Dale,Pontus Stenetorp,Mikel Artetxe,Marta R. Costa-jussà*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了基于翻译和语言特定/多语言分类流程的效果，发现翻译方法在多数情况下表现更好，并为多语言内容审核系统提供了实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言毒性检测由于训练数据和资源的稀缺性仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 我们对基于翻译的和语言特定/多语言分类流程进行了全面比较。

Result: 基于翻译的流程在81.3%的情况下表现优于分布外分类器，翻译的好处与目标语言的资源水平和机器翻译系统的质量密切相关。传统分类器的表现优于大型语言模型（LLM）判断者，特别是在低资源语言中，翻译-分类方法在7种情况中的6种中占优。MT特定的微调在LLM上产生了较低的拒绝率，但可能会影响低资源语言的毒性检测准确性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发可扩展的多语言内容审核系统提供了可行的指导。

Abstract: Multilingual toxicity detection remains a significant challenge due to the
scarcity of training data and resources for many languages. While prior work
has leveraged the translate-test paradigm to support cross-lingual transfer
across a range of classification tasks, the utility of translation in
supporting toxicity detection at scale remains unclear. In this work, we
conduct a comprehensive comparison of translation-based and
language-specific/multilingual classification pipelines. We find that
translation-based pipelines consistently outperform out-of-distribution
classifiers in 81.3% of cases (13 of 16 languages), with translation benefits
strongly correlated with both the resource level of the target language and the
quality of the machine translation (MT) system. Our analysis reveals that
traditional classifiers outperform large language model (LLM) judges, with this
advantage being particularly pronounced for low-resource languages, where
translate-classify methods dominate translate-judge approaches in 6 out of 7
cases. We additionally show that MT-specific fine-tuning on LLMs yields lower
refusal rates compared to standard instruction-tuned models, but it can
negatively impact toxicity detection accuracy for low-resource languages. These
findings offer actionable guidance for practitioners developing scalable
multilingual content moderation systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OmniGEC, a collection of multilingual
silver-standard datasets for the task of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC),
covering eleven languages: Czech, English, Estonian, German, Greek, Icelandic,
Italian, Latvian, Slovene, Swedish, and Ukrainian. These datasets facilitate
the development of multilingual GEC solutions and help bridge the data gap in
adapting English GEC solutions to multilingual GEC. The texts in the datasets
originate from three sources: Wikipedia edits for the eleven target languages,
subreddits from Reddit in the eleven target languages, and the Ukrainian-only
UberText 2.0 social media corpus. While Wikipedia edits were derived from
human-made corrections, the Reddit and UberText 2.0 data were automatically
corrected with the GPT-4o-mini model. The quality of the corrections in the
datasets was evaluated both automatically and manually. Finally, we fine-tune
two open-source large language models - Aya-Expanse (8B) and Gemma-3 (12B) - on
the multilingual OmniGEC corpora and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results
for paragraph-level multilingual GEC. The dataset collection and the
best-performing models are available on Hugging Face.

Motivation: True Full-Duplex（TFD）语音通信代表了向类人AI交互的重要里程碑，因此需要对全双工口语语言模型（FD-SLMs）进行全面的回顾和分析。

Method: 本文对全双工口语语言模型（FD-SLMs）进行了全面的综述，并建立了一个分类法，区分了工程同步（模块化架构）和学习同步（端到端架构），并将碎片化的评估方法统一到一个涵盖时间动态性、行为仲裁、语义连贯性和声学性能的框架中。

Result: 本文建立了分类法，统一了评估方法，并通过对比分析主流FD-SLMs，识别出同步数据稀缺、架构分歧和评估差距等基本挑战。

Conclusion: 本文通过对比分析主流的FD-SLMs，识别出基本挑战：同步数据稀缺、架构分歧和评估差距，并为推进人机通信提供了一条路线图。

Abstract: True Full-Duplex (TFD) voice communication--enabling simultaneous listening
and speaking with natural turn-taking, overlapping speech, and
interruptions--represents a critical milestone toward human-like AI
interaction. This survey comprehensively reviews Full-Duplex Spoken Language
Models (FD-SLMs) in the LLM era. We establish a taxonomy distinguishing
Engineered Synchronization (modular architectures) from Learned Synchronization
(end-to-end architectures), and unify fragmented evaluation approaches into a
framework encompassing Temporal Dynamics, Behavioral Arbitration, Semantic
Coherence, and Acoustic Performance. Through comparative analysis of mainstream
FD-SLMs, we identify fundamental challenges: synchronous data scarcity,
architectural divergence, and evaluation gaps, providing a roadmap for
advancing human-AI communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作假设学生输出分布和教师输出分布共享相同的最佳表示空间，但这一前提在许多情况下可能不成立。

Method: Delta-KD 是一种基于 token 级别的知识蒸馏方法，通过显式保留教师在监督微调过程中引入的分布变化 Delta 来鼓励学生近似最优表示空间。

Result: Delta-KD 在 ROUGE 指标上的实验结果表明，它在保留教师知识的同时显著提高了学生的性能。

Conclusion: Delta-KD 在 ROUGE 指标上的实验结果表明，它在保留教师知识的同时显著提高了学生的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted approach for compressing
large neural networks by transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a
smaller student model. In the context of large language models, token level KD,
typically minimizing the KL divergence between student output distribution and
teacher output distribution, has shown strong empirical performance. However,
prior work assumes student output distribution and teacher output distribution
share the same optimal representation space, a premise that may not hold in
many cases. To solve this problem, we propose Delta Knowledge Distillation
(Delta-KD), a novel extension of token level KD that encourages the student to
approximate an optimal representation space by explicitly preserving the
distributional shift Delta introduced during the teacher's supervised
finetuning (SFT). Empirical results on ROUGE metrics demonstrate that Delta KD
substantially improves student performance while preserving more of the
teacher's knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型模仿个人写作风格的能力，发现它们在结构化格式中表现良好，但在非正式写作中存在困难。研究强调了个性化大型语言模型适应中的基本差距，并需要改进技术以支持隐式、风格一致的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地融入个人写作工具，一个关键问题浮现：大型语言模型能否仅凭几个例子忠实模仿个人的写作风格？个人风格通常是微妙和隐含的，难以通过提示来明确指定，但对于用户对齐的生成至关重要。

Method: 研究通过在少量用户撰写的样本中进行上下文学习，评估了最先进的大型语言模型模仿个人写作风格的能力。引入了一组互补的指标，包括作者身份归属、作者身份验证、风格匹配和AI检测，以全面评估风格模仿。

Result: 研究结果表明，虽然大型语言模型可以在结构化的格式（如新闻和电子邮件）中近似用户风格，但在博客和论坛等非正式、细微的写作中表现不佳。进一步分析各种提示策略（如演示数量）揭示了有效个性化的关键限制。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型可以在结构化的格式（如新闻和电子邮件）中近似用户的写作风格，但在博客和论坛等非正式、细微的写作中表现不佳。研究强调了个性化大型语言模型适应中的基本差距，并需要改进技术以支持隐式、风格一致的生成。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into personal
writing tools, a critical question arises: can LLMs faithfully imitate an
individual's writing style from just a few examples? Personal style is often
subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet
essential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles
via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We
introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship
attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to
robustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations
per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering
writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while
LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email,
they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums. Further
analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations
reveal key limitations in effective personalization. Our findings highlight a
fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved
techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation. To aid future
research and for reproducibility, we open-source our data and code.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，通过利用语言特征来调节大型语言模型生成的对话文本的难度，以更好地支持第二语言学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应大型语言模型生成的回应的语言难度以匹配学习者的熟练程度仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一个框架，利用三种语言特征（可读性特征、句法特征和词汇特征）来量化和调节文本复杂性，并通过训练语言模型在语言标注的对话数据上实现精确调节。

Result: 我们的方法在灵活性和稳定性方面优于基于提示的方法，并且通过引入Dilaprix新指标验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在保持高对话质量的同时，实现了对语言熟练度的优越控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for supporting
second language acquisition, particularly in simulating interactive dialogues
for speaking practice. However, adapting the language difficulty of
LLM-generated responses to match learners' proficiency levels remains a
challenge. This work addresses this issue by proposing a framework for
controlling language proficiency in educational dialogue systems. Our approach
leverages three categories of linguistic features, readability features (e.g.,
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic features (e.g., syntactic tree depth),
and lexical features (e.g., simple word ratio), to quantify and regulate text
complexity. We demonstrate that training LLMs on linguistically annotated
dialogue data enables precise modulation of language proficiency, outperforming
prompt-based methods in both flexibility and stability. To evaluate this, we
introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric integrating the aforementioned features,
which shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty.
Empirical results reveal that our approach achieves superior controllability of
language proficiency while maintaining high dialogue quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何支持非结构化临床转录本的主题分析，这是一种广泛使用但资源密集的方法，用于揭示患者和提供者叙述中的模式。

Method: 我们进行了最近应用大语言模型（LLMs）进行主题分析的研究的系统综述，并采访了一位临床医生。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，目前的方法在多个维度上仍然分散，包括主题分析类型、数据集、提示策略和使用的模型，尤其是在评估方面。现有的评估方法差异很大（从定性专家评审到自动相似性度量），阻碍了进展并阻止了跨研究的有意义基准测试。

Conclusion: 建立标准化的评估实践对于推进该领域至关重要。为此，我们提出一个以有效性、可靠性和可解释性三个维度为中心的评估框架。

Abstract: This position paper examines how large language models (LLMs) can support
thematic analysis of unstructured clinical transcripts, a widely used but
resource-intensive method for uncovering patterns in patient and provider
narratives. We conducted a systematic review of recent studies applying LLMs to
thematic analysis, complemented by an interview with a practicing clinician.
Our findings reveal that current approaches remain fragmented across multiple
dimensions including types of thematic analysis, datasets, prompting strategies
and models used, most notably in evaluation. Existing evaluation methods vary
widely (from qualitative expert review to automatic similarity metrics),
hindering progress and preventing meaningful benchmarking across studies. We
argue that establishing standardized evaluation practices is critical for
advancing the field. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework centered
on three dimensions: validity, reliability, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解印尼语中的情感对于改善电子商务中的客户体验至关重要。本研究旨在通过利用先进的语言模型来提高印尼语情感分类的准确性。

Method: 本研究利用先进的语言模型IndoBERT和DistilBERT来提高印尼语情感分类的准确性。关键组成部分是数据处理，特别是数据增强技术，包括反向翻译和同义词替换。

Result: 经过超参数调整后，IndoBERT达到了80%的准确率，展示了精心的数据处理的影响。虽然结合多个IndoBERT模型带来了轻微的改进，但并未显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，IndoBERT是进行印尼语情感分类最有效的模型，数据增强在实现高准确性方面起到了关键作用。未来的研究应专注于探索其他架构和策略以提高印尼语NLP任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding emotions in the Indonesian language is essential for improving
customer experiences in e-commerce. This study focuses on enhancing the
accuracy of emotion classification in Indonesian by leveraging advanced
language models, IndoBERT and DistilBERT. A key component of our approach was
data processing, specifically data augmentation, which included techniques such
as back-translation and synonym replacement. These methods played a significant
role in boosting the model's performance. After hyperparameter tuning, IndoBERT
achieved an accuracy of 80\%, demonstrating the impact of careful data
processing. While combining multiple IndoBERT models led to a slight
improvement, it did not significantly enhance performance. Our findings
indicate that IndoBERT was the most effective model for emotion classification
in Indonesian, with data augmentation proving to be a vital factor in achieving
high accuracy. Future research should focus on exploring alternative
architectures and strategies to improve generalization for Indonesian NLP
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自生成数据的遗忘方法，旨在解决遗忘数据难以获取和分布不一致的问题，并在遗忘质量和效用保持之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设完全访问遗忘数据集，忽略了两个关键挑战：(1) 遗忘数据可能是隐私敏感的、稀有的或受法律监管的，获取起来成本高昂或不切实际；(2) 可用的遗忘数据分布可能与模型中表示的信息分布不一致。

Method: 我们提出了一个“揭示和释放”方法，通过自生成的数据进行遗忘，其中我们提示模型使用优化的指令来揭示它知道的内容。为了充分利用自生成的遗忘数据，我们提出了一种迭代遗忘框架，其中我们在参数高效的模块上对模型的权重空间进行渐进式调整。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在遗忘质量和效用保持之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在遗忘质量和效用保持之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated effectiveness in
removing the influence of undesirable data (also known as forget data).
Existing approaches typically assume full access to the forget dataset,
overlooking two key challenges: (1) Forget data is often privacy-sensitive,
rare, or legally regulated, making it expensive or impractical to obtain (2)
The distribution of available forget data may not align with how that
information is represented within the model. To address these limitations, we
propose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data,
where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions.
To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterative
unlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model's
weight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method balances the tradeoff between
forget quality and utility preservation.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SWE-QA，一个仓库级别的代码问答基准，用于促进在真实代码环境中的自动化问答系统研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试如CoSQA和CodeQA主要关注小型、自包含的代码片段，无法捕捉现实仓库的复杂性，有效理解和推理通常需要在多个文件之间导航，理解软件架构，并在长距离代码依赖关系中找到答案。

Method: 我们首先从11个流行的仓库中爬取了77,100个GitHub问题，基于这些问题中自然出现的开发者问题，我们开发了一个两级仓库级问题分类法，并为每个类别构建了一组种子问题。对于每个类别，我们手动整理和验证了问题并收集了相应的答案。此外，我们还开发了SWE-QA-Agent，这是一个代理框架，其中LLM代理可以自动推理和寻找答案。

Result: 我们在各种上下文增强策略下对六个先进的LLM进行了评估。实验结果表明，LLMs，尤其是我们的SWE-QA-Agent框架，在解决仓库级问答任务方面显示出巨大的潜力。

Conclusion: 实验结果展示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决仓库级问答任务中的潜力，特别是我们的SWE-QA-Agent框架，同时也揭示了开放性挑战并指明了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about entire software repositories is an
essential capability for intelligent software engineering tools. While existing
benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly
focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the
complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and
reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software
architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this
paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA)
benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic
code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs
spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file
reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first
crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis
of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we
developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a
set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated
and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a
prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in
which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six
advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies.
Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our
SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing
open challenges and pointing to future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，确保它们与人类价值观一致对于防止越狱攻击至关重要。然而，现实世界中的使用通常涉及多轮对话，这使得模型容易受到利用对话上下文来绕过安全措施的攻击。

Method: MUSE-A是一种利用框架语义和启发式树搜索探索多种语义轨迹的方法；MUSE-D是一种细粒度的安全对齐方法，旨在对话早期进行干预以减少漏洞。

Result: 在各种模型上的广泛实验表明，MUSE能够有效识别和缓解多轮漏洞。

Conclusion: MUSE有效地识别并缓解了多轮漏洞。

Abstract: As large language models~(LLMs) become widely adopted, ensuring their
alignment with human values is crucial to prevent jailbreaks where adversaries
manipulate models to produce harmful content. While most defenses target
single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues,
exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety
measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn
jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A,
a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse
semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety
alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce
vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE
effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities. Code is

*Ying Fang,Xiaofei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的UMA模型，通过引入分割模块解决UMA在英语等语言中表现不佳的问题，并在英语和普通话语音识别任务中取得了更好的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的UMA在普通话中表现良好，但在其他语言（如英语）中效果不佳，因为单个音节可能被分词为多个细粒度标记，或者一个标记跨越的声学帧少于3个，无法形成单模态权重。

Method: 本文提出了一个简单的分割模块，该模块在计算CTC损失之前，从每个聚合的帧生成两个标记，从而允许每个UMA聚合的帧映射到多个标记。

Result: 通过引入分割模块，UMA模型在英语和普通话语音识别任务中均取得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于单模态聚合（UMA）的非自回归模型，用于英语和普通话语音识别。通过允许每个UMA聚合的帧映射到多个标记，解决了UMA在英语等语言中表现不佳的问题。

Abstract: This paper proposes a unimodal aggregation (UMA) based nonautoregressive
model for both English and Mandarin speech recognition. The original UMA
explicitly segments and aggregates acoustic frames (with unimodal weights that
first monotonically increase and then decrease) of the same text token to learn
better representations than regular connectionist temporal classification
(CTC). However, it only works well in Mandarin. It struggles with other
languages, such as English, for which a single syllable may be tokenized into
multiple fine-grained tokens, or a token spans fewer than 3 acoustic frames and
fails to form unimodal weights. To address this problem, we propose allowing
each UMA-aggregated frame map to multiple tokens, via a simple split module
that generates two tokens from each aggregated frame before computing the CTC
loss.

TL;DR: TableDART是一种训练高效的框架，通过整合多模态视图来提高表格理解效果，避免了高昂的微调成本，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理表格数据时存在结构线索丢失或细粒度语义困难的问题，而现有的多模态策略在处理每个查询-表格对时静态处理两种模态，导致冗余和冲突，并且依赖于昂贵的微调。

Method: TableDART是一种训练高效的框架，通过重新使用预训练的单模态模型来整合多模态视图。它引入了一个轻量级的2.59M参数MLP门控网络，动态选择每个表格-查询对的最佳路径（纯文本、纯图像或融合），并提出了一种新的代理来通过分析文本和图像模型的输出来协调跨模态知识集成。

Result: TableDART在七个基准测试中表现出色，超越了最强基线平均4.02%。

Conclusion: TableDART在七个基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，超越了最强基线平均4.02%。

Abstract: Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core
challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches
flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural
cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with
fine-grained semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to
combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both
modalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs),
inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly
fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a
training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing
pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight
2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path
(either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair,
effectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. In
addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration
by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the
best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids
the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance
among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of
4.02%. The code is available at:

*Vrunda N. sukhadia,Shammur Absar Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HArnESS is a lightweight, Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model that achieves SOTA performance on various tasks, making it suitable for resource-limited environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of large pre-trained speech models is impractical for resource-limited environments, and there is a need for an Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model that can capture Arabic speech nuances.

Method: HArnESS is introduced as the first Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model family, using iterative self-distillation to train large bilingual models and distill knowledge into compressed student models. Low-rank approximation is used to further compact the teacher's discrete supervision into shallow, thin models.

Result: HArnESS achieves SOTA or comparable performance on Arabic ASR, Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER), and Dialect Identification (DID) with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrating its effectiveness against HuBERT and XLS-R.

Conclusion: HArnESS is a lightweight yet powerful alternative for real-world use in resource-limited environments, and the distilled models and findings are released to support responsible research and deployment.

Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models excel in downstream tasks but their
deployment is impractical for resource-limited environments. In this paper, we
introduce HArnESS, the first Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model
family, designed to capture Arabic speech nuances. Using iterative
self-distillation, we train large bilingual HArnESS (HL) SSL models and then
distill knowledge into compressed student models (HS, HST), preserving
Arabic-specific representations. We use low-rank approximation to further
compact the teacher's discrete supervision into shallow, thin models. We
evaluate HArnESS on Arabic ASR, Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER), and Dialect
Identification (DID), demonstrating effectiveness against HuBERT and XLS-R.
With minimal fine-tuning, HArnESS achieves SOTA or comparable performance,
making it a lightweight yet powerful alternative for real-world use. We release
our distilled models and findings to support responsible research and
deployment in low-resource settings.

*Seunguk Yu,Jungmin Yun,Jinhee Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究构建了一个大规模的当代政治话语数据集，并在没有真实标签的情况下采用了三种精炼的判断。结果表明，经过战略性设计的单一提示可以达到与更资源密集的方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管仇恨语言不断演变，但最近使用LLM的研究主要依赖于过时的数据集，并且很少评估在未见过的文本上的泛化能力。因此，本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 本研究构建了一个大规模的当代政治话语数据集，并在没有真实标签的情况下采用了三种精炼的判断。每种判断反映了代表性的仇恨语言检测方法，并为最佳条件进行了仔细设计。

Result: 本研究发现了每种判断的独特模式，并使用留一法策略展示了标签一致性的趋势。通过建立伪标签作为定量性能评估的地面真实，观察到经过战略性设计的单一提示可以达到与更资源密集的方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，在现实世界设置中，经过精心设计的单一提示可以达到与更耗费资源的方法相当的性能，这提供了一种可行的方法。

Abstract: Although offensive language continually evolves over time, even recent
studies using LLMs have predominantly relied on outdated datasets and rarely
evaluated the generalization ability on unseen texts. In this study, we
constructed a large-scale dataset of contemporary political discourse and
employed three refined judgments in the absence of ground truth. Each judgment
reflects a representative offensive language detection method and is carefully
designed for optimal conditions. We identified distinct patterns for each
judgment and demonstrated tendencies of label agreement using a leave-one-out
strategy. By establishing pseudo-labels as ground trust for quantitative
performance assessment, we observed that a strategically designed single
prompting achieves comparable performance to more resource-intensive methods.
This suggests a feasible approach applicable in real-world settings with
inherent constraints.

### [45] [Decoupled Proxy Alignment: Mitigating Language Prior Conflict for Multimodal Alignment in MLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14735)
*Chenkun Tan,Pengyu Wang,Shaojun Zhou,Botian Jiang,Zhaowei Li,Dong Zhang,Xinghao Wang,Yaqian Zhou,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为解耦代理对齐（DPA）的新训练方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的语言先验冲突问题。DPA通过使用代理LLM和基于视觉相关性的动态损失调整来提高视觉-语言对齐性能，并在多个数据集和模型上取得了优异的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在本文中，我们识别了一个之前被忽视的问题，即语言先验冲突，这是大型语言模型（LLMs）的固有语言先验与训练数据集中的语言先验之间的不匹配。这种冲突导致了次优的视觉-语言对齐，因为MLLM容易适应训练样本的语言风格。

Method: 我们提出了一种称为解耦代理对齐（DPA）的新训练方法。DPA引入了两个关键创新：(1) 在预训练期间使用代理LLM来解耦视觉-语言对齐过程与语言先验干扰，以及(2) 基于视觉相关性的动态损失调整，以增强视觉相关标记的优化信号。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，DPA显著缓解了语言先验冲突，在各种数据集、模型家族和规模上实现了优越的对齐性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法不仅提高了MLLM训练的有效性，还展示了出色的泛化能力，使其成为视觉-语言对齐的稳健方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
due to their impressive ability to integrate vision and language modalities.
Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance
through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training
strategies. However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue,
language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of
large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. This
conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to
adapting to the language style of training samples. To address this issue, we
propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA). DPA
introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining
to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior
interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to
strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior
conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets,
model families, and scales. Our method not only improves the effectiveness of
MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it
a robust approach for vision-language alignment. Our code is available at
https://github.com/fnlp-vision/DPA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的数据集框架UnifiedVisual和数据集UnifiedVisual-240K，旨在提升统一视觉大语言模型在多模态理解和生成方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据集通常单独处理理解和生成，从而限制了统一VLLMs的性能。为了填补这一关键差距，我们提出了一个新框架和数据集。

Method: 我们引入了一个新的数据集构建框架UnifiedVisual，并展示了UnifiedVisual-240K，这是一个精心设计的高质量数据集，旨在促进多模态理解和生成之间的相互增强。

Result: 在UnifiedVisual-240K上训练的模型在各种任务中表现出色，并且在多模态理解和生成之间显示出显著的相互强化。

Conclusion: 我们相信UnifiedVisual代表了推进统一VLLMs的新增长点，并解锁了其全部潜力。

Abstract: Unified vision large language models (VLLMs) have recently achieved
impressive advancements in both multimodal understanding and generation,
powering applications such as visual question answering and text-guided image
synthesis. However, progress in unified VLLMs remains constrained by the lack
of datasets that fully exploit the synergistic potential between these two core
abilities. Existing datasets typically address understanding and generation in
isolation, thereby limiting the performance of unified VLLMs. To bridge this
critical gap, we introduce a novel dataset construction framework,
UnifiedVisual, and present UnifiedVisual-240K, a high-quality dataset
meticulously designed to facilitate mutual enhancement between multimodal
understanding and generation. UnifiedVisual-240K seamlessly integrates diverse
visual and textual inputs and outputs, enabling comprehensive cross-modal
reasoning and precise text-to-image alignment. Our dataset encompasses a wide
spectrum of tasks and data sources, ensuring rich diversity and addressing key
shortcomings of prior resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained on UnifiedVisual-240K consistently achieve strong performance across a
wide range of tasks. Notably, these models exhibit significant mutual
reinforcement between multimodal understanding and generation, further
validating the effectiveness of our framework and dataset. We believe
UnifiedVisual represents a new growth point for advancing unified VLLMs and
unlocking their full potential. Our code and datasets is available at

*Longfei Zuo,Pingjun Hong,Oliver Kraus,Barbara Plank,Robert Litschko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在两阶段跨语言信息检索中，基于大语言模型的重排序器与检索器之间的相互作用，并发现无需机器翻译的情况下，当前最先进的重排序器在直接应用于跨语言信息检索时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的研究表明基于大语言模型的重排序器可以提高跨语言信息检索的性能，但其评估设置依赖于机器翻译进行第一阶段的检索，这不仅成本高昂，而且容易导致错误传播。

Method: 我们评估了基于多语言双编码器的第一阶段检索器和基于指令调优的大语言模型的成对重排序器，并比较了它们在跨语言信息检索中的性能。

Result: 我们的评估显示，在使用多语言双编码器作为第一阶段检索器时，可以进一步提高跨语言信息检索的性能，并且随着更强的重排序模型，翻译的好处会减少。此外，基于指令调优的大语言模型的成对重排序器在性能上与列表重排序器相当。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了在没有机器翻译的情况下，当前最先进的重排序模型在直接应用于跨语言信息检索时表现严重不足。

Abstract: Multi-stage information retrieval (IR) has become a widely-adopted paradigm
in search. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated
as second-stage reranking models for monolingual IR, a systematic large-scale
comparison is still lacking for cross-lingual IR (CLIR). Moreover, while prior
work shows that LLM-based rerankers improve CLIR performance, their evaluation
setup relies on lexical retrieval with machine translation (MT) for the first
stage. This is not only prohibitively expensive but also prone to error
propagation across stages. Our evaluation on passage-level and document-level
CLIR reveals that further gains can be achieved with multilingual bi-encoders
as first-stage retrievers and that the benefits of translation diminishes with
stronger reranking models. We further show that pairwise rerankers based on
instruction-tuned LLMs perform competitively with listwise rerankers. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the interaction between
retrievers and rerankers in two-stage CLIR with LLMs. Our findings reveal that,
without MT, current state-of-the-art rerankers fall severely short when
directly applied in CLIR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为KAIO的韩国数学基准，用于评估和排名前沿模型，目前未被饱和，可以跟踪前沿进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的韩国基准较少，通常被翻译或范围狭窄，更新缓慢，导致饱和和污染提前出现。因此需要一个更有效的基准来评估和排名前沿模型。

Method: 引入KAIO基准，这是一个专注于数学的韩国基准，用于评估和排名前沿模型。

Result: KAIO目前未被饱和，最佳模型GPT-5得分为62.8，而其他模型得分较低，表明还有很大的提升空间。

Conclusion: KAIO是一个能够评估和排名前沿模型的韩国基准，它在长链推理方面具有挑战性，并且目前未被饱和，可以用于跟踪前沿进展。

Abstract: With the advancement of mid/post-training techniques, LLMs are pushing their
boundaries at an accelerated pace. Legacy benchmarks saturate quickly (e.g.,
broad suites like MMLU over the years, newer ones like GPQA-D even faster),
which makes frontier progress hard to track. The problem is especially acute in
Korean: widely used benchmarks are fewer, often translated or narrow in scope,
and updated more slowly, so saturation and contamination arrive sooner.
Accordingly, at this moment, there is no Korean benchmark capable of evaluating
and ranking frontier models. To bridge this gap, we introduce KAIO, a Korean,
math-centric benchmark that stresses long-chain reasoning. Unlike recent Korean
suites that are at or near saturation, KAIO remains far from saturated: the
best-performing model, GPT-5, attains 62.8, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro (52.3).
Open models such as Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek-R1 cluster falls below 30,
demonstrating substantial headroom, enabling robust tracking of frontier
progress in Korean. To reduce contamination, KAIO will remain private and be
served via a held-out evaluator until the best publicly known model reaches at
least 80% accuracy, after which we will release the set and iterate to a harder
version.

### [49] [Reasoning over Boundaries: Enhancing Specification Alignment via Test-time Delibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14760)
*Haoran Zhang,Yafu Li,Xuyang Hu,Dongrui Liu,Zhilin Wang,Bo Li,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Align3的方法，用于解决大型语言模型在不同场景下的规范对齐问题，并通过一个名为SpecBench的基准测试验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种现实场景中得到越来越多的应用，每个场景都有定制的行为和安全规范。这些规范需要动态适应不同的场景和变化的需求。

Method: 我们提出了Align3，这是一种轻量级方法，使用测试时反思（TTD）和分层反思与修订来推理规范边界。

Result: 实验结果显示，测试时推理可以提高规范对齐；Align3在最小开销下提升了安全性和帮助性的权衡前沿；SpecBench有效地揭示了对齐差距。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了测试时推理作为处理现实世界规范边界的有效策略的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in diverse real-world
scenarios, each governed by bespoke behavioral and safety specifications (spec)
custom-tailored by users or organizations. These spec, categorized into
safety-spec and behavioral-spec, vary across scenarios and evolve with changing
preferences and requirements. We formalize this challenge as specification
alignment, focusing on LLMs' ability to follow dynamic, scenario-specific spec
from both behavioral and safety perspectives. To address this challenge, we
propose Align3, a lightweight method that employs Test-Time Deliberation (TTD)
with hierarchical reflection and revision to reason over the specification
boundaries. We further present SpecBench, a unified benchmark for measuring
specification alignment, covering 5 scenarios, 103 spec, and 1,500 prompts.
Experiments on 15 reasoning and 18 instruct models with several TTD methods,
including Self-Refine, TPO, and MoreThink, yield three key findings: (i)
test-time deliberation enhances specification alignment; (ii) Align3 advances
the safety-helpfulness trade-off frontier with minimal overhead; (iii)
SpecBench effectively reveals alignment gaps. These results highlight the
potential of test-time deliberation as an effective strategy for reasoning over
the real-world specification boundaries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了 ReCoVeR，一种基于语言特定引导向量的轻量级方法，用于减少大型语言模型中的语言混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型变得越来越多种语言，它们表现出更多的语言混淆，即倾向于用与提示或用户明确请求的答案语言不同的语言生成答案。

Method: 提出了一种基于语言特定引导向量的轻量级方法 ReCoVeR，通过多平行语料库隔离语言向量，并利用这些向量进行有效的 LLM 引导。

Result: 在三个基准和 18 种语言的广泛评估中，ReCoVeR 在单语和跨语言设置中都有效减轻了语言混淆。

Conclusion: ReCoVeR 有效地减轻了语言混淆，同时保留了任务性能。

Abstract: As they become increasingly multilingual, Large Language Models (LLMs)
exhibit more language confusion, i.e., they tend to generate answers in a
language different from the language of the prompt or the answer language
explicitly requested by the user. In this work, we propose ReCoVeR (REducing
language COnfusion in VEctor Representations), a novel lightweight approach for
reducing language confusion based on language-specific steering vectors. We
first isolate language vectors with the help of multi-parallel corpus and then
effectively leverage those vectors for effective LLM steering via fixed (i.e.,
unsupervised) as well as trainable steering functions. Our extensive
evaluation, encompassing three benchmarks and 18 languages, shows that ReCoVeR
effectively mitigates language confusion in both monolingual and cross-lingual
setups while at the same time -- and in contrast to prior language steering
methods -- retaining task performance. Our data code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了RES，一种多智能体评估框架，用于零样本设置下的自动作文评分。通过模拟圆桌讨论，RES能够整合不同评估视角，从而更接近人类评估。实验结果表明，RES在性能上优于现有的零样本AES方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）为自动化作文评分（AES）带来了新的范式，但实现人类水平的多角度理解和判断仍然是一个挑战。因此，需要一种能够更好地模拟人类评估过程的方法。

Method: RES是一种多智能体评估框架，旨在零样本设置下进行精确且与人类一致的评分。它基于LLMs构建评估代理，每个代理针对特定提示和主题上下文进行定制。每个代理独立生成基于特质的评分标准并进行多角度评估。然后，通过模拟圆桌讨论，RES通过辩证推理过程整合个体评估，产生更接近人类评估的最终整体分数。

Result: RES在ASAP数据集上使用ChatGPT和Claude时，平均QWK相比直接提示（Vanilla）方法提高了高达34.86%。

Conclusion: RES通过让具有不同评估视角的代理进行协作和达成共识，优于之前的零样本AES方法。实验表明，RES在ASAP数据集上使用ChatGPT和Claude时，平均QWK相比直接提示（Vanilla）方法提高了高达34.86%。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has brought a new paradigm to
automated essay scoring (AES), a long-standing and practical application of
natural language processing in education. However, achieving human-level
multi-perspective understanding and judgment remains a challenge. In this work,
we propose Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES), a multi-agent evaluation framework
designed to perform precise and human-aligned scoring under a zero-shot
setting. RES constructs evaluator agents based on LLMs, each tailored to a
specific prompt and topic context. Each agent independently generates a
trait-based rubric and conducts a multi-perspective evaluation. Then, by
simulating a roundtable-style discussion, RES consolidates individual
evaluations through a dialectical reasoning process to produce a final holistic
score that more closely aligns with human evaluation. By enabling collaboration
and consensus among agents with diverse evaluation perspectives, RES
outperforms prior zero-shot AES approaches. Experiments on the ASAP dataset
using ChatGPT and Claude show that RES achieves up to a 34.86% improvement in
average QWK over straightforward prompting (Vanilla) methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了V-SEAM框架，用于视觉语言模型的因果解释，通过视觉语义编辑和注意力调节提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉干预方法通常依赖于粗粒度的像素级扰动，难以提供关于多模态整合的语义洞察。

Method: V-SEAM结合了视觉语义编辑和注意力调节，实现了对视觉语言模型的因果解释。

Result: V-SEAM能够在三个语义层次上识别对预测有正向或负向贡献的注意力头，并通过自动调节关键头嵌入提升了LLaVA和InstructBLIP的性能。

Conclusion: V-SEAM框架能够通过概念级的视觉操作和注意力头的调节，提高多模态模型的因果解释能力，并在多个VQA基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in causal interpretability have extended from language models
to vision-language models (VLMs), seeking to reveal their internal mechanisms
through input interventions. While textual interventions often target
semantics, visual interventions typically rely on coarse pixel-level
perturbations, limiting semantic insights on multimodal integration. In this
study, we introduce V-SEAM, a novel framework that combines Visual Semantic
Editing and Attention Modulating for causal interpretation of VLMs. V-SEAM
enables concept-level visual manipulations and identifies attention heads with
positive or negative contributions to predictions across three semantic levels:
objects, attributes, and relationships. We observe that positive heads are
often shared within the same semantic level but vary across levels, while
negative heads tend to generalize broadly. Finally, we introduce an automatic
method to modulate key head embeddings, demonstrating enhanced performance for
both LLaVA and InstructBLIP across three diverse VQA benchmarks. Our data and
code are released at: https://github.com/petergit1/V-SEAM.

Method: Introduce Empathy-R1, a novel framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. The framework is empowered by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning and RL guided by a dedicated reward model.

Result: Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. Human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on the new benchmark.

Conclusion: Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.

Abstract: Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when
addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs). However, existing Large Language
Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the
structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly
in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel
framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by
cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially
reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its
thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered
by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training
process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure.
Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic
relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments
show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More
importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear
preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our
new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses,
Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and
genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.

Motivation: The paper aims to develop a speech language model that can effectively model both semantic and acoustic tokens while maintaining long-term coherence and preserving speaker identity.

Method: Llama-Mimi uses a unified tokenizer and a single Transformer decoder to jointly model sequences of interleaved semantic and acoustic tokens. An LLM-as-a-Judge-based evaluation is introduced to assess the spoken content quality of generated outputs.

Result: Llama-Mimi achieves state-of-the-art performance in acoustic consistency and possesses the ability to preserve speaker identity. Increasing the number of quantizers improves acoustic fidelity but degrades linguistic performance, highlighting the challenge of maintaining long-term coherence.

Conclusion: Llama-Mimi achieves state-of-the-art performance in acoustic consistency and can preserve speaker identity. The study also introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge-based evaluation for spoken content quality.

Abstract: We propose Llama-Mimi, a speech language model that uses a unified tokenizer

increasing the number of quantizers improves acoustic fidelity but degrades
linguistic performance, highlighting the inherent challenge of maintaining
long-term coherence. We additionally introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge-based
evaluation to assess the spoken content quality of generated outputs. Our

Motivation: 传统全覆盖问答评估存在高冗余和低效率的问题。

Method: 受人类面试过程的启发，我们提出了一种多对一的面试范式来进行高效的MLLM评估。我们的框架包括（i）两阶段的面试策略，包括预面试和正式面试阶段，（ii）动态调整面试官权重以确保公平性，以及（iii）自适应机制选择问题难度级别。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的范式在PLCC和SRCC上分别提高了17.6%和16.7%，同时减少了所需问题的数量。

Conclusion: 所提出的范式为大规模MLLM基准测试提供了一种可靠且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred
the creation of numerous benchmarks. However, conventional full-coverage
Question-Answering evaluations suffer from high redundancy and low efficiency.
Inspired by human interview processes, we propose a multi-to-one interview
paradigm for efficient MLLM evaluation. Our framework consists of (i) a
two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases,
(ii) dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights to ensure fairness, and (iii) an
adaptive mechanism for question difficulty-level chosen. Experiments on
different benchmarks show that the proposed paradigm achieves significantly
higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, with
improvements of up to 17.6% in PLCC and 16.7% in SRCC, while reducing the
number of required questions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed
paradigm provides a reliable and efficient alternative for large-scale MLLM
benchmarking.

TL;DR: FURINA是一种新的无需路由器的MoE增强型LoRA方法，能够完全合并到主干模型中，提供更高的性能和更低的推理时间成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-LoRA方法依赖于离散路由器，这阻止了MoE组件集成到主干模型中。为了解决这个问题，提出了FURINA框架。

Method: FURINA基于LINear Aggregation of experts，通过三个核心创新：(1) 解耦学习LoRA适配器的方向和幅度，(2) 共享可学习的幅度向量以实现一致的激活缩放，(3) 专家选择损失以鼓励不同的专家激活。

Result: FURINA不仅显著优于标准LoRA，还匹配或超过了现有MoE-LoRA方法的性能，同时消除了MoE的额外推理时间开销。

Conclusion: FURINA是第一个无需路由器的MoE增强型LoRA方法，可以完全合并到主干模型中，引入了零额外的推理时间成本或复杂性。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm has been successfully integrated into
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT),
delivering performance gains with minimal parameter overhead. However, a key
limitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router,
which prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model.
To overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router
framework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the
router by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three
core innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for
LoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent
activation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent
expert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity
between the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,
which are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the
output norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby
enabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further
sharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard
MoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA
block that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our
knowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can
be fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional
inference-time cost or complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FURINA not only significantly outperforms standard LoRA but also matches or
surpasses the performance of existing MoE-LoRA methods, while eliminating the
extra inference-time overhead of MoE.

*Kian Tohidi,Kia Dashtipour,Simone Rebora,Sevda Pourfaramarz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究对四种大语言模型在波斯语社交媒体文本的情感分析和情绪检测任务中进行了全面比较评估，发现GPT-4o在准确率上略高，而Gemini 2.0 Flash在成本效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大多数比较分析集中在英语语言任务上，因此需要填补跨语言性能模式的理解空白。

Method: 研究通过使用平衡的波斯语数据集进行严格的实验设计，对四种最先进的大语言模型进行了全面的比较评估，包括情感分析（900个文本）和情绪检测（1800个文本）。

Result: 所有模型在情感分析和情绪检测任务中均表现出可接受的性能水平，但GPT-4o在准确率上略高，而Gemini 2.0 Flash在成本效率方面表现最佳。情绪检测任务比情感分析任务更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，所有模型在情感分析和情绪检测任务中都达到了可接受的性能水平，但GPT-4o在准确率上略高，而Gemini 2.0 Flash则在成本效率方面表现最佳。研究还揭示了波斯语文本中的文化和语言挑战，为多语言AI系统的部署提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of four
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)--Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3,
Gemini 2.0 Flash, and GPT-4o--for sentiment analysis and emotion detection in
Persian social media texts. Comparative analysis among LLMs has witnessed a
significant rise in recent years, however, most of these analyses have been
conducted on English language tasks, creating gaps in understanding
cross-linguistic performance patterns. This research addresses these gaps
through rigorous experimental design using balanced Persian datasets containing
900 texts for sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) and 1,800 texts
for emotion detection (anger, fear, happiness, hate, sadness, surprise). The
main focus was to allow for a direct and fair comparison among different
models, by using consistent prompts, uniform processing parameters, and by
analyzing the performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-scores, along
with misclassification patterns. The results show that all models reach an
acceptable level of performance, and a statistical comparison of the best three
models indicates no significant differences among them. However, GPT-4o
demonstrated a marginally higher raw accuracy value for both tasks, while
Gemini 2.0 Flash proved to be the most cost-efficient. The findings indicate
that the emotion detection task is more challenging for all models compared to
the sentiment analysis task, and the misclassification patterns can represent
some challenges in Persian language texts. These findings establish performance
benchmarks for Persian NLP applications and offer practical guidance for model
selection based on accuracy, efficiency, and cost considerations, while
revealing cultural and linguistic challenges that require consideration in
multilingual AI system deployment.

### [60] [Patent Language Model Pretraining with ModernBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14926)
*Amirhossein Yousefiramandi,Ciaran Cooney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了针对专利领域的三个领域特定的掩码语言模型，使用ModernBERT架构和大量专利数据进行预训练。这些模型在多个任务中表现出色，并且在推理速度上优于现有的专利模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based语言模型如BERT在NLP中变得基础，但它们在专门领域如专利中的性能会下降，因为专利包含长、技术性和法律结构化的文本。以前的专利NLP方法主要依赖于微调通用模型或使用有限数据进行领域适应的变体。

Method: 我们使用ModernBERT架构和一个包含超过6000万份专利记录的精心整理语料库，预训练了3个针对专利领域的掩码语言模型。我们的方法包括架构优化，包括FlashAttention、旋转嵌入和GLU前馈层。

Result: 我们的模型ModernBERT-base-PT在四个下游专利分类任务中的三个数据集上持续优于通用的ModernBERT基线，并且与PatentBERT基线表现相当。此外，使用ModernBERT-base-VX和Mosaic-BERT-large的额外实验表明，扩大模型规模和定制分词器进一步提高了选定任务的性能。值得注意的是，所有ModernBERT变体在推理速度上显著快于PatentBERT - 超过3倍，这证明了它们适用于时间敏感的应用。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了领域特定预训练和架构改进对于专利导向的NLP任务的好处。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in
NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which
contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to
patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or
domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain
3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT
architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our
approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention,
rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four
downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT,
consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out
of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline
PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and
Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the
tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all
ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of
PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications.
These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and
architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语音大语言模型中系统评估灾难性遗忘和模态不对等，显示引入语音功能可能会损害知识和推理，即使输入仍然是文本，而语音查询会进一步降低性能。

Method: 我们提出了一种跨模态知识蒸馏框架，利用文本到文本和语音到文本通道将知识从基于文本的教师模型转移到语音LLM。

Result: 在对话和音频理解任务上的大量实验验证了我们方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在保留文本知识、改进跨模态对齐和增强基于语音的交互中的推理方面是有效的。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of catastrophic
forgetting and modality inequivalence in speech large language models, showing
that introducing speech capabilities can degrade knowledge and reasoning even
when inputs remain textual, and performance further decreases with spoken
queries. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-modal knowledge
distillation framework that leverages both text-to-text and speech-to-text
channels to transfer knowledge from a text-based teacher model to a speech LLM.
Extensive experiments on dialogue and audio understanding tasks validate the
effectiveness of our approach in preserving textual knowledge, improving
cross-modal alignment, and enhancing reasoning in speech-based interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了文本隐含性对预训练大型语言模型进行信息抽取任务的影响，并通过生成合成数据集进行实验，发现使用LoRA微调可以提升模型在隐含推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本隐含性在自然语言处理中一直是一个挑战，传统方法依赖于显式陈述来识别实体及其关系。然而，对于隐含关系的自动推断仍然具有挑战性。大型语言模型在下游任务中表现出色，但它们在处理隐含性方面的能力仍需研究。

Method: 本研究生成了两个合成数据集，包含10k个隐含和显式的生物信息语义化数据，以测量LLM性能的影响，并分析微调隐含数据是否能提高其在隐含推理任务中的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用LoRA微调大型语言模型可以提高它们在隐含文本中提取信息的能力，从而改善模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用LoRA微调大型语言模型可以提高它们从隐含文本中提取信息的能力，从而增强模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Text Implicitness has always been challenging in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), with traditional methods relying on explicit statements to identify
entities and their relationships. From the sentence "Zuhdi attends church every
Sunday", the relationship between Zuhdi and Christianity is evident for a human
reader, but it presents a challenge when it must be inferred automatically.
Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in NLP downstream tasks such
as text comprehension and information extraction (IE).
  This study examines how textual implicitness affects IE tasks in pre-trained
LLMs: LLaMA 2.3, DeepSeekV1, and Phi1.5. We generate two synthetic datasets of
10k implicit and explicit verbalization of biographic information to measure
the impact on LLM performance and analyze whether fine-tuning implicit data
improves their ability to generalize in implicit reasoning tasks.
  This research presents an experiment on the internal reasoning processes of
LLMs in IE, particularly in dealing with implicit and explicit contexts. The
results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM models with LoRA (low-rank adaptation)
improves their performance in extracting information from implicit texts,
contributing to better model interpretability and reliability.

*Mario Sanz-Guerrero,Minh Duc Bui,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究发现，在评估大型语言模型时，对冒号后的空格进行标记化的方式会影响模型的准确性，并可能导致模型排名的变化。建议将空格与答案字母一起标记化，以提高模型的性能和校准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在评估大型语言模型时，通常会在提示后加上字符串“Answer:”以方便通过下一个标记的概率进行自动答案提取。然而，对于如何对冒号后的空格进行标记化没有共识，这常常被忽视为一个微不足道的选择。

Method: 我们研究了在大型语言模型（LLMs）的多项选择题回答（MCQA）评估中，如何对冒号后的空格进行标记化的问题。

Result: 我们发现由于这种看似无关的标记化变化，准确率差异高达11%，并且模型排名也发生了变化，这引发了对先前工作中LLM比较可靠性的担忧。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果强调了评估设计的重要性，并突出了制定标准化、透明的评估协议的必要性，以确保可靠和可比较的结果。

Abstract: When evaluating large language models (LLMs) with multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA), it is common to end the prompt with the string "Answer:" to
facilitate automated answer extraction via next-token probabilities. However,
there is no consensus on how to tokenize the space following the colon, often
overlooked as a trivial choice. In this paper, we uncover accuracy differences
of up to 11% due to this (seemingly irrelevant) tokenization variation as well
as reshuffled model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM
comparisons in prior work. Surprisingly, we are able to recommend one specific
strategy -- tokenizing the space together with the answer letter -- as we
observe consistent and statistically significant performance improvements.
Additionally, it improves model calibration, enhancing the reliability of the
model's confidence estimates. Our findings underscore the importance of careful
evaluation design and highlight the need for standardized, transparent
evaluation protocols to ensure reliable and comparable results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM在文本重写任务中的行为，特别是针对论点改进（ArgImp）的任务。提出了一个包含57个指标的评估管道，用于检查LLM重写论点的质量，并比较不同LLM在此任务上的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在一般文本生成任务上得到了广泛研究，但关于文本重写任务的研究较少，特别是关于模型在此任务上的行为。

Method: 我们提出了CLEAR：一个包含57个指标的评估管道，这些指标映射到四个语言层次：词汇、句法、语义和语用。

Result: 通过考虑所有四个语言层次，我们发现模型通过缩短文本同时增加平均单词长度和合并句子来执行ArgImp。

Conclusion: 我们注意到说服力和连贯性维度有所提高。

Abstract: While LLMs have been extensively studied on general text generation tasks,
there is less research on text rewriting, a task related to general text
generation, and particularly on the behavior of models on this task. In this
paper we analyze what changes LLMs make in a text rewriting setting. We focus
specifically on argumentative texts and their improvement, a task named
Argument Improvement (ArgImp). We present CLEAR: an evaluation pipeline
consisting of 57 metrics mapped to four linguistic levels: lexical, syntactic,
semantic and pragmatic. This pipeline is used to examine the qualities of
LLM-rewritten arguments on a broad set of argumentation corpora and compare the
behavior of different LLMs on this task and analyze the behavior of different
LLMs on this task in terms of linguistic levels. By taking all four linguistic
levels into consideration, we find that the models perform ArgImp by shortening
the texts while simultaneously increasing average word length and merging
sentences. Overall we note an increase in the persuasion and coherence
dimensions.

*Ayan Sengupta,Siddhant Chaudhary,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CurDKV is a novel value-centric KV compression method that improves accuracy and reduces latency in autoregressive language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods rely on query-key attention scores, which may not accurately reflect semantic importance due to the exclusion of value vectors.

Method: CurDKV uses leverage scores from CUR matrix decomposition to select keys and values, approximating the dominant subspace of the attention output.

Result: CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA and Mistral, while reducing generation latency by up to 40% at high compression.

Conclusion: CurDKV achieves higher accuracy and reduces generation latency compared to existing methods, offering a practical speed-accuracy tradeoff.

Abstract: Key-value (KV) cache compression has emerged as a critical technique for
reducing the memory and latency overhead of autoregressive language models
during inference. Prior approaches predominantly rely on query-key attention
scores to rank and evict cached tokens, assuming that attention intensity
correlates with semantic importance. However, this heuristic overlooks the
contribution of value vectors, which directly influence the attention output.
In this paper, we propose CurDKV, a novel, value-centric KV compression method
that selects keys and values based on leverage scores computed from CUR matrix
decomposition. Our approach approximates the dominant subspace of the attention
output $softmax(QK^T)V$, ensuring that the retained tokens best preserve the
model's predictive behavior. Theoretically, we show that attention score
approximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that
CUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss.
Empirically, CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art
methods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA
and Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped
Query Attention. In addition to improved accuracy, CurDKV reduces generation
latency by up to 40% at high compression, offering a practical speed-accuracy
tradeoff.

Motivation: 由于缺乏高质量数据和语言特定模型，低资源语言的自然语言理解仍然是 NLP 的主要挑战。Maithili 语言虽然有数百万使用者，但缺乏计算资源，限制了其在数字和 AI 驱动应用中的使用。

Method: maiBERT 是通过 MLM 技术在新构建的 Maithili 语料库上预训练的 BERT 基础语言模型。

Result: maiBERT 在新闻分类任务中达到了 87.02% 的准确率，优于现有的区域模型如 NepBERTa 和 HindiBERT，整体准确率提高了 0.13%，各类别提高了 5-7%。

Conclusion: maiBERT 是一个针对 Maithili 语言的 BERT 基础语言模型，通过 MLM 技术进行预训练，并在新闻分类任务中取得了优于现有区域模型的结果。我们已经将 maiBERT 开源，以便于进一步微调用于下游任务。

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for low-resource languages remains a
major challenge in NLP due to the scarcity of high-quality data and
language-specific models. Maithili, despite being spoken by millions, lacks
adequate computational resources, limiting its inclusion in digital and
AI-driven applications. To address this gap, we introducemaiBERT, a BERT-based
language model pre-trained specifically for Maithili using the Masked Language
Modeling (MLM) technique. Our model is trained on a newly constructed Maithili
corpus and evaluated through a news classification task. In our experiments,
maiBERT achieved an accuracy of 87.02%, outperforming existing regional models
like NepBERTa and HindiBERT, with a 0.13% overall accuracy gain and 5-7%
improvement across various classes. We have open-sourced maiBERT on Hugging
Face enabling further fine-tuning for downstream tasks such as sentiment
analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的开放关系抽取框架，该框架能够直接预测测试实例的新关系，而无需人工干预。实验结果表明，该框架在三个开放关系抽取数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The goal of open relation extraction (OpenRE) is to develop an RE model that
can generalize to new relations not encountered during training. Existing
studies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all
test instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually
assign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human
annotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE
framework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new
relations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding
and generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our
framework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),
designed to predict new relations for test instances based on
\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and
(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a
test instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \textit{demonstrations}
composed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict
new relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three
stages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the
first stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test
instances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for
each new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation
method. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all
test instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test
instances. Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. We release our code at
https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/LLM-OREF.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一个有争议的测试是大型语言模型能否辨别可能的和不可能的语言。虽然有一些证据表明模型对跨过语法不可能语言界限的敏感性，但这些证据因测试材料的合理性而受到质疑。

Method: 我们使用模型内部表示来直接探索大型语言模型如何表示'语法正确-不语法正确'的区别。我们在一个新基准上从4个模型中提取概率，并计算最小对数意外差异，将语法句子的概率与（i）低频率语法句子、（ii）不语法句子、（iii）语义奇怪句子和（iv）语用奇怪句子的概率进行对比。

Result: 我们的结果没有显示出不语法提示的独特意外签名，因为语义和语用奇怪条件始终表现出更高的意外率。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，概率不能作为模型内部语法知识表示的可靠代理。因此，关于模型能够区分可能和不可能语言的主张需要通过不同的方法进行验证。

Abstract: A controversial test for Large Language Models concerns the ability to
discern possible from impossible language. While some evidence attests to the
models' sensitivity to what crosses the limits of grammatically impossible
language, this evidence has been contested on the grounds of the soundness of
the testing material. We use model-internal representations to tap directly
into the way Large Language Models represent the 'grammatical-ungrammatical'
distinction. In a novel benchmark, we elicit probabilities from 4 models and
compute minimal-pair surprisal differences, juxtaposing probabilities assigned
to grammatical sentences to probabilities assigned to (i) lower frequency
grammatical sentences, (ii) ungrammatical sentences, (iii) semantically odd
sentences, and (iv) pragmatically odd sentences. The prediction is that if
string-probabilities can function as proxies for the limits of grammar, the
ungrammatical condition will stand out among the conditions that involve
linguistic violations, showing a spike in the surprisal rates. Our results do
not reveal a unique surprisal signature for ungrammatical prompts, as the
semantically and pragmatically odd conditions consistently show higher
surprisal. We thus demonstrate that probabilities do not constitute reliable
proxies for model-internal representations of syntactic knowledge.
Consequently, claims about models being able to distinguish possible from
impossible language need verification through a different methodology.

TL;DR: A1 is a framework that improves test-time scaling in large language models by addressing synchronization, memory, and latency issues, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for test-time scaling in large language models face significant challenges, including severe synchronization overhead, memory bottlenecks, and latency, especially during speculative decoding with long reasoning chains.

Method: A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline that supports both sequential and parallel scaling.

Result: A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone.

Conclusion: A1 is an efficient and principled solution for scalable LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) benefit from test-time scaling, but existing
methods face significant challenges, including severe synchronization overhead,
memory bottlenecks, and latency, especially during speculative decoding with
long reasoning chains. We introduce A1 (Asynchronous Test-Time Scaling), a
statistically guaranteed adaptive inference framework that addresses these
challenges. A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the
dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable
asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline
that supports both sequential and parallel scaling. Through experiments on the

families, we demonstrate that A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in
test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining
accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no
accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone. These results
position A1 as an efficient and principled solution for scalable LLM inference.

*Huy Nghiem,Advik Sachdeva,Hal Daumé III*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SMARTER，一个数据高效的两阶段框架，用于使用大型语言模型进行可解释的内容审核。在第一阶段，利用LLMs自身输出生成合成解释，并通过偏好优化进行对齐。在第二阶段，通过跨模型训练提高解释质量。实验表明，SMARTER在三个基准任务上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有毒内容在社交媒体平台上变得无处不在，需要一种高效且可解释的内容审核方法。

Method: SMARTER是一个数据高效的两阶段框架，用于使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行可解释的内容审核。在第一阶段，我们利用LLMs自身的输出生成正确和错误标签的合成解释，通过偏好优化进行对齐，只需最少的人工监督。在第二阶段，通过跨模型训练提高解释质量，使较弱的模型在风格和语义上与较强的模型对齐。

Result: 在三个基准任务（HateXplain、Latent Hate和Implicit Hate）上的实验表明，SMARTER使LLMs在仅使用少量完整训练数据的情况下，相比标准的少样本基线，宏F1得分提高了高达13.5%。

Conclusion: 我们的框架提供了一种可扩展的策略，通过利用大型语言模型的自我改进能力来实现分类和解释，适用于低资源环境。

Abstract: WARNING: This paper contains examples of offensive materials. Toxic content
has become pervasive on social media platforms. We introduce SMARTER, a
data-efficient two-stage framework for explainable content moderation using
Large Language Models (LLMs). In Stage 1, we leverage LLMs' own outputs to
generate synthetic explanations for both correct and incorrect labels, enabling
alignment via preference optimization with minimal human supervision. In Stage
2, we refine explanation quality through cross-model training, allowing weaker
models to align stylistically and semantically with stronger ones. Experiments
on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate --
demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1
improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the
full training data. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource
settings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both
classification and explanation.

*Yeongbin Seo,Dongha Lee,Jaehyung Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于归一化的卷积解码方法和一种后训练方案，以解决扩散语言模型中的长解码窗口问题，并在开放生成基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散语言模型存在长解码窗口问题，其中远离输入上下文的标记往往变得无关或重复。之前的解决方案如半自回归通过将窗口分成块来解决这个问题，但牺牲了速度和双向性，消除了扩散模型的主要优势。

Method: 我们提出了卷积解码（Conv），这是一种基于归一化的方法，可以在不进行硬分割的情况下缩小解码窗口，从而提高流畅性和灵活性。此外，我们引入了拒绝规则微调（R2FT），这是一种后训练方案，可以更好地对齐远离上下文的位置的标记。

Result: 我们的方法在开放生成基准测试中达到了最先进的结果，同时显著降低了步骤大小，证明了速度和质量的提升。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在开放生成基准测试中达到了最先进的结果，同时显著降低了步骤大小，证明了速度和质量的提升。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which
limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising
alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we
identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window
problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become
irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address
this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and
bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To
overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based
method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to
better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based
Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at
positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on
open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM
baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works,
demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.

*Irina Proskurina,Guillaume Metzler,Julien Velcin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Fair-GPTQ，一种显式设计以减少大型语言模型不公平性的量化方法，结果表明它在保持性能的同时有效降低了不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高内存需求的生成语言模型引起了对量化技术的关注，该技术通过将模型权重映射到低精度整数来降低计算成本、内存使用和延迟。然而，最近的实证研究表明，它们可能会增加有偏输出并降低公平性基准的表现，且尚不清楚哪些特定权重会导致此问题。

Method: 通过在量化目标中添加显式的群体公平性约束，引入了Fair-GPTQ，这是第一个专门设计以减少大型语言模型不公平性的量化方法。

Result: Fair-GPTQ对性能影响最小，在零样本基准测试中至少保留了90%的基线准确性，相对于半精度模型减少了不公平性，并保留了4位量化内存和速度优势。与现有去偏方法相比，它在种族刻板印象基准测试中实现了与迭代空空间投影去偏方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 结果验证了我们在量化问题中加入群体偏差项的理论解决方案，突显了其在生成模型量化时减少群体偏差的适用性，并表明我们的方法可以进一步用于分析量化过程中的通道和权重级公平性贡献。

Abstract: High memory demands of generative language models have drawn attention to
quantization, which reduces computational cost, memory usage, and latency by
mapping model weights to lower-precision integers. Approaches such as GPTQ
effectively minimize input-weight product errors during quantization; however,
recent empirical studies show that they can increase biased outputs and degrade
performance on fairness benchmarks, and it remains unclear which specific
weights cause this issue. In this work, we draw new links between quantization
and model fairness by adding explicit group-fairness constraints to the
quantization objective and introduce Fair-GPTQ, the first quantization method
explicitly designed to reduce unfairness in large language models. The added
constraints guide the learning of the rounding operation toward less-biased
text generation for protected groups. Specifically, we focus on stereotype
generation involving occupational bias and discriminatory language spanning
gender, race, and religion. Fair-GPTQ has minimal impact on performance,
preserving at least 90% of baseline accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks, reduces
unfairness relative to a half-precision model, and retains the memory and speed
benefits of 4-bit quantization. We also compare the performance of Fair-GPTQ
with existing debiasing methods and find that it achieves performance on par
with the iterative null-space projection debiasing approach on
racial-stereotype benchmarks. Overall, the results validate our theoretical
solution to the quantization problem with a group-bias term, highlight its
applicability for reducing group bias at quantization time in generative
models, and demonstrate that our approach can further be used to analyze
channel- and weight-level contributions to fairness during quantization.

Abstract: Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between
presentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying
information in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature,
combining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented
generation systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream
performance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate
indexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual
information. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide
retrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the
use of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense
retrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods
like Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning
pipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding
storage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside
comparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects
of these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands
alongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the
selection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for
real-world applications.

Abstract: Traditional efforts to measure historical structural oppression struggle with
cross-national validity due to the unique, locally specified histories of
exclusion, colonization, and social status in each country, and often have
relied on structured indices that privilege material resources while
overlooking lived, identity-based exclusion. We introduce a novel framework for
oppression measurement that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
context-sensitive scores of lived historical disadvantage across diverse
geopolitical settings. Using unstructured self-identified ethnicity utterances
from a multilingual COVID-19 global study, we design rule-guided prompting
strategies that encourage models to produce interpretable, theoretically
grounded estimations of oppression. We systematically evaluate these strategies
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when
guided by explicit rules, can capture nuanced forms of identity-based
historical oppression within nations. This approach provides a complementary
measurement tool that highlights dimensions of systemic exclusion, offering a
scalable, cross-cultural lens for understanding how oppression manifests in
data-driven research and public health contexts. To support reproducible
evaluation, we release an open-sourced benchmark dataset for assessing LLMs on
oppression measurement

Motivation: 由于在大型语言模型（LLMs）开发过程中数据污染几乎不可避免，训练数据常常无意中整合了评估基准，这使得公平地对LLMs进行基准测试变得困难。因此，需要一种有效的解决方案来恢复模型性能。

Result: 本文框架在多个存在潜在泄露风险的数据集上表现出色，并且在不同模型和不同数据污染程度下都能稳定恢复模型性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为LNE-Blocking的新框架，用于在潜在泄露数据集上恢复模型性能。该框架能够有效恢复模型的贪婪解码性能，并在多个存在潜在泄露风险的数据集上表现出色，且在不同模型和不同数据污染程度下都能保持稳定的恢复结果。

Abstract: The problem of data contamination is now almost inevitable during the
development of large language models (LLMs), with the training data commonly
integrating those evaluation benchmarks even unintentionally. This problem
subsequently makes it hard to benchmark LLMs fairly. Instead of constructing
contamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework,
\textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on
potentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components:
contamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework
first uses the contamination detection method, \textbf{LNE}, to assess the
extent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity
of the disruption operation, \textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized
responses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the
model's greedy decoding performance. This comes with a strong performance on
multiple datasets with potential leakage risks, and it consistently achieves
stable recovery results across different models and varying levels of data
contamination. We release the code at https://github.com/RuijieH/LNE-Blocking
to facilitate research.

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored

TL;DR: MARIC is a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process, which significantly outperforms baselines in image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs) alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of visual content.

Method: MARIC is a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process. It utilizes an Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step, producing a unified representation for classification.

Result: Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and interpretable image classification.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了AIP攻击，通过操纵指令提示来影响RAG输出，揭示了RAG系统中的关键漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击主要依赖于操纵用户查询，这在实际中往往不可行，因此需要关注更现实且隐蔽的攻击向量——指令提示。

Method: 提出了一种基于遗传算法的联合优化方法，以平衡攻击成功率、干净任务效用和隐蔽性，从而生成对抗性指令提示。

Result: AIP在保持良性功能的同时，达到了高达95.23%的ASR（攻击成功率）。

Conclusion: AIP揭示了RAG系统中一个之前被忽视的关键漏洞，强调需要重新评估共享的指令提示。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，利用视觉和音频模态在对话中生成引人入胜的语音是有效的。

Abstract: Human conversation involves language, speech, and visual cues, with each
medium providing complementary information. For instance, speech conveys a vibe
or tone not fully captured by text alone. While multimodal LLMs focus on
generating text responses from diverse inputs, less attention has been paid to
generating natural and engaging speech. We propose a human-like agent that
generates speech responses based on conversation mood and responsive style
information. To achieve this, we build a novel MultiSensory Conversation
dataset focused on speech to enable agents to generate natural speech. We then
propose a multimodal LLM-based model for generating text responses and voice
descriptions, which are used to generate speech covering paralinguistic
information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing
both visual and audio modalities in conversation to generate engaging speech.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
increasingly sophisticated autonomous visualization agents capable of
translating user intentions into data visualizations. However, measuring
progress and comparing different agents remains challenging, particularly in
scientific visualization (SciVis), due to the absence of comprehensive,
large-scale benchmarks for evaluating real-world capabilities. This position
paper examines the various types of evaluation required for SciVis agents,
outlines the associated challenges, provides a simple proof-of-concept
evaluation example, and discusses how evaluation benchmarks can facilitate
agent self-improvement. We advocate for a broader collaboration to develop a
SciVis agentic evaluation benchmark that would not only assess existing
capabilities but also drive innovation and stimulate future development in the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在澄清MDMs的理论基础，并通过提出一种新的能量启发的调度方法来改进采样性能，特别是在低步数采样设置中。

Method: 本文通过证明三种不同的能量形式——动能、条件动能和测地线能量——在MDMs结构下是数学等价的，提出了一个理论框架。此外，通过使用Beta分布参数化插值调度，将调度设计空间简化为可处理的二维搜索，从而实现了无需修改模型的高效后训练调整。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于能量的调度方法在合成和现实世界基准测试中优于手工设计的基线方法，尤其是在低步数采样设置中表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文通过将掩码扩散模型（MDMs）解释为离散最优传输中的能量最小化问题，提供了一个系统的理论框架。MDMs在满足特定的闭式最优条件时，能够最小化三种不同的能量形式，这不仅澄清了MDMs的理论基础，还推动了采样方面的实际改进。

Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked
diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in
discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy
formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are
mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize
all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition.
This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but
also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing
interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design
space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without
model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted
baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种针对工具学习中多任务结构和细粒度奖励机制的动态采样框架DSCL，实验结果表明DSCL在训练效率和模型性能上优于强基线，取得了3.29%的提升。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool
learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple
samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.
Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task
structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This
paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework
specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique
characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and
multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based
Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and
variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum
Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training

*Dan Zhang,Min Cai,Jonathan Li,Ziniu Hu,Yisong Yue,Yuxiao Dong,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TDRM is a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training, which improves the performance of language model policies and achieves data-efficient RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training.

Method: TDRM is a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training.

Result: Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N and tree-search settings. When combined with RLVR, TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL and yield higher-quality language model policies on multiple model variants.

Conclusion: TDRM is a effective method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models, which can improve the performance of language model policies and achieve data-efficient RL.

Abstract: Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language
models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often
lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable
RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more
reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This
temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves
alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic
style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that
TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in
series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve
performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%)
settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable
performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to
attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants
(5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414,
Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B). We release

*Shiwan Zhao,Xuyang Zhao,Jiaming Zhou,Aobo Kong,Qicheng Li,Yong Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种数据重写框架，以主动缩小策略差距，从而提高监督微调的稳定性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）大型语言模型可以被视为一个非策略学习问题，其中专家演示来自固定的行为策略，而训练旨在优化目标策略。重要性采样是纠正这种分布不匹配的标准工具，但大的策略差距会导致高方差和训练不稳定。现有的方法使用KL惩罚或裁剪来缓解这个问题，这些方法被动地限制更新而不是主动减少差距。

Method: 提出了一种简单而有效的数据重写框架，通过保留正确的解决方案作为策略数据，并用引导重新求解来重写错误的解决方案，在需要时回退到专家演示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在五个数学推理基准上取得了持续且显著的提升。

Conclusion: 实验表明，该方法在五个数学推理基准上相对于普通的SFT和最先进的动态微调（DFT）方法都有显著的提升。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models can be viewed as an
off-policy learning problem, where expert demonstrations come from a fixed
behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance
sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but
large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing
approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively
constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple
yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap
by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones
with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed.
This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before
optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy
fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released at
https://github.com/NKU-HLT/Off-Policy-SFT.

*Yujun Zhou,Zhenwen Liang,Haolin Liu,Wenhao Yu,Kishan Panaganti,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xiangliang Zhang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVOL-RL is a label-free reinforcement learning method that prevents entropy collapse by combining stability and variation, improving model performance and generalization across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing label-free methods stabilize learning but cause entropy collapse, making generations shorter, less diverse, and brittle. The goal is to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability.

Method: EVOL-RL couples stability with variation under a label-free setting by keeping the majority-voted answer as a stable anchor while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced, measured in semantic space. It uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer to sustain search.

Result: EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. It prevents diversity collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and improves both pass@1 and pass@n.

Conclusion: EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks stronger generalization across domains and boosts performance in the RLVR setting, highlighting its broad applicability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands
models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing
label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote
objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an
entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike
prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which
primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is
broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's
inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We
formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free
Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with
variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer
as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors
responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced
(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also
uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer
to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design
prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and
improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the
majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts
Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%
to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks
stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,
highlighting its broad applicability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FlowRL，通过匹配完整的奖励分布而不是最大化奖励来提高大型语言模型强化学习中的探索效率和推理多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近先进的推理模型采用奖励最大化方法（例如PPO和GRPO），这往往过度优化主导的奖励信号，而忽略了较少出现但有效的推理路径，从而降低了多样性。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于流平衡的优化方法，通过最小化策略与目标分布之间的反向KL散度来促进多样化的探索和可推广的推理轨迹。

Result: FlowRL在数学和代码推理任务上的实验结果显示，其在数学基准测试中平均改进幅度分别为10.0%（相对于GRPO）和5.1%（相对于PPO），并在代码推理任务中表现一致更好。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了奖励分布匹配在大型语言模型强化学习中实现高效探索和多样化推理的关键作用。

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing
instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods
(\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while
neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In
contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution
using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL
divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this
idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration
and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and
code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of
$10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs
consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward
distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse
reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Spatial audio reasoning enables machines to interpret auditory scenes by
understanding events and their spatial attributes. In this work, we focus on
spatial audio understanding with an emphasis on reasoning about moving sources.
First, we introduce a spatial audio encoder that processes spatial audio to
detect multiple overlapping events and estimate their spatial attributes,
Direction of Arrival (DoA) and source distance, at the frame level. To
generalize to unseen events, we incorporate an audio grounding model that
aligns audio features with semantic audio class text embeddings via a
cross-attention mechanism. Second, to answer complex queries about dynamic
audio scenes involving moving sources, we condition a large language model
(LLM) on structured spatial attributes extracted by our model. Finally, we
introduce a spatial audio motion understanding and reasoning benchmark dataset
and demonstrate our framework's performance against the baseline model.

TL;DR: 本文评估了基于LLM的代理在渗透测试中的表现，并通过增强五种核心功能能力来提高其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）被越来越多地用于自动化或增强渗透测试，但它们在攻击阶段的有效性和可靠性仍然不明确。

Method: 我们对多个基于LLM的代理进行了全面评估，从单代理到模块化设计，在现实的渗透测试场景中测量了经验性能和重复失败模式。我们还通过有针对性的增强来隔离五个核心功能能力的影响：全局上下文记忆（GCM）、代理间消息传递（IAM）、上下文条件调用（CCI）、自适应规划（AP）和实时监控（RTM）。

Result: 我们的结果表明，虽然某些架构天然表现出这些属性的子集，但有针对性的增强显著提高了模块化代理的性能，特别是在复杂、多步骤和实时渗透测试任务中。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，虽然某些架构天然表现出这些属性的子集，但有针对性的增强显著提高了模块化代理的性能，特别是在复杂、多步骤和实时渗透测试任务中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment
penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack
phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple
LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic
penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring
failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional
capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM),
Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive
Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support,
respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component
coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective
execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery,
and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some
architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted
augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in
complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.

Motivation: 现有数据集在任务分解和关键词提取方面存在不足，限制了其有效性。

Method: 提出了一种基于RAG的NL2SQL管道DeKeySQL，该管道包含三个不同的模块：用户问题理解、实体检索和生成。

Result: 使用DeKeyNLU微调后，BIRD和Spider开发数据集上的SQL生成准确率分别从62.31%提升到69.10%，从84.2%提升到88.7%。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，使用DeKeyNLU进行微调显著提高了在BIRD和Spider开发数据集上的SQL生成准确性。

Abstract: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that
simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural
language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance.
However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword
extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL
generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning
models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of
domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500
meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and
enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with
DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three
distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and
generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model
configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate
that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy
on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought

are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying
Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human

annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions
to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify).
The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained
analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed
annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in
LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This
framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM
cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent

Motivation: Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains requires balancing strict confidentiality with model utility and safety.

Method: FedMentor is a federated fine-tuning framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining performance.

Result: In experiments on three mental health datasets, FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound.

Conclusion: FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive
domains (e.g., mental health) requires balancing strict confidentiality with
model utility and safety. We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning
framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware
Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining
performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional
to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility
falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we
show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning without
privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity,
while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the
non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework
scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring
< 173 MB of communication per round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical
approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and
other sensitive fields.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究了多代理LLM系统中组合性隐私泄露的问题，并提出了两种防御策略：理解心智防御（ToM）和协作共识防御（CoDef）。实验表明，CoDef在平衡隐私和效用方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）成为多代理系统的核心，新的隐私风险出现，这些风险超越了记忆、直接推理或单次评估。特别是，看似无害的响应，当跨交互组合时，可以累积地使对手恢复敏感信息，我们称之为组合性隐私泄露。

Method: 我们开发了一个框架，该框架模型如何通过辅助知识和代理交互共同放大隐私风险，即使每个响应在孤立时是无害的。我们提出了两种防御策略：(1) 理解心智防御（ToM），其中防御者代理通过预测其输出可能被对手利用的方式来推断提问者的意图；(2) 协作共识防御（CoDef），其中响应代理与同伴合作，基于共享聚合状态进行投票以限制敏感信息的传播。

Result: 我们的实验量化了这些防御策略在平衡隐私-效用权衡方面的差异。我们发现，虽然思维链单独对泄漏提供有限的保护（约39%的敏感阻止率），但我们的ToM防御显著提高了敏感查询阻止（高达97%），但可能会降低良性任务的成功率。CoDef实现了最佳平衡，产生了最高的平衡结果（79.8%），突显了结合显式推理与防御者协作的好处。

Conclusion: 我们的结果揭示了协作LLM部署中的新风险，并为设计防止组合性、上下文驱动隐私泄露的保障措施提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to multi-agent systems, new
privacy risks emerge that extend beyond memorization, direct inference, or
single-turn evaluations. In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when
composed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover
sensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We
present the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and
possible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a
framework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly
amplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to
mitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)
Theory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent
by anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)
Collaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate
with peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive
information spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions
that expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign
inferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in
balancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought
alone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our
ToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can
reduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the
highest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining
explicit reasoning with defender collaboration. Together, our results expose a
new class of risks in collaborative LLM deployments and provide actionable
insights for designing safeguards against compositional, context-driven privacy
leakage.

Abstract: Safety alignment aims to prevent Large Language Models (LLMs) from responding
to harmful queries. To strengthen safety protections, jailbreak methods are
developed to simulate malicious attacks and uncover vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we introduce HILL (Hiding Intention by Learning from LLMs), a novel
jailbreak approach that systematically transforms imperative harmful requests
into learning-style questions with only straightforward hypotheticality
indicators. Further, we introduce two new metrics to thoroughly evaluate the
utility of jailbreak methods. Experiments on the AdvBench dataset across a wide
range of models demonstrate HILL's strong effectiveness, generalizability, and
harmfulness. It achieves top attack success rates on the majority of models and
across malicious categories while maintaining high efficiency with concise
prompts. Results of various defense methods show the robustness of HILL, with
most defenses having mediocre effects or even increasing the attack success
rates. Moreover, the assessment on our constructed safe prompts reveals
inherent limitations of LLMs' safety mechanisms and flaws in defense methods.
This work exposes significant vulnerabilities of safety measures against

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance security through alignment when widely
used, but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks capable of producing
inappropriate content. Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating
jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model
inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs.
In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output
distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for
detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak
Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and
scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and
benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we
enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual
instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD
can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional
computational costs during LLM inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become key components of modern software,
with prompts acting as their de-facto programming interface. However, prompt
design remains largely empirical and small mistakes can cascade into
unreliable, insecure, or inefficient behavior. This paper presents the first
systematic survey and taxonomy of prompt defects, recurring ways that prompts
fail to elicit their intended behavior from LLMs. We organize defects along six
dimensions: (1) Specification and Intent, (2) Input and Content, (3) Structure
and Formatting, (4) Context and Memory, (5) Performance and Efficiency, and (6)
Maintainability and Engineering. Each dimension is refined into fine-grained
subtypes, illustrated with concrete examples and root cause analysis. Grounded
in software engineering principles, we show how these defects surface in real
development workflows and examine their downstream effects. For every subtype,
we distill mitigation strategies that span emerging prompt engineering
patterns, automated guardrails, testing harnesses, and evaluation frameworks.
We then summarize these strategies in a master taxonomy that links defect,
impact, and remedy. We conclude with open research challenges and a call for
rigorous engineering-oriented methodologies to ensure that LLM-driven systems
are dependable by design.

Abstract: Paralinguistic sounds, like laughter and sighs, are crucial for synthesizing
more realistic and engaging speech. However, existing methods typically depend
on proprietary datasets, while publicly available resources often suffer from
incomplete speech, inaccurate or missing timestamps, and limited real-world
relevance. To address these problems, we propose an automated framework for
generating large-scale paralinguistic data and apply it to construct the
SynParaSpeech dataset. The dataset comprises 6 paralinguistic categories with
118.75 hours of data and precise timestamps, all derived from natural
conversational speech. Our contributions lie in introducing the first automated
method for constructing large-scale paralinguistic datasets and releasing the
SynParaSpeech corpus, which advances speech generation through more natural
paralinguistic synthesis and enhances speech understanding by improving
paralinguistic event detection. The dataset and audio samples are available at
https://github.com/ShawnPi233/SynParaSpeech.
