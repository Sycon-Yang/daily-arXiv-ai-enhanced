### [1] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为McBE的多任务中文偏见评估基准，用于评估大型语言模型中的偏见。该基准包含4077个实例，覆盖12个单一偏见类别和82个子类别，并引入了5个评估任务。评估结果显示，所有测试的大型语言模型都表现出不同程度的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏见评估数据集主要针对英语和北美文化，其偏见类别不适用于其他文化。此外，这些数据集通常只支持单个评估任务，无法从多个方面评估大型语言模型中的偏见。因此，需要一个更全面的中文偏见评估基准。

Method: 本文提出了一个名为McBE的多任务中文偏见评估基准，包含4077个偏见评估实例，覆盖12个单一偏见类别、82个子类别，并引入了5个评估任务。此外，还评估了几种不同系列和参数大小的流行大型语言模型。

Result: 本文提出的McBE包含4077个偏见评估实例，覆盖12个单一偏见类别、82个子类别，并引入了5个评估任务。评估结果显示，所有测试的大型语言模型都表现出不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个全面的多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），并评估了多种流行的大型语言模型，发现它们都表现出不同程度的偏见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对最先进的推理LLM和非推理LLM在对话摘要任务中的表现进行了全面评估，发现显式的逐步推理并不总能提高摘要质量，反而可能导致冗长和不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话摘要是一个具有重要实际价值的挑战性任务，在客户服务、会议分析和对话AI中都有应用。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在摘要任务中取得了显著进展，但步骤推理架构（特别是Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 实现）在需要同时抽象和简洁的对话场景中的表现仍未被探索。

Method: 我们对最先进的推理LLM和非推理LLM进行了全面和系统的评估，涵盖了三种主要范式：通用、角色导向和查询导向的对话摘要。

Result: 我们的研究发现，显式的逐步推理并不总是能提高对话摘要的质量。相反，推理LLM往往比非推理LLM更容易出现冗长、事实不一致和不够简洁的摘要。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了对当前推理LLM局限性的新见解，并强调了针对现实世界对话摘要的目标建模和评估策略的必要性。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

### [3] [Latent Chain-of-Thought? Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02199)
*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Huginn-3.5B模型是否能在潜在空间中内化链式思维，并发现其效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索循环架构是否能将推理过程内化在潜在空间中，从而支持潜在的链式思维（CoT）。

Method: 使用了一系列探测技术，包括Logit Lens和Coda Lens，来检查Huginn-3.5B模型在算术任务中的内部行为。

Result: 研究发现了有限的可解释潜在CoT证据，并发现了循环块之间的显著探测不一致现象。

Conclusion: 研究发现，增加循环深度带来的收益有限，远不及那些显式外部化推理步骤的模型。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

### [4] [GDC Cohort Copilot: An AI Copilot for Curating Cohorts from the Genomic Data Commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02221)
*Steven Song,Anirudh Subramanyam,Zhenyu Zhang,Aarti Venkat,Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot 是一个开源工具，可以将自然语言描述转换为 GDC 队列过滤器，提高用户创建特定队列的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDC 用户（尤其是新用户）可能难以在数百个可能的字段和属性中找到特定的队列描述符，但用户可能更擅长用自然语言描述他们所需的队列。

Method: 开发并评估了多个大型语言模型（LLMs）用于 GDC Cohort Copilot，并展示了本地服务的开源 GDC Cohort LLM 在生成 GDC 队列方面优于 GPT-4o 提示。

Result: GDC Cohort Copilot 可以自动根据用户输入的自然语言描述生成 GDC 队列过滤器，并允许用户通过交互式界面进一步优化生成的队列。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot 是一个用于从 GDC 中策划队列的开源助手工具，能够根据用户输入的自然语言描述自动生成 GDC 队列过滤器，并在本地部署的 GDC Cohort LLM 上表现出优于 GPT-4o 的性能。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

### [5] [MemAgent: Reshaping Long-Context LLM with Multi-Conv RL-based Memory Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02259)
*Hongli Yu,Tinghong Chen,Jiangtao Feng,Jiangjie Chen,Weinan Dai,Qiying Yu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Jingjing Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Hao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出MemAgent，一种用于处理长文本的新代理工作流，能够有效处理无限长文档并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有长度外推、高效注意力和记忆模块的改进，但在不降低性能的情况下以线性复杂度处理无限长文档仍然是长期文本处理的最终挑战。

Method: 引入了一种新的代理工作流MemAgent，通过分段阅读文本并使用覆盖策略更新内存来处理长文本任务。同时扩展了DAPO算法以通过独立上下文多对话生成进行训练。

Result: MemAgent在从8K上下文训练的32K文本中进行外推，在3.5M QA任务中性能损失小于5%，并在512K RULER测试中达到95%以上。

Conclusion: MemAgent展示了出色的长上下文能力，能够在3.5M QA任务中保持性能损失小于5%，并在512K RULER测试中达到95%以上的成绩。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

### [6] [DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02302)
*Dohoon Kim,Donghun Kang,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DoMIX的新方法，利用LoRA模块解决持续DAP方法的局限性，实现了高效、并行的领域自适应预训练，并能提供针对特定任务的定制化预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续DAP方法存在高计算成本、对增量数据顺序敏感以及提供单一通用模型的问题，这与DAP的本质相矛盾。因此，需要一种新的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 本文提出的方法DoMIX利用了LoRA模块，这是一种参数高效的微调（PEFT）方法，以解决现有持续DAP方法中的计算成本高、对增量数据顺序敏感以及提供单一通用模型的问题。

Result: 本文提出的DoMIX方法能够实现高效、并行的领域自适应预训练，对领域顺序具有鲁棒性，并能有效利用累积知识，为特定任务提供定制化的预训练模型。此外，该方法还可以扩展到标准LLM微调场景中。

Conclusion: 本文提出了DoMIX方法，通过利用LoRA模块解决了现有持续DAP方法的局限性，实现了高效、并行的领域自适应预训练，并能提供针对特定任务的定制化预训练模型。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

### [8] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT是一种混合量子-经典变换器，通过用基于PQC的层替换FFN模块来提高表达能力和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFN模块占标准Transformer编码器块中参数的约三分之二，因此将其替换为PQC-based层可以提高表达能力并减少参数数量。

Method: 引入了QFFN-BERT，这是一种混合量子-经典变换器，其中紧凑的BERT变体的前馈网络（FFN）模块被基于PQC的层取代。

Result: QFFN-BERT在全数据设置中达到了基准准确性的102.0%，超过了其经典对应物，并将FFN特定参数减少了超过99%。此外，在少样本学习场景中表现出一致且有竞争力的优势。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，当与基础深度学习原则共同设计时，PQCs可以作为强大且参数高效的经典FFN替代品。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

*Weijie Lyu,Sheng-Jun Huang,Xuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种利用参数化模型进行代码数据选择的方法，以提高训练效率和模型性能。实验结果表明，仅使用10K样本，我们的方法在HumanEval和MBPP上均优于92K全采样基线，有效提升了模型性能并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要通过利用大量数据来提高模型性能，关注数据数量而常常忽视数据质量，从而降低了训练效率。

Method: 我们引入了一种利用参数化模型进行代码数据选择的方法，以提高训练效率和模型性能。我们的方法优化了参数化模型，以确保所选子集内的分布一致性和多样性，保证高质量的数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅使用10K样本，我们的方法在HumanEval上比92K全采样基线提高了2.4%，在MBPP上提高了2.3%，在性能和效率方面都优于其他采样方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法有效提升了模型性能，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

### [10] [Benchmarking Akan ASR Models Across Domain-Specific Datasets: A Comparative Evaluation of Performance, Scalability, and Adaptability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02407)
*Mark Atta Mensah,Isaac Wiafe,Akon Ekpezu,Justice Kwame Appati,Jamal-Deen Abdulai,Akosua Nyarkoa Wiafe-Akenten,Frank Ernest Yeboah,Gifty Odame*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于Transformer架构的七个Akan ASR模型，并发现它们在不同领域中的表现存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有的自动语音识别（ASR）研究使用域内数据集评估模型，但很少评估它们在不同语音环境中的泛化能力。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本研究通过使用四个Akan语音语料库对基于Transformer架构的七个Akan ASR模型进行了基准测试，以确定它们的性能。

Result: 比较词错误率和字符错误率表明了领域依赖性，模型在其训练领域内表现最佳，而在不匹配场景中显示出显著的准确性下降。此外，Whisper和Wav2Vec2架构之间出现了不同的错误行为。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了针对特定领域适应技术、自适应路由策略和多语言训练框架的必要性，这对于Akan和其他低资源语言（LRL）来说至关重要。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Motivation: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on complex information-seeking benchmarks, which is previously unattainable.

Method: Generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO).

Result: WebSailor significantly outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Conclusion: WebSailor significantly outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

### [14] [Revisiting Active Learning under (Human) Label Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02593)
*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了人类标签变化在主动学习中的重要性，并提出了一种概念框架，以更好地反映现实标注的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度标注数据的获取仍然是应用监督学习的限制因素。尽管标签变化在自然语言处理中很常见，但标注框架通常仍基于单一真实标签的假设，这忽略了人类标签变化作为一种信息信号的可能性。主动学习虽然是一种优化有限标注预算的方法，但通常依赖于一些简化假设，这些假设在承认人类标签变化时很少成立。

Method: 本文调查了主动学习和人类标签变化社区如何处理或忽视这些区别，并提出了一个概念框架，将人类标签变化融入主动学习循环中，包括实例选择、标注者选择和标签表示。此外，还讨论了将大型语言模型作为标注者的整合。

Result: 本文分析了关于真实性和标签性质的基本假设，强调将观察到的标签变化分解为信号（如人类标签变化）和噪声（如标注错误）的必要性。提出了一个概念框架，用于在主动学习循环中包含人类标签变化，并讨论了大型语言模型作为标注者的整合。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为考虑人类标签变化的主动学习建立概念基础，更好地反映现实标注的复杂性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPF is a novel posttraining alignment framework for LLMs that mitigates bias by leveraging multiperspective generations and decomposing baselines into interpretable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for easy bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs).

Method: MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines by decomposing baseline into interpretable perspective components and guiding generation through sampling and balancing of responses.

Result: MPF aligns LLM sentiment distributions with both counterfactual baselines and the HR baseline, resulting in small KL divergence, reduction of calibration error, and generalization to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive prompt engineering or finetuning.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Motivation: 我们旨在研究性别与上下文偏差之间的相关性，特别是关注动作动词、物体名词和职业。

Method: 我们引入了一个新的数据集GenderLexicon和一个框架，可以估计上下文偏差及其相关的性别偏差。我们的模型可以通过评分来解释偏差，从而提高性别偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the correlation between gender and contextual
biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

TL;DR: 本研究通过元音模仿实验测量了人类元音生产中的‘刚好可产生差异’（JPD），发现其范围在14至51米耳之间，这对理解人类元音系统和语音产生的理论具有重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨人类元音生产中控制机制的准确性，特别是两个元音刺激在听觉空间中需要多远才能产生可靠的不同模仿。

Method: 研究使用了元音模仿范式来测量两个英语说话者在前元音产生中的‘刚好可产生差异’（JPD）。

Result: JPD被估计在F1 X F2空间中为14至51米耳之间。

Conclusion: 该研究发现，人类元音系统的可能结构可以通过设定两个元音音位在发音空间中的理论下限来澄清，并提供了对观察到的元音音位数量和模式的趋势的心理物理学解释。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [19] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型中的自我纠正盲点问题，发现大多数模型存在这一问题，并提出了一种方法来减少这种盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型已经变得具有变革性，但它们仍然会犯错并探索无成效的推理路径。自我纠正对于一个值得信赖的大型语言模型尤为重要，特别是自回归模型。然而，它们在自己的输出中未能纠正相同的错误，这表明存在一种系统性的'自我纠正盲点'。

Method: 本文引入了Self-Correction Bench框架，通过在三个复杂度级别上进行受控错误注入来系统研究这一现象。

Result: 测试14个模型后，发现平均有64.5%的盲点率。研究还发现，这种限制与训练数据组成有关：人类训练演示主要展示无错误的回应，而不是错误纠正序列，而RL训练的模型则通过结果反馈学习错误纠正。

Conclusion: 本文指出当前大型语言模型存在自我纠正盲点这一关键限制，并提出了可能的改进方向以提高其可靠性和可信度。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

TL;DR: 本文研究了推理语言模型（RLMs）在面对社会偏见时的鲁棒性。结果显示，具有显式推理能力的模型比基础模型更容易受到偏见激发，而推理增强的模型比依赖CoT提示的模型更安全。这些发现挑战了推理能提高鲁棒性的假设，并强调了需要更关注偏见的推理设计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理语言模型（RLMs）在执行复杂、多步骤推理任务方面表现出色，但它们对社会偏见的鲁棒性仍然不清楚。因此，本文旨在探讨RLMs在面对偏见激发时的表现，并评估不同推理机制的安全性。

Method: 本研究利用CLEAR-Bias基准测试，最初为大型语言模型（LLMs）设计，以研究RLMs对偏见激发的对抗鲁棒性。我们系统地评估了最先进的RLMs在多种社会文化维度上的表现，使用LLM作为评判者的方法进行自动安全评分，并利用越狱技术评估内置安全机制的强度。

Result: 研究结果显示，具有显式推理能力的模型（无论是通过CoT提示还是微调推理轨迹）通常比没有此类机制的基础模型更容易受到偏见激发。此外，推理增强的模型比依赖CoT提示的模型更安全，后者特别容易受到通过故事提示、虚构角色或奖励塑造指令进行的上下文重新框架攻击。

Conclusion: 研究发现，具有显式推理能力的模型（无论是通过CoT提示还是微调推理轨迹）通常比没有此类机制的基础模型更容易受到偏见激发，这表明推理可能会无意中为刻板印象强化打开新的途径。推理增强的模型比依赖CoT提示的模型更安全，后者特别容易受到通过故事提示、虚构角色或奖励塑造指令进行的上下文重新框架攻击。这些结果挑战了推理本质上能提高鲁棒性的假设，并强调了需要更加关注偏见的推理设计方法。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

Motivation: 当前的多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在数学推理中往往依赖于一对一的图像-文本对和单解决方案监督，忽略了有效推理视角和内部反思的多样性。

Method: 我们提出了Qwen-VL-DP，该模型基于Qwen-VL，通过监督学习进行微调，并通过组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行增强，这是一种结合正确性辨别和多样性感知奖励函数的规则强化学习方法。

Result: 在MathVista的minitest和Math-V基准测试中，Qwen-VL-DP显著优于之前的基线多模态语言模型，在准确性和生成多样性方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在准确性和生成多样性方面显著优于之前的基线多模态语言模型，突显了在多模态数学推理中融入多样视角和反思推理的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的动态路由框架SynapseRoute，能够根据问题复杂度将查询分配到适当的模式。实验结果显示，该框架在提高准确性的同时，显著降低了推理时间和令牌消耗，并引入了AIT指数来全面评估不同模式之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在实际应用中的广泛采用，选择合适的模型需要平衡性能和操作成本。然而，具有推理能力的模型进一步扩大了“思考”（高推理）和“非思考”（快速、低成本）模式之间的成本差距。因此，需要一种方法来动态地将查询路由到适当的模式，以优化准确性和成本效率。

Method: 本文提出了SynapseRoute框架，该框架基于机器学习，用于动态路由查询到适当的模式。同时，引入了AIT指数来评估不同模式之间的权衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，SynapseRoute在多个医学数据集上不仅提高了整体准确性（0.8390 vs. 0.8272），还减少了推理时间36.8%和令牌消耗39.66%。此外，定性分析表明，对简单查询的过度推理会导致不必要的延迟甚至准确性下降，而我们的自适应路由避免了这一问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的动态路由框架SynapseRoute，可以智能地将输入查询分配到思考模式或非思考模式。实验结果表明，SynapseRoute不仅提高了整体准确性，还减少了推理时间和令牌消耗。此外，本文引入了AIT指数来全面评估准确率、延迟和令牌成本之间的权衡。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Motivation: 当前最强的模型在遵循输出约束方面仍然存在困难，因此需要一个新的基准来评估模型在不同约束下的泛化能力，并探索如何改进模型的指令遵循能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用RLVR方法可以显著提高模型在精确指令遵循任务上的表现，同时IFBench基准能够有效评估模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个名为IFBench的新基准，用于评估精确指令遵循的泛化能力，并通过设计约束验证模块和使用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）显著提高了指令遵循能力。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了语言模型在使用用户反馈进行训练时的一个新漏洞，攻击者可以通过提供反馈来持久性地改变模型的行为，这可能带来严重的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示语言模型在使用用户反馈进行训练时存在的潜在漏洞，以及这种漏洞可能带来的安全威胁。

Method: 攻击者通过提示语言模型随机输出“中毒”或良性响应，并根据响应的好坏提供上赞或下赞反馈。当这些反馈信号用于后续的偏好调优时，语言模型在没有恶意提示的情况下也更有可能生成中毒响应。

Result: 实验表明，该攻击可以插入模型之前不存在的事实知识、修改代码生成模式以引入可利用的安全漏洞，以及注入虚假的财经新闻。

Conclusion: 本文发现了一种新的语言模型攻击机制，即通过用户反馈可以持久地改变语言模型的知识和行为。这种攻击方法表明，即使是有限的偏好数据也可以对模型行为进行细粒度控制，并且可能带来严重的安全风险。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code

Motivation: 本文的动机是指出多项选择题评估存在局限性，而生成式评估更有效，但之前没有可行的替代方案。

Method: 本文的方法是通过答案匹配进行生成式评估，即给候选模型问题而不提供选项，让其生成自由形式的回答，然后使用现代语言模型和参考答案来判断回答是否匹配。

Result: 本文的结果显示，使用最近的模型（甚至小型模型）进行答案匹配可以达到接近人工标注者之间的一致性，而多项选择评估和使用LLM作为裁判而不提供参考答案与人工评分的对齐度较差。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，通过答案匹配进行生成式评估可以显著提高语言模型评估的有效性，并且建议将评估生态系统从多项选择转移到答案匹配。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

*Zongpu Zhang,Pranab Dash,Y. Charlie Hu,Qiang Xu,Jian Li,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: This paper measures the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM framework on mobile phones and identifies the inefficiency caused by the independent operation of mobile governors. It proposes FUSE, a unified energy-aware governor that improves the energy efficiency of LLM inference on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. Current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU, and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate independently and are oblivious of each other.

Method: We conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency in LLM inference. Based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on mobile devices.

Result: FUSE reduces the time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM models.

Conclusion: FUSE reduces the time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

*Yongsen Zheng,Zongxuan Xie,Guohua Wang,Ziyao Liu,Liang Lin,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架HyFairCRS，旨在解决对话推荐系统中的不公平问题，通过对比学习捕捉用户的多兴趣，并在动态反馈循环中确保公平的物品预测。实验结果表明，该方法在两个数据集上取得了最先进的性能，并有效缓解了不公平现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中的不公平问题，特别是在动态和交互式的对话推荐系统中，因为不公平现象会随着时间的推移而加剧，导致如马太效应、过滤气泡和回音室等严重问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架，称为Hypergraph Contrastive Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS)，通过对比学习建立多样化的超图来捕捉用户广泛的兴趣，并在对话中生成信息性响应，确保在动态用户-系统反馈循环中的公平物品预测。

Result: HyFairCRS在两个基于CRS的数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，同时有效缓解了不公平现象。

Conclusion: HyFairCRS在两个基于CRS的数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，同时有效缓解了不公平现象。

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA是一个自我进化的AI代理，通过不断进化的模板库和动态工具海洋来自主提升能力，实现了在生物医学基准测试中的卓越表现，并且随着经验的积累而持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于生物医学数据、工具和文献的快速增长，研究环境变得碎片化，超出了人类专家的能力。虽然AI代理提供了解决方案，但它们通常依赖于静态的手动策划工具集，限制了它们适应和扩展的能力。

Method: STELLA采用多代理架构，通过两个核心机制自主提升自身能力：一个不断进化的模板库用于推理策略，以及一个动态的工具海洋，随着工具创建代理自动发现和集成新的生物信息学工具而扩展。

Result: STELLA在一系列生物医学基准测试中达到了最先进的准确性，例如在Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine上得分为约26%，在LAB-Bench: DBQA上得分为54%，在LAB-Bench: LitQA上得分为63%，比领先的模型高出多达6个百分点。更重要的是，其性能随着经验的积累而系统性地提高；例如，在Humanity's Last Exam基准测试中，其准确性随着试验次数的增加而几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: STELLA代表了在能够学习和成长的AI代理系统方面的重要进展，可以动态扩展其专业知识，加速生物医学发现的步伐。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在迭代囚徒困境中的表现，发现它们具有高度的竞争性，并展现出独特的战略特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否是一种新的战略智能形式，能够在竞争环境中推理目标。

Method: 本文进行了首次进化IPD锦标赛，将经典的策略（如以牙还牙、严厉惩罚）与来自领先AI公司的代理进行比较。通过改变每个锦标赛中的终止概率（即“未来的阴影”），引入了复杂性和偶然性。

Result: LLMs表现出高度的竞争性，通常能够生存甚至在这些复杂生态系统中繁衍。Google的Gemini模型表现出战略上的冷酷，利用合作对手并报复背叛者；OpenAI的模型保持高度合作，这在敌对环境中证明是灾难性的；Anthropic的Claude则表现出最宽容的互惠行为，显示出恢复合作的显著意愿。

Conclusion: 本文将经典博弈论与机器心理学联系起来，提供了算法在不确定性下的决策制定的丰富而细致的视角。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

TL;DR: HiRA是一个分层框架，将战略规划与专门执行分离，从而提高复杂信息检索任务的答案质量和系统效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）管道难以有效应对现实世界搜索场景中的复杂信息需求，而基于推理的方法由于使用单一模型处理高层规划和详细执行，导致推理效率低下且可扩展性有限。

Method: HiRA是一个分层框架，将战略规划与专门执行分离。该方法将复杂搜索任务分解为聚焦的子任务，将每个子任务分配给配备外部工具和推理能力的领域特定代理，并通过结构化集成机制协调结果。

Result: 实验表明，HiRA在答案质量和系统效率方面都有所提高，证明了其在多步骤信息检索任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: HiRA在四个复杂的跨模态深度搜索基准测试中显著优于最先进的RAG和基于代理的系统，证明了解耦规划和执行在多步骤信息检索任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: StepHint is a new RLVR algorithm that uses multi-level hints to improve the exploration and reasoning abilities of LLMs, addressing the issues of near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of the near-miss reward problem and exploration stagnation in current RLVR methods.

Method: StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the solution space more effectively. It generates valid reasoning chains from stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using an adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints, and multiple-level hints are provided to the model.

Result: StepHint mitigates the near-miss reward problem, improves training efficiency, and helps the model develop better reasoning abilities, enabling it to move beyond its 'comfort zone'.

Conclusion: StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于文本蕴含和上下文学习的方法，用于自动生成法律文本的规范表示，该表示可以编码并作为Python代码执行。这种方法减少了对大型手动标记数据集的需求，并提高了对新立法的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件系统必须遵守法律法规，这是一个资源密集型任务，特别是对于缺乏专门法律专业知识的小组织和初创公司来说。从法规中提取元数据以获取软件的法律要求是确保合规性的关键步骤，但这个过程由于法律文本的长度和复杂性而变得繁琐。

Method: 我们引入了一种基于文本蕴含和上下文学习的方法，用于自动生成法律文本的规范表示，该表示可以编码并作为Python代码执行。

Result: 我们的方法在13个美国州数据泄露通知法上进行了评估，证明了生成的表示能够通过大约89.4%的测试用例，并实现了82.2的精度和88.7的召回率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在13个美国州数据泄露通知法上进行了评估，证明了生成的表示能够通过大约89.4%的测试用例，并实现了82.2的精度和88.7的召回率。

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

Motivation: 有效的访谈需要有技能的访谈者实时制定适当的问题，但面临诸如缺乏领域知识、认知负荷过重和信息过载等挑战。大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，因此我们研究了其在生成后续访谈问题中的应用。

Method: 我们构建了一个基于常见访谈者错误类型的框架，并利用GPT-4o生成后续访谈问题。此外，我们描述了根据访谈者话语生成问题的方法。

Result: 在两个受控实验中，LLM生成的问题在清晰度、相关性和信息量方面不亚于人工编写的问题，而在指导常见错误类型时表现更优。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，LLM生成的问题在清晰度、相关性和信息量方面不亚于人工编写的问题，而且在指导常见错误类型时表现更优。这突显了使用LLM帮助访谈者实时提高需求获取访谈质量和便利性的潜力。

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DeSTA2.5-Audio，这是一个通用的大规模音频语言模型（LALM），旨在实现稳健的听觉感知和指令遵循，而无需任务特定的音频指令微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LALM通常通过在大规模手动策划或LLM合成的音频指令数据集上进行训练来增强LLM的听觉能力，但这些方法常常导致LLM原始语言能力的灾难性遗忘。

Method: 我们重新审视了数据构建流程，提出了DeSTA，这是一种自我生成的跨模态对齐策略，其中主干LLM生成自己的训练目标。

Result: DeSTA2.5-Audio在广泛的音频-语言基准测试中达到了最先进的或有竞争力的性能，包括Dynamic-SUPERB、MMAU、SAKURA、Speech-IFEval和VoiceBench。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了在LALM开发中精心设计数据构建的重要性，并为构建稳健、通用的LALM提供了实用见解。

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于思维链推理的事件流场景文本识别框架ESTR-CoT，通过使用视觉编码器和大语言模型进行对齐，并结合监督微调优化框架。同时，还构建了一个大规模的CoT数据集用于训练，实验结果验证了框架的有效性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作要么采用端到端编码器-解码器框架，要么采用大语言模型进行增强识别，但它们仍然受到解释性不足和弱上下文逻辑推理的限制。

Method: 我们提出了一个基于思维链推理的事件流场景文本识别框架ESTR-CoT。首先采用视觉编码器EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14)将输入事件流转换为标记，并利用Llama分词器对给定的生成提示进行编码。使用Q-former将视觉标记与预训练的大语言模型Vicuna-7B对齐，并同时输出答案和思维链（CoT）推理过程。

Result: 我们的框架可以通过监督微调以端到端的方式进行优化。此外，我们还提出了一种大规模的CoT数据集，通过三阶段处理（即生成、润色和专家验证）来训练我们的框架。该数据集为后续基于推理的大模型的发展提供了坚实的数据基础。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在三个事件流STR基准数据集上得到了充分验证，证明了其有效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

Motivation: 探索图形摘要在科学传播中的潜力，同时解决设计有效图形摘要所需的高级可视化技能问题。

Method: 引入了SciGA-145k数据集，定义了两个任务：Intra-GA推荐和Inter-GA推荐，并提出了CAR作为新的推荐指标。

Result: 提供了这两个任务的基线模型，并通过CAR指标展示了模型行为的细粒度分析。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k为推进视觉科学传播和AI for Science的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

*Ziqi Miao,Yi Ding,Lijun Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VisCo攻击，通过视觉聚焦策略和动态生成辅助图像，构建视觉中心的越狱场景，有效提升了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法中，视觉模态主要作为触发不安全行为的触发器，存在语义模糊性和缺乏现实场景的支撑。因此，需要一种新的设置来构建更真实和有效的越狱场景。

Method: VisCo通过四种不同的视觉聚焦策略生成上下文对话，并在必要时动态生成辅助图像以构建视觉中心的越狱场景。它还结合了自动毒性混淆和语义优化来生成最终的攻击提示。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上实现了4.78的毒性得分和85%的攻击成功率，显著优于基线方法（2.48的毒性得分和22.2%的攻击成功率）。

Conclusion: VisCo攻击在MM-SafetyBench上表现出色，显著优于基线方法，展示了其在构建视觉中心的越狱场景中的有效性。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The
code is available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Visco-Attack.

*Muhammad Bilal Zafar*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a highly accurate and interpretable model for classifying AI-related content in financial texts, offering practical solutions for analysts and regulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches for detecting AI-related disclosures in financial texts lack granularity, interpretability, and robustness.

Method: FinAI-BERT is a domain-adapted transformer-based language model fine-tuned on a manually curated dataset of 1,586 sentences from annual reports of U.S. banks.

Result: FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993) and demonstrated stability across various conditions.

Conclusion: FinAI-BERT provides a scalable, transparent solution for monitoring AI disclosures in financial institutions.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音身份的多面性，建模语音身份具有挑战性。现有的ASV嵌入主要关注静态特征，而忽略了动态元素，如节奏。

Method: 本文研究了ASV嵌入中捕捉的声音特征，并提出了U3D度量标准来评估动态节奏模式。

Result: 本文发现ASV嵌入主要关注静态特征，如音色和音高范围，而忽略了动态元素，如节奏。同时，本文提出了U3D度量标准来评估动态节奏模式。

Conclusion: 本文贡献了评估说话人身份一致性的挑战，并提出了U3D度量标准来评估动态节奏模式。

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种差异注意力机制，以提高音频自监督表示学习的性能，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer架构的注意力机制有时会将部分注意力权重分配给不相关的信息，可能会影响模型的判别能力。

Method: 引入了一种差异注意力机制，通过集成双softmax操作和适当调整的差异系数，有效缓解了无效注意力分配的问题。

Result: ASDA模型在音频分类（AS-2M上49.0% mAP，AS20K上41.5% mAP）、关键词识别（SPC-2上98.3%准确率）和环境声音分类（ESC-50上96.1%准确率）等多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ASDA模型在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，这表明其在音频任务中的有效性，并为更广泛的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在通过自然语言处理识别真正的绿色专利，并研究其对企业的财务表现的影响。

Method: 我们从之前文献中被分类为绿色的约1240万项专利开始训练，训练一个简单的神经网络通过与环境技术相关的表达的向量表示来扩展基础词典。

Result: 我们发现“真正”的绿色专利约占之前文献中分类为绿色的专利的20%。此外，“真正”的绿色专利比其他绿色专利少被引用约1%。拥有至少一项“真正”的绿色专利可以提高销售额、市场份额和生产力，而高新颖性的“真正”绿色专利还能带来更高的利润。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了使用文本分析来评估更细致的专利分类的重要性，这对于不同领域的政策制定是有用的。

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文评估了前沿大型语言模型的隐写术能力，发现它们在标准条件下无法隐藏短消息，但在额外条件下可以成功。同时，模型展现出初步的编码推理能力，但难以在覆盖任务中隐蔽地隐藏推理以欺骗监控器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控大型语言模型的输出对于减轻滥用和不一致的风险至关重要。然而，LLM 可能通过隐写术逃避监控，因此需要评估其隐写术能力以更好地了解潜在风险。

Method: 评估前沿大型语言模型的隐写术能力，重点关注两种类型的隐写术：传递编码信息和执行编码推理。

Result: 当前模型在标准条件下无法在输出中编码短消息而不被监控器发现。但如果提供额外的条件，如使用未受监控的草稿板并协调编码方案，则可以成功。此外，模型在简单的状态跟踪问题中表现出基本的编码推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型表现出初步的隐写术能力，尽管这些能力目前可能不足以绕过设计良好的监控系统，但未来可能会发生变化。

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

Motivation: 尽管已有大量关于虚假信息检测的研究，但主要集中在基于文本或图像的方法上，而较少研究多模态特征组合的有效性。因此，本研究旨在探索多模态特征组合在虚假信息检测中的应用。

Method: 本研究采用早期融合方法，结合文本、图像和社会特征进行分类模型构建，并通过对象检测和光学字符识别（OCR）等技术提取额外的社会特征和视觉特征。

Result: 结果表明，结合无监督和有监督机器学习模型的分类性能优于单模态和双模态模型。此外，研究还分析了虚假信息的传播模式。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，结合无监督和有监督机器学习模型可以显著提高分类性能，相比单模态模型提升了15%，相比双模态模型提升了5%。此外，研究还分析了虚假信息的传播模式。

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在招聘中的使用，以确定其在准确性和算法偏见方面的潜在问题，并探索领域特定模型是否能更有效地解决这些问题。

Method: 研究比较了几种最先进的基础LLMs（包括来自OpenAI、Anthropic、Google、Meta和Deepseek的模型）与他们专有的领域特定招聘模型（Match Score）在工作候选人匹配中的表现。评估了每个模型的预测准确性（ROC AUC、Precision-Recall AUC、F1-score）和公平性（截止分析的影响比跨声明性别、种族和交叉子群体）。

Result: 实验结果显示，Match Score在准确性（ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77）上优于通用LLMs，并在人口统计群体中实现了显著更公平的结果。Match Score在种族影响比方面达到了0.957（接近平等），而最佳LLMs则为0.809或更低（分别为0.906 vs 0.773）。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在高风险领域（如招聘）部署AI时，领域特定建模和偏差审计的重要性，并警告不要在没有充分公平保障的情况下依赖现成的LLMs。此外，实证证据表明，在招聘中选择准确性和公平性之间不应存在二分法，设计良好的算法可以同时实现招聘的准确性与结果的公平性。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) that enable predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization. EBTs show improved performance in both discrete and continuous modalities, outperforming existing models on various tasks and suggesting a promising new paradigm for scaling learning and thinking capabilities of models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking, have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific, problem-specific, or require additional supervision/training on top of unsupervised pretraining.

Method: We train Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence.

Result: EBTs scale faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters, FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2 Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance.

Conclusion: EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking capabilities of models.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniDraft is a framework that allows a single draft model to work with any target model, addressing compatibility and latency issues, and achieving significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenges of using a target model incompatible with the draft model and improving latency in online deployment settings. It motivates the 'one drafter for all' paradigm.

Method: OmniDraft introduces an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address cross-vocabulary mismatch and leverages adaptive drafting techniques to improve decoding speed.

Result: OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models, such as Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B, and Llama3-8B, for speculative decoding and provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Conclusion: OmniDraft is a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. It addresses the challenges of cross-vocabulary mismatch and latency improvements, making it suitable for on-device LLM applications.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

TL;DR: ExPO is a framework that generates effective positive samples for reinforcement learning post-training by conditioning on the ground-truth answer, leading to improved learning efficiency and performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock reasoning ability in settings where the model initially struggles, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current output distribution. However, existing methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce positive samples.

Method: Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO) - a simple and modular framework that generates effective positive samples by conditioning on the ground-truth answer.

Result: Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5.

Conclusion: ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.
