*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new annotated dataset for adverse event extraction focusing on elderly patients, showing mixed results with current models excelling at coarse levels but struggling with fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Presenting a manually annotated corpus for AE extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources.

Method: Evaluating multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation.

Result: Transformer-based models perform well on document-level coarse-grained extraction but struggle with fine-grained entity-level tasks, especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented Adverse Events (AEs) and capturing nuanced clinical language.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: We propose Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) to improve the quality of output during constrained decoding at test time for structured NLP tasks. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms previous approaches in closed information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects. However, during constrained decoding at test time, these approaches can lead to low-quality output.

Method: We use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects. During training, the model is not required to be aware of the constraints. However, we overcome the problem of low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time with BoostCD. It combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction.

Result: We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

Conclusion: We introduce Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) which improves the quality of output during constrained decoding at test time. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents CrEst, a weakly supervised framework to assess the credibility of context documents for large language models (LLMs), improving performance by up to 26.86% in accuracy and 3.49% in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for integrating contextual information in LLMs overlook the credibility of context documents, which can propagate unreliable information.

Method: CrEst uses inter-document agreement to estimate credibility automatically, with black-box and white-box integration strategies for LLMs.

Result: CrEst improves accuracy and F1 score across different model architectures and datasets, maintaining robustness under high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: CrEst demonstrates the importance of document credibility in enhancing the reliability of LLMs and provides effective ways to integrate credibility assessment.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDBench is a new dataset introduced for evaluating LLMs on multi-document reasoning tasks. It is generated synthetically, enabling efficient creation of challenging document sets and QA examples. Analysis shows MDBench poses significant challenges for current LLMs and prompting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks to rigorously examine LLM behavior in multi-document reasoning despite the growing importance of this capability.

Method: A novel synthetic generation process using condensed structured seed knowledge modified by LLM-assisted edits to create challenging document sets and QA examples.

Result: MDBench poses significant challenges for popular LLMs and prompting techniques even with short document sets.

Conclusion: The knowledge-guided generation technique allows targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and can adapt quickly to new challenges and future modeling improvements.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1) allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for diabetes prediction using various prompting methods and compares their performance with traditional machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of LLMs for structured numerical data in diabetes prediction is underexplored.

Method: Tested six LLMs using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods and compared them with traditional ML models on the Pima Indian Diabetes Database.

Result: Proprietary LLMs performed better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy. Gemma-2-27B outperformed traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

Conclusion: LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks, but issues like performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning remain.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score. However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: It's possible to create reversible sentence embeddings using a special memory token in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an interesting phenomenon where LLMs can reconstruct original text exactly.

Method: Introducing a special memory token and optimizing its embedding through training on a fixed sequence.

Result: This method works across English and Spanish datasets, sequences up to 240 tokens, and model sizes from 100M to 8B parameters.

Conclusion: LLMs have an interesting capability for memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how NLP techniques can help identify social isolation and loneliness in narratives, finding that certain groups are more prone to chronic social isolation and suggesting ways to improve surveillance and prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the increasing social isolation and loneliness which significantly contribute to suicide rates, even though these factors are not currently recorded in the NVDRS structured variables.

Method: The method involves using topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers to develop high-quality classifiers.

Result: The result shows that the classifiers developed have an average F1 score of .86 and accuracy of .82. The study identified 1,198 cases mentioning chronic social isolation. Certain groups like men, gay individuals, and divorced people had higher odds of being classified as chronically socially isolated.

Conclusion: The study concludes that NLP techniques can effectively identify social isolation and loneliness in law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives, providing valuable data for surveillance and prevention.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over 300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR = 3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001). We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up. Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in the United States.

*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: We propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data.

Method: Propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs.

Result: PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do.

Conclusion: Using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Develops methods for improving the 'unlearning' ability of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for large language models to 'unlearn' specific information for privacy and ethical reasons.

Method: Experiments on how learning-time choices affect unlearning effectiveness, focusing on paraphrased descriptions.

Result: Paraphrased descriptions improve unlearning performance; unlearning individual facts from a text block is difficult.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding impacts post-hoc unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world, the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新的对话话语解析方法，通过Discourse-aware Clarification Module和Contribution-aware Preference Optimization有效解决歧义问题，实验显示显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话话语解析面临挑战，因为对话中的语言特征（如省略和习语）经常引入模糊性，掩盖了预期的话语关系。

Method: 提出了一种新的方法，包括Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) 和 Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO)。DCM 包含两种推理过程：澄清类型推理和话语目标推理；CPO用于减少错误澄清带来的风险和级联错误。

Result: 实验表明所提出的方法能有效解决歧义问题并显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) 和 Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) 方法在STAC和Molweni数据集上有效解决了歧义问题，并显著优于最先进的基线模型。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces CKD-EHR, a framework that uses knowledge distillation to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease risk prediction using Electronic Health Records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of insufficient medical knowledge representation and low efficiency in clinical deployment faced by existing large language models.

Method: The method involves fine-tuning a large language model on medical knowledge-enhanced data, generating soft labels via multi-granularity attention distillation, and transferring the knowledge to a lightweight BERT model.

Result: On the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR shows improved diagnostic accuracy by 9%, F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2 times faster inference speed compared to the baseline model.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates an effective way to optimize resources in clinical settings while enhancing the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study addresses the one-to-many property of open-domain dialogue, introducing a two-stage framework using Multi-Response Generation and Preference-based Selection tasks. It also presents o2mDial, a new dialogue dataset, along with new learning strategies and evaluation metrics to improve response diversity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance response diversity and quality in open-domain dialogues by addressing the one-to-many property.

Method: Decomposing OD generation into Multi-Response Generation and Preference-based Selection tasks; introducing o2mDial, new learning strategies, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Enhanced response diversity and quality while maintaining contextual coherence; improved response quality by up to 90%.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework improves smaller LLMs' performance in open-domain dialogue generation, making their responses more similar to those of larger models.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少token数量以提高推理速度。

Method: 采用基于规则的预分词方法，并创建包含类似语言单元的种子词汇表，使用基于分支熵的选择算法。

Result: 与BPE相比，Thunder-Tok减少了大约10%的token生育率（即减少了10%的token数量），提高了10%的推理速度。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，Thunder-Tok在各种下游任务上保持了性能，证明了其在设计高效分词器方面的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates memory in state-space language models by analyzing primacy and recency effects. It identifies three memory mechanisms and validates them through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information is retained and forgotten over time in state-space language models.

Method: Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture and observing the accuracy profile.

Result: Identified three memory mechanisms: long-term memory supported by persistent encoding, short-term memory governed by delta-modulated recurrence, and dynamic modulation of memory allocation by semantic regularity.

Conclusion: Memory in state-space language models can be understood through primacy and recency effects, with specific mechanisms identified and validated.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

TL;DR: 研究评估了不同大小的LLMs在SDGs文本分类任务中的表现，并发现经过优化的小型模型可以与大型模型媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据规模和复杂性的巨大挑战，追踪联合国提出的17个可持续发展目标（SDGs）的进展很困难。文本分类模型成为这一领域的关键工具，而大型语言模型（LLMs）因其识别复杂的语言模式和语义的能力，在自然语言处理任务中也变得不可或缺。

Method: 分析了各种专有和开源的大型语言模型(LLMs)，并评估了任务适应技术的有效性，包括零样本学习、少量样本学习以及微调。

Result: 小型模型在经过提示工程优化后，在单一标签多类别文本分类任务中的表现与较大模型相似。

Conclusion: 较小的经过优化的模型可以与较大的模型（如OpenAI的GPT）表现相当。

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

*Feng He,Zijun Chen,Xinnian Liang,Tingting Ma,Yunqi Qiu,Shuangzhi Wu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown great cross-domain generalization capabilities. A new framework called ProtoReasoning is proposed to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs by using scalable and verifiable prototypical representations. The experiments show that ProtoReasoning improves performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms supporting the transfer capability of LRMs.

Method: Propose a framework named ProtoReasoning which leverages scalable and verifiable prototypical representations to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs.

Result: ProtoReasoning shows improvements on logical reasoning, planning tasks, general reasoning, and mathematics tasks compared to baseline models. It also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems.

Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval是一种新的评估方法，它首先区分开放式问题，然后使用不同的评估策略对候选答案进行排名。对于事实性问题，采用自适应关键点评分策略；对于非事实性问题，则使用实例感知的列表式排名策略。实验表明，MinosEval与人工注释更一致，并提供更具解释性的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有传统和基于LLM的评价方法在开放式问答任务中的表现存在不足，如无法捕捉语义相似性、缺乏直观可解释性等。此外，现有的方法忽视了事实性和非事实性问题的区别。

Method: 提出了一种名为MinosEval的新评估方法，该方法包含两个主要部分：首先区分开放性问题类型（事实性和非事实性），然后针对不同类型的问法应用不同的评价策略。对于事实性问题，采用自适应的关键点评分策略；对于非事实性问题，则采用实例感知的列表式排名策略。

Result: 在多个开放性问答数据集上的实验表明，MinosEval与人工标注更为一致，并且能够提供更具解释性的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval解决了现有开放式问答评估方法中存在的关键挑战，即缺乏对事实性和非事实性问题区别的考虑以及评价结果的可解释性问题。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well current language technologies can understand different versions of Basque and Spanish languages. It introduces a new dataset and finds that these technologies perform worse with linguistic variation, especially in Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of existing language technologies in understanding diverse versions of Basque and Spanish languages.

Method: Using Natural Language Inference as a task, introducing a new manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish and their variants, conducting crosslingual and in-context learning experiments with encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models.

Result: There is a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. The decline is not due to lexical overlap but the linguistic variation itself. Encoder-only models struggle more with Western Basque.

Conclusion: Current language technologies face challenges in dealing with linguistic variation, especially in Basque.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: Graph RAG provides a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction, reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B, with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12), effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model (LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence. Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation in large-scale RAG systems.

TL;DR: A new de-identification framework named Thunder-DeID is proposed to meet the legal requirements for public disclosure of court judgments in South Korea.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data protection, the current de-identification process needs improvement due to its inadequacy and vagueness in legal definitions.

Method: Constructing a Korean legal dataset, introducing a PII categorization system, and developing a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The proposed model shows superior performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID is a promising solution to address the challenges in court judgment de-identification.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the de-identification of court judgments.

Result: The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment, including the challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: This survey is the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment, providing valuable insights into the potential and challenges of adopting LLM technologies in clinical research.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

TL;DR: A new method using supervised contrastive learning is proposed to improve language identification performance for low-resource languages on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor performance of low-resource languages in language identification due to class imbalance and bias issues.

Method: Proposes a novel supervised contrastive learning approach to learn domain-invariant representations.

Result: Improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns.

Method: Constructing a dataset of ICU discharge notes with real-world and synthetic versions containing controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic and vital sign attributes, then evaluating five LLMs under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.

Result: Zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models are more stable but less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Demographic factors subtly influence outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing is useful for exposing LLMs' reasoning strategies and improving the safety and transparency of medical AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

TL;DR: This paper presents Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a new fine-tuning method that boosts cross-lingual lexical alignment in low-resource languages like Swahili by leveraging insights from early model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to address the issue of poor performance of large language models in low-resource languages due to data scarcity and underrepresentation.

Method: Introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from an empirically identified optimal early layer.

Result: Significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs and generalizes well to unseen control word pairs.

Conclusion: TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new evaluation framework and method to improve the reliability and interpretability of GUI agents in multimodal large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations in GUI agents caused by systematic localization errors.

Method: Introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) to quantify model uncertainty, and propose Context-Aware Cropping to refine input context.

Result: The proposed methods reveal nuanced failure modes and improve the performance of GUI agents.

Conclusion: The framework and methods enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks face challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, especially with increasing task complexity and number of agents.

Method: AgentGroupChat-V2 includes a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture, an adaptive collaboration engine, and agent organization optimization strategies.

Result: AgentGroupChat-V2 achieved high accuracy rates in experiments, such as 91.50% on GSM8K, 30.4% on AIME, and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval, outperforming other methods significantly.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 offers a comprehensive solution for efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with notable advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents RE-IMAGINE, a framework to evaluate reasoning abilities of large language models across different levels of the ladder of causation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs achieve reasoning through true understanding or statistical recall of training data.

Method: Introduces RE-IMAGINE, which uses problem variations in symbolic representations to test reasoning beyond memorization.

Result: The framework was applied to four benchmarks, revealing reliance on statistical recall in model performance.

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE provides a way to assess reasoning abilities of LLMs and opens avenues for targeted skill development across the reasoning hierarchy.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: Introduces CINGS, a method for improving grounded generation in large language models through post-training supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure large language models generate responses grounded in provided external context rather than relying solely on their internal parameters.

Method: Post-training supervision where the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context.

Result: CINGS improves grounding in textual and visual domains, reduces hallucinations, and maintains factual consistency without harming general downstream performance.

Conclusion: Models trained with CINGS show stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.

TL;DR: Introduce SPARE, a new method for efficient, high-quality automated process annotation to improve multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for improving reasoning capabilities of LLMs is challenging.

Method: Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE)

Result: Improves reasoning performance for fine-tuning models and training reward models. Achieves competitive performance on mathematical datasets with higher efficiency.

Conclusion: SPARE offers an efficient and effective way for process supervision in various domains.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

### [33] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An emotion-guided framework called EmoBi is proposed for detecting hyperbole and metaphor in text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features and ignore the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices.

Method: The proposed framework includes three modules: emotion analysis module, emotion-based domain mapping module, and bidirectional dynamic interaction module.

Result: Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.

Conclusion: Our approach has the potential to advance hyperbole and metaphor detection.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how reinforcement learning and internal reasoning can improve grounding in large language models, using the GRPO method to train models across four datasets, showing significant improvements in answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses is challenging for large language models, especially in straightforward scenarios where instruction-tuned models often fail.

Method: The study uses the GRPO method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven reinforcement learning for building more verifiable and reliable large language models.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RATTENTION, a new method that improves the efficiency of local-global attention models by integrating a linear attention mechanism to capture out-of-window token information. Pretraining experiments show that RATTENTION achieves better performance-efficiency tradeoffs than previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of local attention which ignores tokens outside the defined window and improve the efficiency of local-global attention models in short-context scenarios.

Method: Integrating a specialized linear attention mechanism with local attention to capture information from out-of-window tokens.

Result: RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency, matching the performance of full-attention models with a small window size of 512. It also enhances long-context performance and maintains training efficiency.

Conclusion: RATTENTION shifts the Pareto frontier of local-global attention models, enabling efficiency gains even in short contexts without compromising performance or training efficiency.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes methods to approximate training data from model weights, showing promising results in recovering useful data and improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of data approximation from model weights.

Method: A gradient-based approach that selects matching data from a large public text corpus.

Result: On AG News classification task, performance improved from 65% to 80%. When applied to a model trained with SFT on MSMARCO web documents, perplexity reduced from 3.3 to 2.3.

Conclusion: Our method effectively recovers useful data from model weights, improving performance significantly even without access to the true training data.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task, our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%, approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3, compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) often cause noticeable latency in real-time voice chat applications. A novel framework called Predictive Generation (PredGen) is proposed to reduce this latency by generating candidate responses while the user is still speaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve user experience by reducing latency in real-time voice chat applications using LLMs.

Method: Propose a novel framework called Predictive Generation (PredGen) that uses speculative decoding to generate candidate responses during user input.

Result: Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, with minimal additional computation cost.

Conclusion: The proposed Predictive Generation (PredGen) framework can significantly reduce latency in real-time voice chat applications using LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

TL;DR: Evaluate gender fairness in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies mainly focused on binary gender distinctions. This paper introduces a new metric to assess inclusivity for all genders.

Method: Introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI) which evaluates models with respect to gender pronouns and generation behaviors.

Result: Significant differences in inclusivity were found among 22 LLMs.

Conclusion: Improving inclusivity in LLMs is crucial and this work provides a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Motivation: To create a benchmark that can assess foundation models' ability to verify claims in a multimodal scientific context.

Method: The paper uses a dataset of 3,000 expert-annotated examples from 1,113 scientific papers with four subsets representing different reasoning types.

Result: The models tested show a significant performance gap compared to human experts. RAG is analyzed, and limitations of current open-source models are identified.

Conclusion: SciVer highlights the need for improvement in foundation models' comprehension and reasoning capabilities in multimodal scientific literature tasks.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over 1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal scientific literature tasks.

*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new task called Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG) is introduced, along with a dataset named DiscoSG-DS containing 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs. A method called DiscoSG-Refiner is proposed to improve SPICE scores by 30% over the best baseline while being significantly faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often miss phenomena like cross-sentence coreference when generating discourse-level visual descriptions, leading to fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance.

Method: Introduce DiscoSG-Refiner that drafts a base graph using one small PLM and refines it with another PLM to propose graph edits iteratively.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by 30% over the best baseline and achieves 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also enhances downstream VLM tasks such as discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Conclusion: The introduction of DiscoSG and DiscoSG-Refiner addresses limitations of current methods in generating discourse-level visual descriptions, improving both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

Motivation: 现有文档理解（DU）方法在处理复杂布局、表格和图表时存在困难。尽管视觉语言大型模型（VLLMs）在多种任务上有所改进，但它们在处理长上下文视觉输入方面的有效性尚不清楚。WikiMixQA旨在通过复杂的多模态推理问题来评估这些模型。

Method: 开发了一个名为WikiMixQA的新基准，包括1000个MCQs，涉及从4000个维基百科页面提取的表格和图表。该基准测试要求模型综合来自多个模态的信息。

Result: 在对12种最先进的视觉语言模型进行评估后发现，当提供直接上下文时，专有模型的准确率约为70%，但在需要从长文档中检索时，性能显著下降。GPT-4-o是唯一在检索条件下超过50%准确率的模型，而开源模型的表现最差，最高准确率为27%。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了长上下文多模态推理的挑战，并证明了WikiMixQA作为推进文档理解研究的关键基准的重要性。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of generative AI models to create multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Portuguese for reading comprehension tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual creation of MCQs is time-consuming and costly. Generative AI provides a potential solution, but there is limited research on the quality and reliability of generated MCQs, especially in non-English languages.

Method: Generative models were used to produce MCQs that aligned with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and different difficulty levels. The MCQs were evaluated through expert review and analysis of psychometric properties from student responses.

Result: Current models can generate MCQs of similar quality to human-authored ones, but issues related to semantic clarity and answerability persist. Challenges remain in designing high-quality distractors.

Conclusion: Generative AI holds promise for automating MCQ generation, but further research is needed to address the identified issues.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance model reliability and understand how cognition is coded in neural networks by studying the regret mechanism in large language models.

Method: Proposes a workflow for constructing a regret dataset, S-CDI metric for identifying optimal regret representation layers, and RDS metric for identifying regret neurons along with GIC for analyzing activation patterns.

Result: Successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer, revealed an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, and categorized neurons into three functional groups.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into the regret mechanism in large language models, offering tools to improve model reliability and understanding of cognitive coding in neural networks.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Method: 通过三个实验来研究英式和美式英语使用者对强度词的理解，并开发了一个计算认知模型来递归推理说话者如何平衡信息性、礼貌和表达成本。

Result: 研究发现，跨文化交流中对强度词理解的差异来源于（1）不同的字面意义；（2）对表达成本的不同权重。

Conclusion: 跨文化交流中的理解差异并非单纯由语义变化或礼貌规范引起，而是来自这两者之间复杂的相互作用。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper, we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity, politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities of large language models in generative commonsense reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposing Ordered CommonGen as a new benchmark that measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order.

Result: Found that LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions but often exhibit biases towards specific concept order patterns leading to low-diversity outputs. The best-performing LLM achieved only 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: There is a need for further improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight, interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource, constrained or under-studied language settings.

TL;DR: Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn) is a reinforcement learning framework that improves large language models' reasoning reliability by training them on similar question cohorts derived from shared abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the consistency and robustness of large language models' reasoning.

Method: Introduce CC-Learn, which uses a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, retrieval bonus, and rejection penalty, optimized through reinforcement learning instead of supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA show improved accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning effectively enhances reasoning consistency in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

### [48] [Leaky Thoughts: Large Reasoning Models Are Not Private Thinkers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15674)
*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how large reasoning models used as personal agents can unintentionally leak sensitive user data through their reasoning traces, despite these being assumed to be internal and safe. It shows that increasing the models' reasoning steps can make this leakage worse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the potential for privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents.

Method: The authors use prompt injections and agentic evaluations to demonstrate the extent of privacy leakage in reasoning traces.

Result: Test-time compute approaches, especially those with more reasoning steps, increase privacy leakage. Although these approaches make the model's final answers more cautious, they also lead to more verbose reasoning and greater leakage in the model's internal thinking.

Conclusion: Safety measures should not only focus on the outputs of the models but also extend to their internal reasoning processes.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates how well 21 machine translation systems handle gender ambiguity, finding that most do not maintain gender neutrality. It identifies some strategies used by a few systems to achieve gender-neutral translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent misgendering and representational harms in machine translation.

Method: Assessing sensitivity to gender neutrality across 21 MT systems in three translation directions.

Result: Most MT systems fail to maintain gender neutrality when faced with gender ambiguity.

Conclusion: There is a lack of effective gender-neutral translations in current MT systems, but some systems employ specific strategies to address this issue.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English, maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific strategies, depending on the target language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GenRecal is a new method for distilling knowledge from large vision-language models to smaller ones, improving their performance and making them more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large vision-language models in real-world scenarios is difficult due to their high computational demands. There is a need to distill knowledge from large models to smaller ones, but this is challenging due to the diversity in VLM architectures.

Method: GenRecal, a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs, includes a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between different VLMs.

Result: GenRecal improves baseline performances significantly and outperforms large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs on multiple challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal provides an effective solution for knowledge distillation across different types of VLMs, making it possible to deploy more efficient models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

*Yuhui Shi,Yehan Yang,Qiang Sheng,Hao Mi,Beizhe Hu,Chaoxi Xu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method called PhantomHunter is proposed to detect text generated by privately-tuned large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of large language models has led to more severe societal issues, and existing detection methods perform poorly on text from privately-tuned models.

Method: PhantomHunter uses a family-aware learning framework to capture shared traits across model families.

Result: PhantomHunter outperforms seven baselines and three industrial services with F1 scores over 96% on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter is a promising solution for detecting text generated by unseen, privately-tuned large language models.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于LLM的代理计划缓存方法，该方法通过提取、存储、适配和重用结构化计划模板来减少服务成本。实验表明，该系统可以平均降低46.62%的成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM缓存技术不足以满足依赖外部数据或环境上下文的代理应用程序的需求。

Method: 提出了代理计划缓存的方法，该方法在测试时从已完成的代理执行中提取计划模板，使用关键词提取匹配新请求与缓存计划，并利用轻量级模型将这些模板适配为特定任务的计划。

Result: 在多个现实世界的代理应用程序上的评估显示，该系统可以平均减少46.62%的成本，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的代理计划缓存提供了一种更有效的解决方案来服务于基于LLM的代理，可以补充现有的LLM服务基础设施。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are either focused on retrieving and reasoning over digital information or interacting with the physical world, limiting their ability to handle tasks requiring integrated physical and digital intelligence.

Method: Developing the Embodied Web Agents task environments and constructing the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark to evaluate cross-domain intelligence.

Result: Significant performance gaps were found between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities when evaluating cross-domain intelligence.

Conclusion: This paper introduces Embodied Web Agents, a new approach that combines physical and digital intelligence, highlighting significant performance gaps between AI systems and humans.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

TL;DR: ETS uses EEG and eye-tracking data to improve open-vocabulary text generation and sentiment classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to decode natural language from brain activity using non-invasive EEG, especially for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods struggle with noise and variability.

Method: ETS, a framework that integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data.

Result: Superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification.

Conclusion: ETS significantly outperforms supervised baselines and has great potential for high performance open vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1) open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Develop a method called Assembly-of-Experts (AoE) to create efficient child models from existing Mixture-of-Experts models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) requires significant computational resources. Creating child models from existing parent models can save costs.

Method: Interpolate individual weight tensors of parent models to create child models.

Result: Nearly every generated AoE child model is functional and capable. A child model called Chimera combines two parent models and performs well without fine-tuning or distillation.

Conclusion: The AoE method allows for efficient creation of capable child models from existing parent models.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed. Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Conclusion: Guru项目及其衍生模型展示了强化学习在提升大型语言模型推理能力方面的潜力，尤其是在较少出现在预训练数据中的复杂任务上。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

### [57] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics of large language models, revealing that as vocabulary size increases, training dynamics interpolate between the μP regime and the Large Vocab (LV) Regime. It also suggests an optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio for the LV regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the pretraining process of large language models more efficient, especially focusing on the limitations of μP in handling varying vocabulary sizes.

Method: Theoretical analysis and experimental validation including pretraining a 1B model from scratch.

Result: Identified a new Large Vocab (LV) Regime with optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio scaling as Θ(√width), different from μP's Θ(width).

Conclusion: This work contributes to better understanding of training dynamics in large language models with varying vocabulary sizes and provides practical scaling rules for embedding learning rates.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $μP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $μ$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $μ$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \emph{interpolate between the $μ$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $μ$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $Θ(\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $Θ(width)$ ratio predicted by $μ$P. We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR.

Conclusion: 多层或循环变压器可以有效利用未标记的数据，并且通过理论研究提出了一种通过循环脱机表格基础模型来增强其半监督能力的方法。在现实世界的数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法显著提高了表格数据的半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PRISM, a new method for describing neural network features that can handle polysemantic features, which outperforms previous methods by providing more accurate and faithful descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature description methods have limited robustness and assume that each neuron encodes only a single concept, despite evidence showing that neurons are often polysemantic.

Method: The authors developed PRISM, a novel framework that captures the complexity of neural network features and provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features.

Result: PRISM was applied to language models and benchmarked against existing methods, demonstrating improved accuracy and faithfulness in feature descriptions.

Conclusion: PRISM offers a more effective way to describe neural network features, especially those with multiple meanings, enhancing the interpretability of model behavior.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的训练自由方法LoX，通过外推对齐LLM的安全子空间来增强安全鲁棒性。实验结果表明，LoX在面对良性或恶意微调攻击时显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了模型适应新任务的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule is an automated system for deriving rule-based rewards from preference feedback, enhancing reinforcement learning models' performance across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF methods depend heavily on manual rule creation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. AutoRule aims to automate this process to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: The approach involves three stages: interpreting user preferences via a reasoning model, identifying potential rules from interpretation chains, and synthesizing these into a cohesive rule set. These rules are then used as auxiliary rewards during policy optimization.

Result: AutoRule shows significant improvements in performance metrics like win rates and second-turn accuracy on specific tasks, outperforming baselines without rule-based rewards.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the efficacy of AutoRule in automating rule extraction for RLHF, leading to better performance and reduced reward hacking tendencies.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

### [62] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can generate dense latents which are meaningful model representations rather than training artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents in SAEs.

Method: Systematic investigation including demonstrating the properties of dense latents, introducing a taxonomy of dense latents, and analyzing their evolution across layers.

Result: Dense latents form antipodal pairs, reflect meaningful model representations, and can be categorized into several classes like position tracking and entropy regulation. They shift from structural to semantic features and finally to output-oriented signals across layers.

Conclusion: Dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be ignored.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在社会科学研究中模拟人类行为的能力，特别是在多个选择调查中的表现。

Method: 使用假设检验提出一个定量框架来评估LLMs与实际人类行为之间的不一致。

Result: 发现一个流行的LLM在模拟特定子人群（如不同种族、年龄和收入群体）对争议性问题的意见时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 强调了在社会科学研究中使用LLMs时需要新的实践，而不仅仅是简单地模拟人类主体。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing, we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings. This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects.

### [64] [Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15041)
*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This study examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o in extracting economic narratives from texts compared to traditional pipelines using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. It evaluates GPT-4o's performance against expert-produced narratives on Wall Street Journal and New York Times articles about inflation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can serve as an alternative to complex model pipelines for extracting meaningful economic narratives.

Method: Analyzing a corpus of newspaper articles related to inflation using GPT-4o and comparing its outputs with gold-standard narratives created by expert annotators.

Result: GPT-4o successfully extracts valid economic narratives but does not reach the level of expert annotators especially with complex narratives.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in economic narrative extraction but require further development to match expert levels; they offer new opportunities for research in economics and social sciences.

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts. Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs to pursue similar objectives.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an OCR-based speech synthesis system developed using LabVIEW for better access to books for visually impaired individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide visually impaired individuals with better access to books beyond Braille and audio recordings.

Method: Development of an OCR-based speech synthesis system using LabVIEW.

Result: An accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly system was created.

Conclusion: The proposed system could significantly improve access to books for visually impaired people.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition (OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

TL;DR: This paper presents SonicVerse, a multi-task music captioning model that integrates music feature detection tasks to generate detailed captions for music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enrich music databases and advance research in music AI with accurate and detailed music captions.

Method: A projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens and detects music features through auxiliary heads.

Result: The model produces rich, descriptive captions for both short and longer music pieces.

Conclusion: The proposed SonicVerse model effectively generates detailed music captions by integrating multiple music feature detection tasks.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Result: SemIRNet achieves an accuracy of 88.87% and an F1 value of 86.33%, surpassing existing optimal methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet) outperforms existing methods on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark dataset, improving accuracy and F1 value by 1.64% and 2.88% respectively.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples. Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64% and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model performance.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However, challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function, enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46, highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) named video-SALMONN 2 has been presented, which uses low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for enhanced video captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). New metrics were proposed to evaluate video descriptions, and a multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach was introduced to improve training. This resulted in a significant reduction in captioning error rates and superior performance in video captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is crucial for video understanding.

Method: The method involves creating an advanced audio-visual LLM with LoRA for video captioning using DPO. It also introduces new metrics for evaluation and a MrDPO approach for training improvement.

Result: The MrDPO approach significantly improved video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing error rates by 28%. The model outperformed larger models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks.

Conclusion: Video-SALMONN 2, with only 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models in video captioning tasks and maintains competitive performance on video question-answering benchmarks.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

### [70] [Detecting Narrative Shifts through Persistent Structures: A Topological Analysis of Media Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14836)
*Mark M. Bailey,Mark I. Heiligman*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study uses a mathematical technique called persistent homology to analyze how major events change the way people talk about them in the news.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find a way to automatically detect when big events cause significant changes in public discourse.

Method: Uses persistent homology to create diagrams from news articles about events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the murder of George Floyd. Measures disruptions and changes using Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies.

Result: Major events cause noticeable changes in the structure of news narratives. Changes in basic structure often happen before more complex changes.

Conclusion: Persistent homology provides a new method for detecting shifts in public attention without needing to know about specific events ahead of time.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.

TL;DR: A unified neural speech codec named Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC) is proposed, which uses knowledge distillation to factorize its bottleneck into three linguistic levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified neural speech codec that can disentangle linguistic information at different levels.

Method: Factorizing the bottleneck into acoustic, phonetic, and lexical levels using knowledge distillation from a pre-trained speech encoder and a text-based encoder.

Result: Experiments show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets, preserving naturalness and providing interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in disentanglement and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: HAC has the potential to serve as a unified discrete speech representation bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues. Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.
