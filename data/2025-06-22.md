### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event extraction from elderly patient discharge summaries, which includes unique annotation features and evaluates various models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clinical NLP resources for elderly patients and to tackle challenges in AE extraction such as rare events and complex attributes.

Method: Manually annotate a corpus with 14 clinically significant AEs and evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities.

Result: Transformer-based models perform well on document-level coarse-grained extraction but poorly on fine-grained entity-level tasks, especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent methods in structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model to map input text to structured output, relying on constrained decoding. However, this leads to low-quality output at test time. BoostCD improves this by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of output during constrained decoding in structured NLP tasks.

Method: BoostCD combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model twice to obtain two weak predictions, and Phase 2 uses a learned autoregressive boosted model to combine these predictions.

Result: BoostCD outperforms previous approaches in closed information extraction both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors.

Conclusion: BoostCD enhances the performance of structured NLP tasks by improving the quality of output during constrained decoding.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method called CrEst is introduced to assess the credibility of context documents for large language models (LLMs) during inference, improving accuracy and F1 scores by up to 26.86% and 3.49%, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of varying credibility of context documents which may lead to unreliable information propagation in LLMs.

Method: A weakly supervised framework based on inter-document agreement to estimate credibility automatically, with two integration strategies for different model types.

Result: CrEst improves performance across three model architectures and five datasets, showing robustness under high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed CrEst framework effectively enhances the credibility assessment of context documents for LLMs, leading to better performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on multi-document reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in multi-document reasoning tasks.

Method: A novel synthetic generation process using condensed structured seed knowledge and LLM-assisted edits to generate challenging document sets and QA examples.

Result: MDBench poses significant challenges for popular LLMs and prompting techniques, even with short document sets.

Conclusion: The knowledge-guided generation technique allows targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and can adapt quickly to new challenges and future modeling improvements.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型在糖尿病预测中的应用，发现专有模型如GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B在少量提示设置下表现出色，尽管存在性能波动和需要进一步优化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）模型已被广泛用于糖尿病预测，但LLMs在结构化数值数据上的应用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 本研究测试了零样本、一样本和三样本提示方法的有效性。使用Pima印度糖尿病数据库（PIDD）进行了实证分析。评估了六个LLMs，包括四个开源模型：Gemma-2-27B、Mistral-7B、Llama-3.1-8B、Llama-3.2-2B，以及两个专有模型：GPT-4o和Gemini Flash 2.0。同时，将其性能与三种传统机器学习模型（随机森林、逻辑回归和支持向量机）进行了比较。

Result: 专有LLMs的表现优于开源模型，GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B在少量提示设置下获得了最高的准确性。Gemma-2-27B在F1分数上也超过了传统的机器学习模型。然而，还存在一些问题，如不同提示策略下的性能变化以及需要领域特定的微调。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在糖尿病预测任务中表现出了潜力，尤其是专有模型如GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B，在少量提示设置下取得了最高的准确率。Gemma-2-27B还在F1分数上超过了传统的机器学习模型。这项研究表明，LLMs可以用于医疗预测任务，并鼓励未来在提示工程和混合方法上的研究以改进健康护理预测。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: It is possible to generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an interesting phenomenon about LLMs' capabilities.

Method: Introduce a special memory token and optimize its embedding through training on a fixed sequence.

Result: Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters.

Conclusion: LLMs have an interesting capability which suggests potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses NLP techniques to identify social isolation and loneliness in NVDRS narratives, developing high-quality classifiers that reveal men, gay individuals, and divorced people have higher odds of chronic social isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rising issue of social isolation and loneliness contributing to suicide rates by developing tools to better identify these issues in narrative data.

Method: Using topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers to analyze law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives.

Result: Classifiers with an average F1 score of .86 and accuracy of .82 identified 1,198 cases mentioning chronic social isolation, with significant predictors including gender, sexual orientation, and marital status.

Conclusion: The methods developed can enhance surveillance and prevention strategies for social isolation and loneliness in the US.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce PrefBERT for evaluating open-ended long-form generation and improving its training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem.

Method: Proposing PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs.

Result: PrefBERT remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs.

Conclusion: PrefBERT can offer better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of learning-time knowledge encoding on the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge in large language models. It finds that using paraphrased descriptions during learning improves unlearning performance and that unlearning individual knowledge from a text block is difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of large language models in the real world necessitates the ability to 'unlearn' specific knowledge for privacy and ethical reasons.

Method: Empirical investigation into the impact of learning-time knowledge encoding on unlearning factual knowledge.

Result: Learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and unlearning individual knowledge from a text block is challenging.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding may be crucial for enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法来提高对话话语解析器的性能，通过引入Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM)和Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO)，在STAC和Molweni数据集上取得了比现有技术更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话话语解析旨在识别和分析对话中语句之间的语篇关系。然而，对话中的语言特征（如省略和习语）经常引入模糊性，掩盖预期的语篇关系，对解析器构成重大挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM)的方法来增强对话话语解析器的性能。DCM采用两种不同的推理过程：澄清类型推理和话语目标推理。此外，我们引入了Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO)，以减轻错误澄清的风险，从而减少级联错误。

Result: 我们的方法在STAC和Molweni数据集上的广泛实验表明，它能够有效解决歧义问题，并显著优于最先进的（SOTA）基线。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在STAC和Molweni数据集上的广泛实验表明，它能够有效解决歧义问题，并显著优于最先进的（SOTA）基线。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CKD-EHR的新框架，通过知识蒸馏技术改进了基于电子健康记录（EHR）的疾病预测模型，显著提升了诊断准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在医学知识表示不足和临床部署效率低下的挑战下，研究者提出CKD-EHR框架以解决这些问题。

Method: 首先对大型语言模型Qwen2.5-7B在增强医疗知识的数据上进行微调作为教师模型；接着通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制生成可解释的软标签；最后将蒸馏的知识转移到轻量级BERT学生模型中。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上的实验结果显示，CKD-EHR的诊断准确性提高了9%，F1分数提高了27%，并且实现了22.2倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR通过知识蒸馏技术实现了高效准确的疾病风险预测，在MIMIC-III数据集上显著优于基线模型，提升了诊断准确性、F1分数，并加快了推理速度。这项创新解决方案不仅极大地提高了资源利用效率，还显著增强了诊断的准确性和及时性，为临床环境中的资源优化提供了实用的技术方法。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage framework to enhance response diversity and quality in open-domain dialogues by modeling the one-to-many property using a specially designed dataset and new training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly model the one-to-many property of open-domain dialogues which leads to limited response diversity.

Method: Decomposing OD generation into Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS). Introducing o2mDial, new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, novel evaluation metrics for MRG, and a model-based approach for PS.

Result: The proposed method improves response quality by up to 90% while maintaining contextual coherence.

Conclusion: Applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs enhances response diversity and quality for open-domain dialogues.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok是一种新的韩语分词器，通过规则预分词和基于分支熵的选择算法，在不损害模型性能的情况下降低分词数量和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分词方法存在效率问题，导致推理速度较慢，需要一种更高效的分词器来提升性能。

Method: 使用基于规则的预分词方法并结合种子词汇表与分支熵选择算法。

Result: 与BPE相比，Thunder-Tok在各种下游任务中减少了约10%的分词数，提升了10%的推理速度。

Conclusion: Thunder-Tok的方法证明了其在设计高效语言模型分词器方面的有效性与实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

### [14] [Emergence of Primacy and Recency Effect in Mamba: A Mechanistic Point of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15156)
*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: State-space language models exhibit memory behaviors characterized by primacy and recency effects. Three mechanisms support memory retention: persistent encoding for long-term memory, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term memory, and dynamic modulation influenced by semantic regularity. These findings were validated across models of different sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how state-space language models retain and forget information over time using primacy and recency effects as tools.

Method: Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture to observe memory patterns and identifying mechanisms through ablations and input perturbations.

Result: A consistent U-shaped accuracy profile was observed, indicating strong performance at sequence ends. Three memory mechanisms were identified: persistent encoding for long-term memory, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term memory, and dynamic modulation by semantic regularity.

Conclusion: Memory in state-space language models is supported by specific mechanisms including persistent encoding, delta-modulated recurrence, and semantic regularity-driven modulation.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

TL;DR: This study evaluates different LLMs and task adaptation techniques for SDG-related text classification tasks, finding that optimized smaller models can perform as well as larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking progress towards the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals is challenging due to the extensive and complex data involved, making automated text classification essential.

Method: Analyzing various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs, evaluating task adaptation techniques such as Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning.

Result: Smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT.

Conclusion: Optimized smaller models can be effective alternatives to larger models for text classification tasks related to the Sustainable Development Goals.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种名为ProtoReasoning的框架来提升LLMs的推理能力，该框架通过利用可扩展且可验证的原型表示（Prolog用于逻辑推理，PDDL用于规划），在逻辑推理、规划任务、一般推理和数学方面表现出比基线模型更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型在跨领域泛化方面的机制支持仍不清楚，因此提出了共享抽象推理原型的假设。

Method: 提出ProtoReasoning框架，包含自动原型构建管道、全面验证系统以及在原型空间内合成问题的可扩展性。

Result: 在逻辑推理、规划任务、一般推理和数学方面表现优于基线模型，并且消融研究证实了在原型空间中学习也表现出增强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 验证了推理原型作为大型语言模型可泛化推理的基础的假设。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

### [17] [MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15215)
*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Propose a new evaluation method named MinosEval for open-ended question answering tasks, which improves alignment with human annotations and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics and current LLM-based evaluation approaches have limitations in capturing semantic similarities and providing intuitive interpretations for open-ended question answering.

Method: MinosEval first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different strategies: adaptive key-point scoring for factoid questions and instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid questions.

Result: Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses the challenges of evaluating open-ended question answering tasks by improving semantic similarity capture and interpretability.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea,Itziar Gonzalez-Dios,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well current language technologies can understand different versions of Basque and Spanish. It introduces a new dataset and finds that larger language models perform worse with linguistic variation, especially in Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of existing language technologies to handle linguistic variations in Basque and Spanish.

Method: Using Natural Language Inference as a task, they created a parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish and their variants. They conducted experiments with encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models.

Result: Performance drops when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Encoder-only models have trouble with Western Basque.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges faced by current language technologies in dealing with linguistic variation.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Graph RAG framework which combines several methods to create a historical character relationship dataset with minimal manual annotation. It also improves the alignment of general models with historical knowledge and shows improved performance in relation extraction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain knowledge gaps in general large language models for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and AIGC technology.

Method: The proposed method involves creating a historical character relationship dataset using chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision. It also introduces a collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: The domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B achieved optimal performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated with GraphRAG improved F1 by 11% on the open-domain C-CLUE relation extraction dataset.

Conclusion: This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Motivation: To develop an effective retrieval-augmented generation system for question answering over large-scale web corpora.

Method: Hybrid retrieval strategy combining sparse and dense indices, K-Means clustering, and cluster-specific prompts for LLMs.

Result: Ranked 2nd in faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset.

Conclusion: Clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation improve the performance of large-scale RAG systems.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new framework named Thunder-DeID is introduced to enhance the de-identification of court judgments in South Korea.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring open access to justice while protecting personal data, addressing the limitations of the current de-identification process, and dealing with vague legal definitions.

Method: Constructing a Korean legal dataset, categorizing PII systematically, and developing a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The developed model shows state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: The proposed Thunder-DeID framework provides a solution that meets the legal requirements while improving the efficiency and effectiveness of de-identifying court judgments.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey examines the task of trial-patient matching and evaluates LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment, identifying challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trial recruitment could benefit from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the adoption of LLMs in this field is limited due to the reliance on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks.

Method: A survey analyzing the task of trial-patient matching and contextualizing emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment.

Result: Existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks were critically examined along with the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Conclusion: This survey is the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

*Negar Foroutan,Jakhongir Saydaliev,Ye Eun Kim,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel supervised contrastive learning approach to improve language identification performance for low-resource languages on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address class imbalance and bias issues in low-resource languages with limited single-domain data.

Method: A novel supervised contrastive learning approach to learn domain-invariant representations.

Result: Improved LID performance by 3.2% on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances LID models for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

*Camila Zurdo Tagliabue,Heloisa Oss Boll,Aykut Erdem,Erkut Erdem,Iacer Calixto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeVisE is a new method for testing large language models' ability to understand clinical data. It uses controlled changes to patient demographics and vital signs to see how these affect the model's decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods can't tell if large language models are really reasoning or just spotting patterns. There's a need for better ways to test these models.

Method: DeVisE creates a dataset of ICU notes with real and synthetic versions that have changed demographic and vital sign details. It then tests five types of large language models to see how they react to these changes.

Result: Zero-shot models showed more consistent reasoning when faced with changes, while fine-tuned models were stable but less sensitive to important changes. Demographic factors had an impact on model outputs.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing like DeVisE helps us understand how clinical LLMs think and can guide the creation of fairer and clearer medical AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

TL;DR: SANSKRITI is a benchmark for evaluating language models' comprehension of India's cultural diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well language models understand local socio-cultural contexts in India.

Method: Create a large dataset of 21,853 question-answer pairs covering 16 aspects of Indian culture across 28 states and 8 union territories.

Result: Most models struggle with culturally nuanced queries, especially in region-specific contexts.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI provides a new standard for assessing and improving cultural understanding in language models.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COSMMIC is a new dataset that supports comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization in Indian languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited research in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for Indian languages.

Method: Integrating reader insights and feedback, exploring summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images.

Result: The study found that incorporating user comments and images improved the quality of summaries. The use of advanced language models like LLama3 and GPT-4 helped assess the dataset's effectiveness.

Conclusion: COSMMIC is a new dataset that bridges gaps in Indian language resources for comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel fine-tuning approach that boosts lexical alignment in low-resource languages for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of poor performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in low-resource languages (LRLs) due to data scarcity and underrepresentation during pre-training.

Method: Introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to target embeddings from an optimal early layer.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement in output-level lexical alignment for both trained and unseen word pairs in Swahili-English language pairs.

Conclusion: TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, providing a parameter-efficient method to improve lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Zhicheng Yang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) allow GUI agents to interact with operating systems via language grounding to spatial actions. However, they often hallucinate, causing systematic localization errors. This paper introduces a new evaluation framework that classifies model predictions into four types and proposes the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) to measure model uncertainty. Additionally, it presents Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free method to improve model performance by refining input context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations in MLLMs which lead to reliability problems when GUI agents interact with operating systems.

Method: 1. Introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework categorizing model predictions into four types. 2. Propose the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) for quantifying model uncertainty. 3. Develop Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique to refine input context.

Result: The proposed framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: This paper contributes to improving the reliability and interpretability of MLLMs used in GUI agents through novel evaluation and refinement techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents RE-IMAGINE, a framework to assess the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by generating problem variations at different levels of the causation hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs' high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks comes from true reasoning or statistical recall of the training set.

Method: Introducing RE-IMAGINE, a framework that uses the ladder of causation to create problem variations that cannot be solved by memorization alone.

Result: The framework was tested on four benchmarks, showing reduced performance on problem variations, indicating some reliance on statistical recall.

Conclusion: The study suggests a need for further research into improving LLMs' reasoning skills across different levels of the causation hierarchy.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) often need external knowledge to provide information or reduce hallucination. This paper introduces CINGS, a post-training method that improves grounding in both textual and visual domains without affecting general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the grounded generation of LLMs by ensuring they rely on external context when needed.

Method: CINGS is a post-training supervision where relevant context is prepended to the response during training, but the loss is only computed over response tokens.

Result: Models trained with CINGS show stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains, improving performance on information-seeking tasks and reducing hallucinations in vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: CINGS enhances grounding without sacrificing general performance, showing promise for various applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

*Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi,Xiaodan Zhu,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARE introduces a new framework for efficient, high-quality automated process annotation to enhance multi-step reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for enhancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs remains a significant challenge.

Method: Introducing SPARE, a novel structured framework for single-pass annotation with reference-guided evaluation.

Result: SPARE improves reasoning performance on four datasets across three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: SPARE improves reasoning performance in both fine-tuning models for greedy-decoding and training reward models for ranking LLM-generated outputs. It also achieves good performance on mathematical datasets with higher efficiency.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [33] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework for detecting hyperboles and metaphors using bidirectional dynamic interaction. It improves performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of identifying hyperboles and metaphors due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity.

Method: An emotion-guided framework (EmoBi) with three modules: emotion analysis, emotion-based domain mapping, and bidirectional dynamic interaction.

Result: EmoBi outperforms baseline methods on four datasets, increasing F1 scores by 28.1% for hyperbole detection and 23.1% for metaphor detection.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows significant improvement in hyperbole and metaphor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

### [34] [Lessons from Training Grounded LLMs with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15522)
*Shang Hong Sim,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,Hai Leong Chieu,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Navonil Majumder,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how reinforcement learning and internal reasoning can improve grounding in large language models, demonstrating significant performance improvements over instruction-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to address the challenge of generating grounded and trustworthy responses in large language models, particularly focusing on improving answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality.

Method: The researchers use the GRPO method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards. They also explore a two-stage training setup and revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation.

Result: The reasoning-augmented models outperformed instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. The two-stage training setup further improved grounding.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven reinforcement learning in creating more verifiable and reliable large language models.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [35] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Local-global attention models face a tradeoff between performance and efficiency due to window size. The proposed RATTENTION approach integrates linear attention to capture out-of-window tokens, achieving better performance and efficiency balance, especially with a small window size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of local attention disregarding out-of-window tokens and improve the efficiency of local-global attention models.

Method: Introducing RATTENTION, a variant of local attention combined with a specialized linear attention mechanism.

Result: RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency, matching full-attention models' performance with a smaller window size, and improves long-context performance without sacrificing training efficiency.

Conclusion: RATTENTION offers a more efficient local-global attention model by effectively utilizing out-of-window token information and maintaining high performance even with reduced window sizes.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*John X. Morris,Junjie Oscar Yin,Woojeong Kim,Vitaly Shmatikov,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A gradient-based approach is proposed to approximate training data from model weights, showing effectiveness in recovering useful data and improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of closed training data in modern language models with open weights.

Method: Developing a gradient-based method to select matching data from a large public text corpus.

Result: The method improved classification performance and reduced perplexity, approaching expert benchmarks.

Conclusion: Data approximation from model weights is feasible and effective without access to the true training data.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

*Shufan Li,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces PredGen, a framework that uses speculative decoding to reduce latency in real-time voice chat apps using LLMs by up to 2x with minimal extra computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve user experience by reducing latency in real-time voice chat applications where LLMs are used with text-to-speech systems, especially on devices with limited computational resources.

Method: The proposed method involves speculative decoding at input time to generate candidate responses before the user finishes speaking, allowing earlier TTS processing.

Result: Simulations on Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the method can cut down latency by approximately 2x with negligible extra computation cost.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Predictive Generation (PredGen), which significantly reduces the latency in real-time voice chat applications using Large Language Models by generating candidate responses speculatively during user speech.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GIFI, a new metric for evaluating gender inclusivity in large language models, and uses it to assess 22 LLMs, uncovering significant differences in their inclusivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on gender fairness in language models focused mainly on binary genders, ignoring non-binary ones. This paper aims to provide a more inclusive evaluation method.

Method: The authors developed the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), which evaluates LLMs' handling of different gender pronouns and generation/cognitive behaviors under various gender assumptions.

Result: Extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 LLMs revealed significant variations in their gender inclusivity.

Conclusion: Improving inclusivity in LLMs is important, and GIFI provides a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a benchmark that can assess the ability of foundation models in verifying claims in a multimodal scientific context.

Method: Assessing the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models on SciVer.

Result: A substantial performance gap was found between these models and human experts on SciVer.

Conclusion: Identifying critical limitations in current open-source models and offering key insights to improve their comprehension and reasoning in multimodal scientific literature tasks.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal
scientific literature tasks.

### [40] [DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15583)
*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce DiscoSG, a new task for discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing, and propose DiscoSG-Refiner, an efficient method using two Flan-T5-Base models to improve SPICE and downstream VLM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for merging sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input often miss phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance.

Method: A new task called DiscoSG is created with a dataset named DiscoSG-DS containing 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs. Two Flan-T5-Base models are used in DiscoSG-Refiner to draft a base graph and iteratively propose graph edits.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also enhances downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Conclusion: Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG) is introduced to handle multi-sentence visual descriptions generated by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). DiscoSG-Refiner is proposed as an efficient method for improving DiscoSG.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

TL;DR: This paper presents WikiMixQA, a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts from Wikipedia pages. It shows that proprietary models perform better than open-source ones in this setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of automatic document understanding, especially for complex layouts, tables, and charts.

Method: Introducing WikiMixQA with 1,000 MCQs from 4,000 Wikipedia pages across seven topics, emphasizing complex reasoning.

Result: Proprietary models like GPT-4-o achieve ~70% accuracy with direct context and over 50% in retrieval tasks, while open-source models reach a maximum accuracy of 27%.

Conclusion: The study highlights the difficulties of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establishes WikiMixQA as an important benchmark for DU research.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

TL;DR: This study investigates the ability of current generative models to create multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for reading comprehension in Portuguese. It evaluates the quality of these MCQs, finding they are comparable to human-authored ones but identifies issues with semantic clarity and answerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of manually creating MCQs with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills, which is time-consuming and costly, by using generative AI to automate the process.

Method: Investigate the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, focusing on curriculum-relevant narrative elements and different difficulty levels. Evaluate these MCQs through expert review and analysis of psychometric properties from student responses.

Result: Current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones but face issues with semantic clarity and answerability. Challenges remain in creating engaging distractors that meet high-quality design criteria.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise for automating MCQ generation, but further research is needed to improve semantic clarity, answerability, and distractor quality.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods to study regret expressions in large language models, proposing workflows and metrics to identify optimal regret representation layers and neurons, revealing insights into information processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the regret mechanism in large language models is important for improving model reliability and understanding neural network cognition.

Method: Proposes a workflow for regret dataset construction, S-CDI metric for identifying optimal regret layers, and RDS and GIC metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons.

Result: Identified the optimal regret representation layer using S-CDI, found an M-shaped decoupling pattern, and categorized neurons into three functional groups.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of regret mechanisms in large language models and provides tools for future research.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### [45] [Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15629)
*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark evaluating LLMs' ordered concept generation and instruction-following abilities, revealing low diversity and identical outputs due to biases towards certain concept orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing generative commonsense reasoning tasks where LLMs fail to generate concepts in specified orders.

Method: Propose Ordered CommonGen benchmark to measure ordered coverage and assess LLMs' abilities.

Result: Found that LLMs have low-diversity outputs and biases toward specific concept orders, even the best LLM achieved only 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: Ordered CommonGen highlights the need for improving both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Result: ANN模型在使用5-gram特征时，在十五次运行中的四次实现了完美的分类。

Conclusion: ANN模型在罗语作者归属问题上表现出色，轻量级的字符n-gram方法可以达到最先进的准确性。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

TL;DR: Introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves large language models' reasoning reliability by training on cohorts of similar questions, leading to better accuracy and stability on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the consistent and robust reasoning ability of large language models.

Method: Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn) uses reinforcement learning to train on cohorts of similar questions with a composite objective including cohort accuracy, retrieval bonus, and rejection penalty.

Result: Experiments show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines on challenging reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning effectively enhances reasoning consistency in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study privacy issues in reasoning traces of large language models used as personal assistants, finding sensitive data leakage through prompt injection or accidental output, exacerbated by increased reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that reasoning traces of large language models are safe and internal.

Method: Probing and agentic evaluations on test-time compute approaches like increased reasoning steps.

Result: Reasoning traces often contain sensitive user data that can be leaked via prompt injections or accidentally into outputs; increasing reasoning steps amplifies this leakage.

Conclusion: Safety measures for models should extend beyond outputs to include internal reasoning.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the performance of 21 MT systems in preserving gender ambiguity across three translation directions, finding a lack of gender-neutral translations but identifying some systems employing specific strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent misgendering and representational harms in machine translation by preserving gender ambiguity in the source.

Method: Assessing sensitivity of 21 MT systems to gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions.

Result: Most MT systems do not provide gender-neutral translations when faced with gender ambiguity, though a few use specific strategies depending on the target language.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improvement in gender-neutral machine translation, particularly in grammatical gender languages.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

*Byung-Kwan Lee,Ryo Hachiuma,Yong Man Ro,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel, general-purpose distillation framework named Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal) is proposed to address the challenge of transferring knowledge between heterogeneous vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large vision-language models in real-world scenarios is challenging due to their high computational demands. Therefore, there is an interest in distilling knowledge from large models to smaller ones.

Method: The GenRecal framework includes a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous models to enable effective knowledge transfer.

Result: Experiments show that GenRecal improves baseline performances and outperforms large-scale open- and closed-source vision-language models.

Conclusion: GenRecal provides a way to effectively transfer knowledge between different types of vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

*Yuhui Shi,Yehan Yang,Qiang Sheng,Hao Mi,Beizhe Hu,Chaoxi Xu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method called PhantomHunter is proposed to detect text generated by unseen, privately-tuned large language models, showing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of large language models has led to increased misinformation and academic misconduct, making the detection of such generated texts crucial. However, existing detection methods suffer from a performance drop when dealing with text from privately fine-tuned models.

Method: PhantomHunter uses a family-aware learning framework that identifies shared traits across base models and their derivatives rather than focusing on individual characteristics.

Result: PhantomHunter outperforms seven baselines and three industrial services in experiments involving data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families, achieving F1 scores above 96%.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter effectively addresses the challenge of detecting text from privately fine-tuned large language models, demonstrating strong performance and potential impact on mitigating misinformation and academic misconduct.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

### [52] [Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15041)
*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o in extracting economic narratives from texts compared to traditional pipelines using models like BERT. It finds that while GPT-4o can extract valid narratives, it doesn't match expert-level performance especially with complex documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting economic narratives against traditional NLP techniques.

Method: Analyzed a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times articles about inflation using GPT-4o and compared its outputs to gold-standard narratives by expert annotators.

Result: GPT-4o can extract valid economic narratives but struggles with complex documents and narratives compared to experts.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in economic narrative extraction but need further development to reach expert levels.

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework named ETS is introduced, which combines EEG and eye-tracking data to tackle open-vocabulary text generation and sentiment classification tasks. The model demonstrates excellent results in EEG-To-Text decoding and EEG-based ternary sentiment classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of noise and variability in traditional methods when dealing with open-vocabulary scenarios in decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive EEG.

Method: ETS framework integrating EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data.

Result: Superior performance on BLEU and Rouge scores for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification.

Conclusion: The proposed ETS model shows great potential for high-performance open vocabulary EEG-to-text systems.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Motivation: 计算一个LLM中的一个8位权重在预训练期间需要$10^{13}$-$10^{15}$次浮点运算，这非常昂贵且似乎效率低下。为了更好地利用对预训练模型的巨大投资，提出了一种新的方法来创建子模型。

Method: 提出了一种名为'专家组装'(AoE)的新方法，该方法以线性时间创建现有混合专家模型的有能力的子模型变体。

Result: 通过改变从父模型获取的权重比例，观察到AoE子模型的一些属性逐渐变化，而其他行为特征则出现急剧转变。令人惊讶的是，几乎每个生成的模型都是功能齐全且有能力的，这使得搜索模型空间变得简单。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以有效地生成具有不同特性的子模型，这些子模型在性能上接近其父模型，并且构造过程不需要微调或蒸馏。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: To explore the broader applicability of RL in improving LLMs' general reasoning ability beyond math and code.

Method: Curate Guru, a 92K example RL reasoning dataset across Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular domains. Revisit RL findings for LLM reasoning using Guru.

Result: Observation of significant variation in RL benefits across domains. RL helps acquire skills in less-pretrained domains like Logic, Simulation, and Tabular. Guru-7B and Guru-32B achieve SOTA performance on 17 tasks across six domains.

Conclusion: RL can facilitate genuine skill acquisition in LLM reasoning, especially in domains with limited pretraining exposure. Release of data, models, and code to promote general-purpose reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

### [56] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics of large language models, showing that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics interpolate between the μP regime and the Large Vocab (LV) Regime, where optimal scaling rules differ from those predicted by μP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the pretraining process of large language models more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. However, one limitation of the theory behind μP is that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity, which is unrealistic.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, followed by experiments to validate the theory.

Result: The paper shows that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics interpolate between the μP regime and the LV regime, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by μP. The optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as Θ(√width) in the LV regime, surprisingly close to empirical findings previously reported in the literature.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics of large language models, revealing that the optimal scaling rules in the LV regime are different from those predicted by μP.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

*Yingcong Li,Xiangyu Chang,Muti Kara,Xiaofeng Liu,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Samet Oymak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Even when some labeled data are missing, recent studies show that in-context learning (ICL) still works well. This study looks at how one-layer linear attention models and multilayer transformers handle this situation. It turns out that while one-layer models can't use unlabeled data, multilayer transformers can by creating specific mathematical estimators. These transformers can be improved by adding more layers or loops, which helps them perform better in semi-supervised learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even with missing or incorrect labels.

Method: Examining binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) demonstrations with some missing labels, studying the loss landscapes of one-layer linear attention models and multilayer transformers.

Result: One-layer linear attention models cannot utilize unlabeled data, whereas multilayer transformers can create estimators that effectively leverage unlabeled data. Transformers can be enhanced for semi-supervised learning by increasing depth or adding loops.

Conclusion: Adding more layers or loops to transformers improves their ability to handle semi-supervised learning tasks, particularly with tabular data.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method called PRISM is introduced to provide more detailed descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features in neural networks, improving the accuracy and faithfulness of feature descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current feature description methods which assume each neuron encodes only a single concept, despite evidence suggesting otherwise.

Method: Introducing PRISM, a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features by providing nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features.

Result: PRISM demonstrates more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, enhancing both overall description quality and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present.

Conclusion: The introduction of PRISM offers a significant advancement in automated interpretability research, providing more robust feature descriptions for neural networks.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), a training-free method to enhance the safety robustness of aligned large language models by extrapolating the safety subspace. LoX demonstrates significant improvements in robustness against benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of aligned large language models to fine-tuning undermining their safety protections.

Method: Proposing a novel training-free method called Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX) to extrapolate the safety subspace of an aligned LLM.

Result: LoX shows 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks, and moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone making them less sensitive to perturbations.

Conclusion: LoX is effective in enhancing the safety robustness of aligned large language models without sacrificing their adaptability to new tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

### [60] [AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651)
*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule is an automated system for deriving rule-based rewards from preference feedback in reinforcement learning from human feedback tasks, leading to improved performance compared to baselines without such rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for rule-based rewards in RLHF rely heavily on manual rule engineering, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Method: AutoRule extracts rules in three stages: interpreting preferences, identifying candidate rules, and synthesizing them into a unified set. It then uses language-model verifiers to calculate rule satisfaction as an auxiliary reward.

Result: The approach improves performance metrics on specific benchmarks compared to a baseline without rule-based auxiliary rewards, shows less reward hacking, and captures valuable dataset-specific qualities.

Conclusion: AutoRule automates the process of creating rule-based rewards from preference feedback, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency gains in reinforcement learning from human feedback.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

### [61] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used for extracting interpretable features from language models with sparsity constraints. This study investigates dense latents in SAEs, showing they form antipodal pairs, have intrinsic properties, and can be categorized into different classes such as position tracking and entropy regulation. These features evolve from structural to semantic and output-oriented signals across model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the nature of dense latents in SAEs which were previously considered as undesirable artifacts of training.

Method: Systematic investigation including demonstrating the geometry and function of dense latents, introducing a taxonomy, and analyzing their evolution across layers.

Result: Dense latents are persistent, form antipodal pairs, reflect meaningful model representations, and can be classified into several categories. They evolve from structural to semantic and output-oriented signals across layers.

Conclusion: Dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

TL;DR: Proposed HAC, a unified neural speech codec with a factorized bottleneck into acoustic, phonetic, and lexical levels, achieving better disentanglement and reconstruction quality than single-level baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified neural speech codec that can factorize its bottleneck into three linguistic levels within a single model.

Method: Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC) factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. It leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.

Result: Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SemIRNet, a novel network for multimodal irony detection that uses ConceptNet for common-sense reasoning, two cross-modal semantic similarity modules, and contrastive learning to improve accuracy and F1 score by 1.64% and 2.88% respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately identifying implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks.

Method: Introducing ConceptNet for conceptual knowledge, designing two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules, and using a contrastive learning loss function.

Result: Improved accuracy and F1 value by 1.64% and 2.88% respectively compared to existing optimal methods.

Conclusion: Knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection play crucial roles in enhancing model performance.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights for improving MLLMs.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with
two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while
incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Result: 视频-SALMONN 2 在字幕生成任务中的错误率降低了28%，并在相同规模的模型中表现出色。

Conclusion: 视频-SALMONN 2 展现了卓越的视频字幕生成能力，同时保持了与其他先进模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to provide visually impaired individuals with a more effective way to access books of their choice beyond just Braille books and audio recordings provided by NGOs.

Method: The method used was the development of an accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition (OCR)-based speech synthesis system using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

Result: The result was the successful implementation of an OCR-based speech synthesis system which can convert printed text into speech, aiding visually impaired individuals in accessing information.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the developed OCR-based speech synthesis system is an effective tool for knowledge extraction through sound for visually impaired individuals.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and detailed music captions can enhance music databases and push forward music AI research.

Method: The method involves a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens and detects music features through dedicated auxiliary heads.

Result: The experimental results show that incorporating music features improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Conclusion: This paper presents a multi-task music captioning model called SonicVerse which integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Result: 发现流行的LLM对于模拟不同种族、年龄和收入群体的争议性问题中的意见是不适合的。

Conclusion: 强调了在社会科学研究中使用LLMs时需要新的实践，而不仅仅是对人类主体进行简单的模拟。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

Motivation: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements.

Conclusion: Our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.
