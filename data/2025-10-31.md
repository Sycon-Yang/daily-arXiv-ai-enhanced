### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们的研究介绍了StreetMath基准，用于评估大型语言模型在现实世界近似场景中的近似能力，并发现它们在近似任务中倾向于计算精确值或调用外部工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要关注大型语言模型在精确算术操作中的表现，而对非自回归解码器模型在非正式、快节奏数学操作中的近似推理能力的研究较少。

Method: 我们引入了StreetMath基准来评估模型在现实世界近似场景中的近似能力，并应用了机制可解释性技术来探测其内部计算状态。

Result: 我们的分析表明，LLMs通常尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具，即使在需要近似的任务中也是如此。此外，模型有时在早期层或步骤中得到正确答案，但在解决近似任务时仍然消耗更多标记。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在近似推理任务中的表现，表明它们通常尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具，即使任务要求近似。此外，我们发现精确和近似的算术操作依赖于不同的神经组件。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的方法，用于对实体进行排名，并通过分类意见词到不同的粒度级别来提高情感分析的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的整体词典方法没有考虑每个意见的强度，例如非常强烈的负面（或正面）意见、强烈的负面（或正面）意见、中等负面（或正面）意见、非常弱的负面（或正面）意见和弱的负面（或正面）意见。因此，本文旨在解决这一问题，提高情感分析的准确性。

Method: 本文使用模糊逻辑算法来分类意见词，并使用句法依赖解析来找到所需方面词的关系。同时，将与特定产品方面相关的意见词考虑在内，以计算该方面的实体评分。

Result: 本文提出的方法能够根据实体评论和用户查询的方向和强度对实体进行排名，并通过分类意见词到不同的粒度级别（即非常弱、弱、中等、非常强和强）来提高情感分析的精度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于整体词典的方法，通过结合与特定产品方面相关的意见词（如副词、形容词、名词和动词），对实体进行排名，并利用模糊逻辑算法和句法依赖解析来分类意见词并找到所需方面词的关系。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了LASTIST数据集，以填补立场检测研究中的空白，并为各种立场检测任务提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的研究主要集中在目标依赖的立场检测任务上，且大多数基准数据集基于英语，这使得在低资源语言如韩语中开发模型变得困难。因此，需要一个大规模的、目标独立的立场检测数据集。

Method: 本文介绍了如何收集和构建LASTIST数据集，并训练了最先进的深度学习和立场检测模型。

Result: 本文提出了LASTIST数据集，包含563,299个标记的韩语句子，并提供了详细的数据集收集和构建描述。

Conclusion: 本文提出了LASTIST数据集，以填补立场检测研究中的空白，并为各种立场检测任务提供支持。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: zFLoRA reduces latency while maintaining performance in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The additional compute from task-specific adapters is significant during inference, despite their small size.

Method: Proposed a new zero-latency fused low-rank adapter (zFLoRA) to reduce inference time.

Result: Experiments on LLMs of various sizes showed that zFLoRA performs favorably against benchmarks like LoRA and FFT.

Conclusion: zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to negligible latency overhead and perform well compared to other methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

### [5] [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Improving Circuit Faithfulness via Better Edge Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25786)
*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出三种改进方法以提高电路发现的准确性，包括使用自助法、基于比率的选择策略和整数线性规划公式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机械可解释性中的电路发现是主要挑战之一，确定模型中哪些部分执行给定任务。

Method: 我们使用自助法识别具有稳定归因分数的边，引入基于比率的选择策略来优先考虑强正评分的边，并用整数线性规划公式替换标准的贪心选择。

Result: 我们的方法能够生成更忠实的电路，并在多个MIB任务和模型中优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个MIB任务和模型中优于之前的方法，能够生成更忠实的电路。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LISTEN框架，利用大型语言模型作为零样本偏好代理，通过自然语言引导多目标决策，减少了传统偏好获取的认知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类专家在从大量项目中选择最佳选项时常常遇到困难，这个过程受到难以形式化复杂、隐含偏好的瓶颈制约。

Method: 本文介绍了LISTEN框架，该框架利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为零样本偏好代理，仅受专家的高层优先级指导。提出了两种迭代算法：LISTEN-U和LISTEN-T。

Result: 在飞行预订、购物和考试安排等多样化任务上进行评估，结果表明LISTEN-U在偏好参数对齐时表现出色，而LISTEN-T提供了更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 本文探索了通过自然语言直接引导复杂多目标决策的有前途的方向，减少了传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter是一种用于长上下文预训练数据集筛选的框架，通过评估扩展上下文的信息增益来选择高质量数据，从而提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大量可用的长文本数据缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，训练这样的数据效率低下，因此需要仔细选择数据。

Method: LongFilter通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测结果，衡量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，从而识别出需要长距离依赖性的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B上进行的实验表明，LongFilter能够高效地选择高质量的数据，并在HEL MET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试中取得显著提升。

Conclusion: LongFilter能够有效地选择高质量的数据，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究发现，角色设定可能在大型语言模型的输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，这引发了对以中立名义可能强化党派观点的AI系统的担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型在内容审核系统中的公平性和中立性至关重要，但角色设定可能会影响模型的判断，因此需要对此进行研究。

Method: 本研究分析了角色设定如何影响不同大型语言模型架构、模型大小和内容模态（语言与视觉）对有害内容分类的一致性和公平性。此外，还进行了一项针对政治目标任务的额外研究。

Result: 研究发现，角色设定会影响模型对有害内容的判断，不同意识形态的角色表现出不同的倾向，将内容标记为有害。较大的模型更倾向于与同一意识形态的角色保持一致，从而加强内部一致性并扩大跨意识形态群体的分歧。此外，在政治目标任务中，角色不仅在其自身意识形态内表现出更一致的行为，还倾向于捍卫自己的观点并淡化对立观点的有害性。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，角色设定可能会在大型语言模型的输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，这引发了对以中立名义可能强化党派观点的AI系统的担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lopez等人在2025年引入的临床实体增强检索（CLEAR）方法通过实体感知检索实现了更高的性能，F1得分为0.90，相比基于嵌入的检索方法提高了0.86，同时使用了70%以上的更少标记。评估平台在12份临床笔记上测试，结果表明CLEAR在长文档中表现尤为出色，提供了可重复且透明的基准来评估临床问答系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）将临床文档存储为FHIR DocumentReference资源中的base64编码附件，这使得语义问答变得困难。传统的向量数据库方法常常忽略了细微的临床关系。

Method: CLEAR方法使用实体感知检索，在F1分数上达到了0.90，比基于嵌入的检索方法提高了0.86，同时使用了70%以上的更少标记。开发了一个临床笔记QA评估平台，以验证CLEAR与零样本大上下文推理和传统基于块的检索增强生成进行比较。

Result: CLEAR在12份临床笔记上进行了测试，每份笔记包含10,000到65,000个标记，代表真实的EHR内容。CLEAR取得了58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度为0.878，并且使用的标记比宽上下文处理减少了78%。在长笔记中，性能提升最大，超过65,000个标记的文档有75%的胜率。

Conclusion: 这些发现证实了实体感知检索在临床自然语言处理中提高了效率和准确性。评估框架提供了一个可重复且透明的基准，用于评估需要语义精度和计算效率的临床问答系统。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

*Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Arthur Lorenzi,Lisandra Bonoto,Lívia Ruiz,Luiz Fernando Pereira,Victor Herbst,Yulla Navarro,Helen de Andrade Abreu,Lívia Dutra,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了基于LLM的语义角色标注器在FrameNet-like语义标注中的应用，发现半自动标注在框架多样性方面优于人工标注，而自动标注在所有指标上表现较差，除了标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM工具在语言研究中具有潜力，但对其性能和对标注数据集创建的影响进行全面评估仍然缺失，尤其是在以视角化方法进行NLP的情况下。

Method: 本文比较了三种实验设置下的标注时间、覆盖率和多样性：人工、自动和半自动标注。

Result: 结果表明，与人工标注相比，半自动标注设置在框架多样性方面有所提高，而自动标注在所有指标上表现较差，除了标注时间。

Conclusion: 本文通过广泛的评估，展示了基于LLM的语义角色标注器在FrameNet-like语义标注中的应用，表明半自动标注设置在框架多样性方面优于人工标注，而自动标注在所有指标上表现较差，除了标注时间。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP is a pipeline designed to extract and verify memorized training data from LLM outputs, leading to significant improvements in extracting copyrighted text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind RECAP is to determine what a large language model (LLM) has seen during training when the training data cannot be inspected directly.

Method: RECAP is an agentic pipeline that uses a feedback-driven loop to extract and verify memorized training data from LLM outputs. It includes a jailbreaking module to overcome alignment-induced refusals.

Result: RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches in extracting copyrighted text from LLM outputs. For example, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47.

Conclusion: RECAP is effective in extracting and verifying memorized training data from LLM outputs, leading to substantial improvements over single-iteration approaches.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

### [13] [Revisiting Multilingual Data Mixtures in Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25947)
*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了多语言数据混合对预训练大型语言模型的影响，发现适当的平衡多语言数据可以增强模型能力而不影响性能，甚至在低资源环境中也有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨多语言预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）中不同多语言数据混合的影响，以及是否存在语言覆盖范围和模型性能之间的权衡（即多语言的诅咒）。

Method: 通过在多样化的多语言语料库上训练1.1B和3B参数的LLM，研究了不同多语言数据混合的影响，变化的语言数量从25到400。

Result: 研究发现，将英语和多语言数据结合并不会损害任何一组的语言内性能，前提是语言在预训练语料库中有足够的标记数。使用英语作为桥梁语言可以带来跨语言家族的好处，而选择特定家族内的桥梁语言并不总是能提高该家族内语言的性能。此外，没有观察到随着训练语言数量增加而出现显著的“多语言诅咒”。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，只要多语言数据平衡得当，就可以在不损害性能的情况下增强语言模型的能力，即使在低资源环境下也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究发现，机器翻译系统在翻译过程中可能导致标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域。大型语言模型虽然编码了文化知识，但这也可能加剧标签漂移。文化相似性或差异性是影响标签保留的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在探讨文化对机器翻译中语义标签的影响，特别是在低资源语言中，由于文化差异可能导致标签漂移的问题。

Method: 通过一系列实验，我们在文化敏感和中性领域进行了研究，分析了机器翻译系统（包括现代大型语言模型）在翻译过程中产生的标签漂移现象。

Result: 研究发现了三个关键结果：(1) 机器翻译系统，包括现代大型语言模型，在翻译过程中会导致标签漂移，尤其是在文化敏感领域；(2) 与早期的统计机器翻译工具不同，大型语言模型编码了文化知识，并利用这些知识可能会加剧标签漂移；(3) 源语言和目标语言之间的文化相似性或差异性是标签保留的重要决定因素。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，在机器翻译中忽视文化因素不仅会损害标签的准确性，还可能在下游应用中导致误解和文化冲突。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode是一种神经符号框架，通过将数学问题解决任务重新表述为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，提高了大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中的准确性，并使其故障从模糊的逻辑谬误转变为透明的程序错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂的数学推理中经常遇到困难，其中基于文本的生成导致未经验证且算术不严谨的解决方案。当前的提示策略如思维链仍然在这个不可靠的媒介中运作，缺乏确定性验证的机制。

Method: SymCode是一种神经符号框架，它将数学问题解决任务重新表述为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务。

Result: 我们在具有挑战性的基准测试上评估了SymCode，包括MATH-500和OlympiadBench，展示了相对于基线的显著准确性提升，最高达13.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM推理扎根于确定性符号引擎，SymCode代表了在正式领域中更准确和可信赖的人工智能的重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium架构的异构性和对数据布局的特殊要求使得充分利用其性能变得具有挑战性。

Method: 基于内核融合和新颖的缓存策略，针对Trainium架构定制了一系列技术。

Result: 在九个数据集和四个最近的LLM上评估，我们的系统在matmul内核级别平均提速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），在端到端LLM推理中平均提速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 本文设计了一种高性能的矩阵乘法（matmul）算法，用于在Trainium上进行LLM推理，通过减少数据移动、最大化SRAM带宽和避免昂贵的矩阵转置，显著提高了性能。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多实际工作负载中，如分类、问答、推荐和文本嵌入，仅依赖于预填阶段，而自注意力计算成为性能瓶颈。

Method: AttnCache通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来加速预填阶段的自注意力计算。

Result: 实验结果表明，AttnCache在CPU上实现了平均1.2倍的端到端速度提升和2倍的注意力速度提升，在GPU上实现了1.6倍的端到端速度提升和3倍的注意力速度提升，且准确性几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: AttnCache能够显著加速LLM推理的预填阶段，同时保持几乎无损的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SRL的框架，用于解决小规模开源模型在多步骤推理任务中遇到的问题。SRL通过生成一系列逻辑“动作”来重新定义问题解决过程，并提供基于模型动作与专家动作相似性的逐步奖励。这种监督方式即使所有rollouts都是错误的也能提供更丰富的学习信号，同时鼓励由专家演示引导的灵活推理。实验结果表明，SRL使小型模型能够学习之前无法通过SFT或RLVR学习的挑战性问题，并且在初始化训练后使用SRL再进行RLVR优化可以获得最佳整体性能。此外，SRL在代理软件工程任务中表现出良好的泛化能力，证明了其作为面向推理的LLM的稳健和多功能训练框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation.

Method: SRL reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical 'actions'. It trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner.

Result: SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: PORTool是一种基于强化学习的方法，通过探索不同的工具调用轨迹来提高语言模型在动态环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的工具使用大型语言模型在动态工具调用环境中表现有限，因为它们模仿通用的工具调用流程，未能探索可能的解决方案。

Method: PORTool是一种基于强化学习的方法，它通过生成多个轨迹并为每个步骤分配奖励来训练语言模型进行工具使用。

Result: 实验使用17个工具来解决用户查询，覆盖了时间敏感和时间无关的主题，并通过消融研究验证了步骤奖励的必要性和设计鲁棒性。此外，与其它训练方法相比，PORTool在最终准确性和工具调用步骤数量上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: PORTool通过鼓励语言模型探索不同的工具调用轨迹来提高性能，实验表明其在最终准确性以及工具调用步骤数量上都有显著提升。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

TL;DR: 本文研究了跨语言对齐中的文化消亡问题，提出了一种新的方法Surgical Steering，以更好地平衡知识迁移和文化定位之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐旨在对齐多语言表示，使大型语言模型能够无缝地在不同语言之间转移知识。然而，这种追求表征收敛的做法可能导致“文化消亡”，即功能上失去提供基于查询语言的文化情境响应的能力。因此，本文旨在系统分析这一权衡，并提出一种更好的解决方案。

Method: 本文引入了一个全面的评估框架——转移-定位平面，用于量化知识迁移和文化消亡的程度，并基于此框架重新评估了最近的跨语言对齐方法。此外，还提出了Surgical Steering方法，通过针对不同模型层进行激活引导来实现两个目标的解耦。

Result: 本文发现，现有的跨语言对齐方法在提升事实迁移的同时，会直接导致所有六种语言的文化定位损失。此外，通过研究模型内部表示，发现普遍的事实迁移和文化特定知识可以在不同的模型层上最优地控制。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的推理时方法——Surgical Steering，该方法能够更好地平衡跨语言对齐中的知识迁移和文化定位之间的权衡，克服了当前对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 研究开发并验证了一个自然语言处理（NLP）管道，用于识别影像学报告中的意外甲状腺发现（ITFs），并评估其流行率、特征和临床结果。结果显示，ITFs常见，并与导致检测到小的、低风险癌症的后续流程有关。这些发现强调了ITFs在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用，并需要标准化报告和更选择性的随访。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and clinical consequences remain undefined.

Method: A transformer-based NLP pipeline identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from multiple modalities and body regions.

Result: Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9% women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF.

Conclusion: ITFs were common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small, low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective follow-up.

Motivation: 由于在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）中，自动编程代码生成任务尚未得到充分探索，因此我们提出了QCoder基准。

Method: 我们引入了QCoder基准，这是一个评估框架，用于评估LLMs在量子编程中的表现，并从模拟硬件设备中获取反馈。

Result: 即使先进的模型如GPT-4o也只能达到约18.97%的准确性，而基于推理的模型如o3可以达到高达78%的准确性，超过了人类编写代码的平均成功率（39.98%）。

Conclusion: 我们释放了QCoder基准数据集和公共评估API以支持进一步的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低多样性的模型输出问题，这主要是由于常见的“一个问题，一个解决方案”（1P1S）训练实践导致模型趋向于狭窄的推理路径。

Method: 提出了一种“一个问题，多个解决方案”（1PNS）的训练范式，并引入了推理路径分歧（RPD）作为度量方法，以捕捉中间推理中的差异。

Result: 实验表明，RPD选择的训练在提高输出多样性方面效果更好，pass@k指标有所提升，在pass@16上平均提升了2.80%，在AIME24上提升了4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS进一步增强了TTS的效果，通过引入RPD度量方法，提高了模型输出的多样性。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

TL;DR: MossNet is a new architecture for large language models that uses a mixture-of-state-space-experts approach to emulate multi-head attention, resulting in better performance and efficiency compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially limiting their expressiveness. The goal is to create a more expressive and efficient architecture for large language models (LLMs).

Method: MossNet is a novel mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head attention (MHA). It leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks and time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple 'attention heads.'

Result: Extensive experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens, confirm its scalability and superior performance. Real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU demonstrates favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly sized baselines.

Conclusion: MossNet is a compelling new direction for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size

further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU

for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Motivation: 为了提高现有预训练解码器-only Transformer LMs的统计效率并减少拒绝情况，需要一种新的方法来优化模型的预测能力。

Method: 通过在训练过程中使用最终层的SDM激活层来估计监督下一个标记损失的基变换，并结合在线生成的硬负例进行监督微调，将现有的预训练解码器-only Transformer LMs转换为SDM LMs。

Result: SDM语言模型在减少拒绝方面表现出色，相比强大的监督基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: SDM语言模型可以通过监督微调将现有的预训练解码器-only Transformer LMs转换为具有更少拒绝和更高统计效率的模型。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

### [27] [RCScore: Quantifying Response Consistency in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26193)
*Dongjun Jang,Youngchae Ahn,Hyopil Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore 是一种评估 LLM 对指令风格敏感性的框架，能够揭示传统指标未检测到的性能变化，并提供了一种衡量模型可靠性的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 LLM 评估通常依赖于单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这在实际部署中是一个关键问题。

Method: RCScore 是一种多维框架，通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格，量化指令格式对模型响应的影响。此外，引入了 Cross-Response Similarity (CRS) 方法来测量风格一致性，并与任务准确性建立了强相关性。

Result: 实验结果表明，指令风格可以影响准确率高达 16.7 个百分点。确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性呈正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore 提供了一种评估指令鲁棒性的原则性方法，有助于提高模型在实际部署中的可靠性。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

TL;DR: 本文提出TTA方法，通过时间步分配实现软性顺序，以解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，并在多个任务中取得了显著的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散语言模型在实际控制方面仍然脆弱，需要解决更新遗忘的问题。

Method: 提出了一种称为Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)的方法，通过每个标记的时间步计划实现软性和语义标记顺序。

Result: TTA在情感控制任务中提高了准确性并降低了困惑度，在去毒任务中降低了最大毒性分数和困惑度。

Conclusion: TTA通过时间步分配实现软性顺序，是缓解更新遗忘和实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键杠杆。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

*Rajiv Movva,Smitha Milli,Sewon Min,Emma Pierson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WIMHF is a method that uses sparse autoencoders to explain feedback data, revealing human preferences and enabling better understanding and use of preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data encodes, and automatically extracting relevant features without pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging.

Method: WIMHF is a method that explains feedback data using sparse autoencoders, characterizing the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring and the preferences that annotators actually express.

Result: WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer and the role of dataset-level context. WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences and enables effective data curation and fine-grained personalization.

Conclusion: WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GlobalRAG，一种针对全局RAG任务的多工具协作框架，通过结构连贯性保留、智能过滤和精确符号计算，显著提升了全局RAG的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG任务，而许多实际应用需要能够跨整个文档集合进行信息聚合和分析的全局RAG能力。然而，现有的RAG方法在处理全局任务时表现不佳，因此需要新的方法来提升其性能。

Method: 本文介绍了GlobalRAG，这是一种多工具协作框架，旨在解决全局RAG任务中的挑战。它包括块级检索以保持结构连贯性、LLM驱动的智能过滤器以消除噪声文档以及用于精确符号计算的聚合模块。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有的RAG方法在全局任务上的表现较差，最强的基线仅达到1.51 F1分数。而GlobalRAG在Qwen2.5-14B模型上达到了6.63 F1分数，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了GlobalRAG，一种多工具协作框架，通过保留块级检索的结构连贯性、引入LLM驱动的智能过滤器以消除噪声文档，并集成聚合模块进行精确的符号计算，有效提升了全局RAG的能力。实验结果表明，GlobalRAG在Qwen2.5-14B模型上取得了显著优于现有基线的效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究展示了一种通过将语用理论作为提示提供给语言模型来提高其理解隐含意义能力的方法，并取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型需要具备准确解释隐含意义的能力，以更好地进行人类交流和语言使用。

Method: 我们提出了一种方法，其中语用理论的概述（如Gricean语用学和关联理论）作为提示提供给语言模型，引导其通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线相比（即提示中间推理而不呈现语用理论），我们的方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上的得分提高了高达9.6%。此外，即使不详细解释语用理论，仅在提示中提及它们的名称也会在大型模型上带来一定的性能提升（约1-3%）。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，将语用理论作为提示提供给语言模型是一种有效的上下文学习方法，用于理解隐含意义的任务。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了预训练语言模型在识别借词方面的表现，发现它们在区分借词和本族词汇方面效果不佳，这对开发针对少数语言的NLP工具有重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否能够区分借词和本族词汇，特别是在双语社区中，这有助于开发针对少数语言的NLP工具。

Method: 我们评估了多种模型在10种语言中的表现，以研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似的能力来识别借词。

Result: 尽管有明确的指令和上下文信息，我们的结果表明模型在区分借词和本族词汇方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 我们的工作对开发针对少数语言的NLP工具和支持受强势语言词汇压力的社区的语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 本文对五种知识蒸馏方法进行了受控的实证研究，以分析它们在跨语言表示一致性和模型压缩下的下游性能稳定性。结果表明，某些配置可以在模型大小减半的情况下保持或提高多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了设计敏感的权衡。


<details>

Motivation: 视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在不同语言中的表现不一致，当模型规模减小时问题更加严重。虽然知识蒸馏（KD）在将知识从大型VLM转移到小型VLM中显示出有希望的结果，但在多语言环境下应用KD是一个研究不足的领域。

Method: 本文进行了一项受控的实证研究，分析了五种蒸馏方法在跨语言表示一致性和模型压缩下的下游性能稳定性方面的行为。

Result: 一些配置在模型大小减半的情况下可以保持甚至提高多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，暴露了设计敏感的权衡，这些权衡仅凭聚合准确性无法揭示。

Conclusion: 本文发现，一些配置在模型大小减半的情况下可以保持甚至提高多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他配置无法维持跨任务稳定性，暴露了设计敏感的权衡，这些权衡仅凭聚合准确性无法揭示。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经元一致性的无监督解码方法NAD，通过内部信号实现高效的无标签集成解码，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略仅使用外部输出（如标记概率、熵或自我评估）对候选进行评分，这些信号在训练后可能校准不良。因此，需要一种更可靠的方法来提升推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于神经元一致性的解码方法（NAD），该方法仅使用内部信号进行候选选择，无需比较文本输出。

Result: NAD在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当，在开放式的编码基准测试中表现优于Avg@64。通过早期剪枝，NAD将令牌使用量减少了99%，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: NAD利用内部信号提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的无标签集成解码指导，通过早期正确性预测和激进的提前停止，显著减少了令牌使用量，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的工作表明，不同的大型语言模型（LLMs）会收敛到相似且准确的数字输入嵌入表示。这些发现与记录的大型语言模型在处理数字信息时产生错误输出的倾向相矛盾。因此，我们旨在解释这一矛盾。

Method: 我们探索了语言模型如何操作数字并量化这些机制的准确性下限。

Result: 尽管出现错误，不同的语言模型学习到的数字表示是可互换的，系统性、高度准确且在隐藏状态和输入上下文类型中普遍适用。这使我们能够为每个LLM创建通用探测器，并将包括输出错误原因的信息追溯到特定层。

Conclusion: 我们的结果为预训练大型语言模型如何处理数字提供了基本理解，并概述了更准确的探测技术在改进大型语言模型架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: Atlas shows strong analytical skills in logical tasks but struggles with real-time web interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess Atlas's performance in dynamic, interactive environments and identify its strengths and weaknesses.

Method: We conducted an early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based games as test scenarios.

Result: Atlas performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku but struggles in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control.

Conclusion: Atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing but has notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SCRIBE框架，该框架结合特定领域工具和自我反思推理流程，通过两阶段LoRA微调生成有效反馈。评估显示，8B-SCRIBE模型在关键维度上表现优异，且在隐私敏感和低资源教育应用中具有可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型可以用于教育环境中提供交互式、个性化的学生反馈。然而，现实世界的部署面临三个关键挑战：隐私问题、有限的计算资源以及需要教学有效的回应。这些限制要求小型开源模型可以在本地运行，并可靠地在其输出中基于正确信息。

Method: 我们引入了SCRIBE，这是一个多跳、工具增强的推理框架，旨在生成关于反馈报告的有效响应。SCRIBE结合了特定领域的工具和自我反思的推理流程，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复。我们通过两阶段LoRA微调，在合成GPT-4o生成的数据上将这些能力提炼为3B和8B模型。

Result: 使用与人类对齐的GPT-Judge和一项有108名学生的用户研究评估显示，8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上与更大的模型相当或更优，同时被学生认为与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了SCRIBE在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform in specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep, principled understanding.

Method: ACER transforms generalist models into domain experts by synthesizing a comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum and using it for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule.

Result: Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized MMLU subsets, with improvements of up to 5 percentage points in challenging domains like microeconomics. ACER also prevents catastrophic forgetting and facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了OmniEduBench，一个全面的中文教育基准，用于评估LLMs在教育领域的表现，结果显示LLMs在知识和培养维度上仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs和其基准主要关注知识维度，忽视了培养能力的评估，且当前基准通常局限于单一学科或题型，缺乏多样性。

Method: 引入了OmniEduBench，这是一个全面的中文教育基准，包含24.602K高质量的问答对，并将其分为知识维度和培养维度。

Result: 在知识维度中，只有Gemini-2.5 Pro的准确率超过了60%，而在培养维度中，表现最好的模型QWQ仍比人类智能差近30%。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了在教育领域应用LLMs的显著改进空间和挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

*Zeliang Zong,Kai Zhang,Zheyang Li,Wenming Tan,Ye Ren,Yiyan Zhai,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSLC is a new method that combines sparse optimization and low-rank approximation to compress large language models efficiently without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of LLMs is limited by high bandwidth and computational demands, and existing methods like pruning and low-rank approximation have not been effectively combined.

Method: SSLC combines sparse optimization and low-rank approximation through iterative optimization to compress LLMs.

Result: SSLC outperforms standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models with up to 50% compression and 1.63x speedup.

Conclusion: SSLC provides a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment by compressing models without performance loss.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯网络的LLM融合框架（BNLF），通过概率机制整合多个LLM的预测结果，以提高情感分析的准确性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在透明度、可解释性、微调成本、提示工程、跨领域结果一致性以及环境影响方面存在挑战，因此需要一种更有效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: BNLF框架通过贝叶斯网络将FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet的预测结果进行概率融合，以实现情感分析。

Result: BNLF框架在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库中，相比基线LLM取得了约6%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: BNLF框架在三个金融语料库中表现出约6%的准确率提升，证明了其对数据集变化的鲁棒性和概率融合在可解释情感分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 这项研究旨在确定多个大语言模型的集合是否可以共同提供比单个大语言模型更可靠的像素级AI分诊工具评估。结果表明，由中型到大型开源大语言模型组成的集合提供了更一致和可靠的方法来推导出临床AI分诊工具的地面真实回顾性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集合是否可以共同提供比单个LLM更可靠的像素级AI分诊工具评估。

Method: 29,766例非对比头部CT检查从十四家医院处理了一个商业性颅内出血（ICH）AI检测工具。放射科报告由八个开源大语言模型和一个符合HIPAA的内部GPT-4o版本进行分析，使用一个单次多射击提示来评估是否存在ICH。1,726个例子被手动审查。比较了八个开源模型和共识与GPT-4o的性能特征。测试了三个理想的共识LLM集合来评估分诊工具的性能。

Result: 队列包括29,766对头部CT检查报告。最高AUC性能由llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o实现（AUC= 0.78）。llama3.3:70b的平均精度最高（AP=0.75 & 0.76）。llama3.3:70b具有最高的F1分数（0.81）和召回率（0.85），更高的精确度（0.78）、特异性（0.72）和MCC（0.57）。使用MCC（95% CI）的理想组合LLM是：Full-9 Ensemble 0.571（0.552-0.591），Top-3 Ensemble 0.558（0.537-0.579），Consensus 0.556（0.539-0.574），以及GPT4o 0.522（0.500-0.543）。Top-3、Full-9和Consensus之间没有统计学显著差异（p > 0.05）。

Conclusion: 一个由中型到大型开源大语言模型组成的集合提供了一种更一致和可靠的方法，以推导出临床AI分诊工具的地面真实回顾性评估，而不是单独使用一个大语言模型。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对CORE-KG进行了系统消融研究，以评估其两个关键组件的贡献。结果表明，去除指代消解和结构化提示会显著增加节点重复和噪声节点。这些发现为设计稳健的LLM管道提供了实证见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类人口贩卖网络日益适应性强且难以分析。法律案件文件提供了关键的见解，但通常是非结构化的、词汇密集的，并且充满了模糊或变化的参考，这对自动知识图谱（KG）构建构成了重大挑战。虽然基于LLM的方法比静态模板有所改进，但由于缺乏引导提取和指代消解，它们仍然生成嘈杂的、碎片化的图。

Method: 我们对CORE-KG进行了系统的消融研究，以量化其两个关键组件的单独贡献。

Result: 结果表明，去除指代消解会导致节点重复增加28.32%和噪声节点增加4.32%，而去除结构化提示会导致节点重复增加4.34%和噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计从复杂法律文本中提取结构化表示的稳健LLM管道提供了实证见解。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DIVRIT，一种新的希伯来语重音系统，它将任务视为零样本分类问题，利用视觉语言模型处理未重音文本，实现了高精度的重音恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语的重音恢复是确保准确发音和消除文本意义歧义的基本任务，尽管该语言在无重音状态下具有高度的模糊性，但最近的机器学习方法已显著提高了性能。

Method: DIVRIT将任务视为零样本分类问题，通过动态生成的候选集选择最合适的重音模式，并利用希伯来文视觉语言模型处理未重音文本作为图像，从而直接嵌入重音信息。

Result: 通过各种配置的全面评估，系统展示了在不依赖复杂的显式语言分析的情况下有效执行重音标记的能力，在“oracle”设置中，系统达到了很高的准确性。此外，战略性的架构增强和优化的训练方法显著提高了系统的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了视觉表示在准确和自动化希伯来语重音标记中的潜在前景。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了变压器语言模型中的线性关系解码器，发现它们主要基于属性而非特定关系，并且可以高度压缩而不损失解码准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们想要理解线性操作器如何解码特定的关系事实，并探索它们是否可以被压缩而不损失解码准确性。

Method: 我们扩展了Hernandez等人（2023）的单关系发现到一组关系，并系统地绘制了它们的组织结构。我们开发了一种交叉评估协议，将每个线性解码器算子应用于其他每个关系的主体。

Result: 我们发现这些关系解码器可以高度压缩而不会显著损失解码准确性。此外，这些线性映射并不编码不同的关系，而是提取重复的、粗粒度的语义属性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，线性关系解码在变压器语言模型中主要是基于属性的，而不是特定于关系的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度搜索场景中，代理需要付出大量的探索成本才能获得稀少且常常为零的最终奖励，这限制了RLVR的应用。因此，本文旨在解决奖励密度低的问题，以提高代理的性能。

Method: 本文提出了InfoFlow框架，从三个方面解决奖励密度优化问题：1) 子问题分解，将长距离任务分解为分配过程奖励，从而提供更密集的学习信号；2) 失败引导提示，向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导以增加成功可能性；3) 双代理精炼，使用双代理架构来卸载深度探索的认知负担。

Result: 本文提出的InfoFlow框架在多个代理搜索基准测试中显著优于强基线，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为InfoFlow的系统框架，以解决深度搜索场景中奖励密度低的问题。实验结果表明，InfoFlow在多个代理搜索基准测试中显著优于强基线，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3在使用动态树结构改进推测解码时，往往忽略了GPU设备和批量大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的动态树解码方法，称为CAST，它考虑了推理成本，包括GPU配置和批量大小等因素，以动态优化树结构。

Result: 通过在六个不同的任务和六个不同的LLM上进行全面的实验，我们的方法展示了显著的结果。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在六个不同的任务中表现出色，比传统的解码方法快5.2倍，并且通常优于现有的最先进的技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages.

Method: SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Conclusion: SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary and open-source models.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了编码器-解码器LLM（RedLLM），并将其与解码器-only LLM（DecLLM）进行了全面比较。实验结果表明，RedLLM在扩展性和性能方面表现出色，且在推理效率上更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近的大规模语言模型（LLM）研究从编码器-解码器建模转向了当前主导的解码器-only建模，但这种快速转变缺乏严格的比较分析，尤其是在扩展视角下，这引发了对编码器-解码器模型潜力可能被忽视的担忧。

Method: 我们重新审视了编码器-解码器LLM（RedLLM），并对其进行了改进，结合了最近的解码器-only LLM（DecLLM）的技巧。我们使用RedPajama V1（1.6T tokens）进行预训练，并使用FLAN进行指令调优，对不同模型规模的RedLLM和DecLLM进行了全面比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，RedLLM表现出有吸引力的扩展特性以及令人惊讶的强大性能。虽然DecLLM在预训练过程中总体上更计算优化，但RedLLM展示了相当的扩展性和上下文长度外推能力。经过指令调优后，RedLLM在各种下游任务中实现了相当甚至更好的结果，同时享受显著更好的推理效率。

Conclusion: 我们的研究希望激发更多对RedLLM的重新审视，从而释放其潜力，开发出强大且高效的LLM。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Evontree框架，该框架利用少量高质量的本体规则来系统地提取、验证和增强LLMs中的领域知识，无需大量外部数据集。实验结果表明，该方法在低资源领域适应性方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据敏感领域如医疗保健中，缺乏高质量的特定领域训练语料库阻碍了LLMs在专业应用中的适应。同时，领域专家已经将领域智慧归纳为本体规则，这些规则形式化了概念之间的关系并确保了知识管理存储库的完整性。

Method: Evontree框架利用少量高质量的本体规则系统地提取、验证和增强LLMs中的领域知识，而无需大量外部数据集。具体来说，Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致之处，并通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼的知识。

Result: 在医学问答基准测试中，使用Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2进行的广泛实验表明，我们的方法在准确性上比未修改的模型和领先的监督基线有持续的提升，最高提高了3.7%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在低资源领域适应性方面表现出有效性、效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms full attention in various scenarios, with improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to introduce a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across various scenarios, including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement learning scaling regimes.

Method: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that uses Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a finer-grained gating mechanism. It also uses a bespoke chunkwise algorithm with a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices.

Result: Kimi Linear outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding throughput for a 1M context.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco 是一种新型架构，能够实现真正的“端到端”生成，通过学习控制自己的解码策略。它在多个基准测试中表现出色，并展现出基于指令的解码控制能力，为可操控和交互式的 LLM 解码开辟了新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 LLM 解码过程依赖于非微分化的解码过程，需要手动调整超参数，如温度和 top-p。这种“端到端”的标签是误导性的，因此需要一种新的方法来实现真正的端到端生成。

Method: AutoDeco 通过在标准 transformer 上添加轻量级头部，在每一步动态预测上下文特定的温度和 top-p 值以及下一个标记的 logits，将解码转换为参数化、逐标记的过程，使模型能够在一次前向传递中自我调节其采样策略。

Result: AutoDeco 在八个基准测试中显著优于默认解码策略，并且实现了与基于“破解测试集”的最优静态方法相当的性能。此外，AutoDeco 展现出基于指令的解码控制能力，使模型能够根据自然语言命令调整其预测的温度和 top-p 值。

Conclusion: AutoDeco 是一种新型架构，能够实现真正的“端到端”生成，通过学习控制自己的解码策略。它在多个基准测试中表现出色，甚至可以与基于“破解测试集”的最优静态方法相媲美。此外，AutoDeco 还展现出基于指令的解码控制能力，使模型能够根据自然语言命令调整其预测的温度和 top-p 值，为可操控和交互式的 LLM 解码开辟了新范式。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了后训练过程中模型如何以及在哪个阶段实现价值对齐，发现SFT阶段通常建立模型的价值观，而后续的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会中扮演越来越重要的角色，它们越来越多地面临需要不仅依赖于一般知识，还要与某些人类价值观保持一致的问题。因此，研究LLM与人类价值观的一致性已成为一个关键的研究领域。然而，以往的工作主要集中在评估完全训练模型的一致性，忽略了模型学习表达人类价值观的训练动态。

Method: 我们分析了后训练算法和数据集的影响，测量了训练过程中的价值观漂移的程度和时间。我们还使用了一个合成偏好数据集，以控制方式操纵价值观，以研究不同偏好优化算法在相同偏好数据下的价值对齐结果。

Result: 我们发现SFT阶段通常建立模型的价值观，而后续的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。此外，使用合成偏好数据集，我们发现即使偏好数据保持不变，不同的偏好优化算法也会导致不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了关于后训练过程中价值观是如何被学习的实用见解，并有助于指导数据整理，以及选择用于偏好优化的模型和算法，以提高模型与人类价值观的一致性。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准测试，包含50个由人类精心设计的问题，旨在评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试已广泛用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的数学推理能力，但许多现有的数学竞赛由于性能饱和（例如AIME24/25）而不再有效。因此，需要更严格的挑战来评估顶级LLMs。

Method: AMO-Bench通过专家交叉验证确保问题达到国际数学奥林匹克竞赛（IMO）难度标准，并且所有问题都是原创的，以防止性能泄漏。此外，每个问题只需要最终答案，而不是证明，以便进行自动和稳健的评分。

Result: 在AMO-Bench上对26个LLMs的实验结果表明，即使表现最好的模型也仅达到52.4%的准确率，大多数LLMs的得分低于40%。此外，分析还揭示了随着测试时间计算量增加的有希望的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: AMO-Bench展示了当前大型语言模型在数学推理方面的显著提升空间，并通过释放该基准测试来促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的部署增加，需要自动设计具有挑战性的、代码库级别的评估。

Method: 提出Gistify任务，要求编码大语言模型创建一个单一、最小、自包含的文件来重现代码库的特定功能。

Result: 研究发现，当前最先进的模型难以可靠地解决Gistify任务，特别是执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的模型在解决Gistify任务方面存在困难，尤其是在执行轨迹较长的任务中。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的主观评估方法SP-MCQA，用于衡量TTS系统在关键信息准确性方面的表现，并发布了一个大型数据集。研究发现，现有指标无法全面反映真实世界的可理解性，需要更高级别的评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法主要依赖于词对词的准确度指标，如WER，这些指标无法捕捉现实世界语音的复杂性或反映人类的理解需求。

Method: 本文提出了Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering（SP-MCQA）方法，用于评估合成语音中的关键信息准确性，并发布了SP-MCQA-Eval数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，低WER并不一定保证高关键信息准确性，这暴露了传统指标与实际可理解性之间的差距。SP-MCQA还显示，即使最先进的模型在文本规范化和语音准确性方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 本文强调了当前TTS系统在真实世界可理解性方面的不足，指出需要更高层次、更贴近生活的评估标准。

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中的有效性，特别是在动态海洋环境下的水下目标检测。

Method: 首先评估了时间增强的YOLOv5变体T-YOLOv5的性能，并将其与标准YOLOv5进行比较。然后通过添加卷积块注意模块（CBAM）开发了T-YOLOv5的增强版本。

Result: YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5与CBAM的mAP@50-95分别为0.813和0.811，显示出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测的可靠性，而T-YOLOv5与CBAM的结合在复杂场景中进一步提升了性能，尽管在简单场景中会出现精度下降。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中的异常检测局限于工业缺陷或不现实的合成异常，未能捕捉真实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性。因此需要一个更真实的基准来评估VLMs在检测和理解异常方面的能力。

Method: 引入CAVE，这是第一个真实世界视觉异常的基准，支持三种开放任务：异常描述、解释和证明，并提供细粒度的注释以进行视觉定位和分类异常。

Result: 最先进的VLMs即使使用先进的提示策略，在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍然存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个真实且基于认知的基准，为推进VLMs中的异常检测和常识推理研究提供了宝贵的资源。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型（VLMs）在许多多模态任务中表现出色，但它们对视频中的时间信息的理解仍然薄弱且评估不足。

Method: 引入了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH，这是一个经过心理物理学验证的基准测试，用于测试VLMs能否使用与人类相同的刺激和行为基线来推断自然视频中的时间方向。

Result: 对开放权重和专有、推理和非推理VLMs进行全面评估显示，大多数模型的表现接近随机，即使最好的模型在物理不可逆过程和因果手动动作上的准确度也远低于人类。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然它们捕捉了丰富的视觉-语义相关性，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有的自改进方法在处理简单查询时表现优异，但在处理复杂查询时存在不足，导致优化不平衡，限制了模型的进一步提升。

Method: 本文从分布重塑和轨迹重采样两个角度引入了四种高效策略，以实现探索与学习自改进过程中的头尾再平衡。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上的广泛实验表明，本文的方法在视觉推理能力上有所提升，平均优于原始自改进方法3.86分。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在视觉推理任务中显著提升了模型性能，平均优于原始自改进方法3.86分。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Motivation: 研究视频模型是否能够在具有挑战性的视觉推理场景中作为零样本推理者使用。

Method: 我们对领先的视频生成模型Veo-3进行了实证研究，评估了其在12个维度上的推理行为，包括空间、几何、物理、时间以及具身逻辑。

Result: 当前视频模型在短期空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部一致动力学方面表现出有希望的推理模式，但在长期因果推理、严格的几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍存在限制。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型在作为独立的零样本推理者方面还不够可靠，但在与专门的推理模型结合时显示出有希望的迹象。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的冷启动框架SPECS，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，进行基于偏好的训练，专注于表面形式标准而非记忆内容，从而在多模态任务中实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数代表性范式从冷启动开始，通常采用监督微调（SFT）来初始化策略，但SFT-based冷启动采用了与任务解决方案和输出格式交织的推理范式，可能导致指令式过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并最终影响下游RL。我们重新审视冷启动的两个方面，其训练方法和数据构建，并引入了通用因子（GF）系数来量化不同方法下的泛化能力。

Method: 我们提出了SPECS-一个自蒸馏、基于偏好的冷启动框架，它解耦了多模态学习：(1)通过自蒸馏生成反思性偏好数据对，避免依赖更大的教师或手动注释；(2)进行基于偏好的训练，专注于浅层、可转移的表面形式标准（格式、结构、风格），而不是记忆内容；(3)将结果交给RL以获得可验证的奖励进行深度推理。

Result: 实验证明基于偏好的训练方法（如DPO）在冷启动中比基于SFT的方法表现更好。我们的解耦学习框架在多个多模态基准测试中表现出色，相对于强基线取得了持续的性能提升，提高了MEGA-Bench 4.1%和MathVista 12.2%。

Conclusion: 我们的解耦学习框架在多个多模态基准测试中表现出色，相对于强基线取得了持续的性能提升，提高了MEGA-Bench 4.1%和MathVista 12.2%。额外的实验表明，SPECS有助于减少分布内“卡住”，提高探索能力，稳定训练并提升性能上限。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何视角来理解Transformer模型中的参数记忆，发现模型能够合成全局关系的几何结构，这为理解模型的记忆机制提供了新的思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将参数记忆视为对实体共现关系的暴力查找，但这种方法无法解释模型如何处理非共现实体之间的全局关系。本文旨在探索一种更有效的几何视角来理解模型的记忆机制。

Method: 本文通过分析Transformer模型在序列建模中的表现，对比了传统的关联视图和几何视图，并结合Node2Vec的分析，揭示了几何结构的形成机制。

Result: 研究发现，尽管模型仅优化局部关联，但仍能学习到优雅的几何结构，这表明几何结构的出现并非仅仅由于架构或优化压力。此外，该几何结构可以为Transformer记忆提供更强的几何特性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个几何视角来理解Transformer模型中的参数记忆，认为模型能够合成自己的几何结构来编码全局关系，而不仅仅是局部共现关系。这种几何结构使得复杂的推理任务变得更容易学习。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

TL;DR: 本文指出，RL微调中的不稳定问题源于浮点精度本身，而不是算法或工程对齐。通过将精度从BF16改为FP16，可以解决这一问题，从而实现更稳定、更快和更强的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的RL微调方法在训练和推理策略之间存在数值不匹配的问题，这导致了不稳定。

Method: 通过将精度从BF16改为FP16，简单地解决了训练和推理策略之间的数值不匹配问题。

Result: 使用FP16可以消除这种不匹配，实现更稳定的优化，更快的收敛和更强的性能。

Conclusion: 使用FP16可以更稳定地优化，更快地收敛，并在各种任务、算法和框架中表现出更强的性能。我们希望这些发现能促使对RL微调中的精度权衡进行更广泛的重新考虑。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Method: 本文介绍了ORBIT，一个统一的基准测试框架，用于一致和现实的推荐模型评估，并引入了一个新的网页推荐任务ClueWeb-Reco。

Result: ORBIT基准测试结果显示了推荐系统在公共数据集上的普遍改进，但隐藏测试结果揭示了现有方法在大规模网页推荐中的局限性。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse.

Method: FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum: baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss, adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation.

Result: The DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1% macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to 14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms.

Conclusion: FakeZero can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of misinformation across social networks. With user consent, it also opens the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the wild.

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user

and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal

baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of

<details>

Motivation: LLM代理的规划和工具调用能力使其面临新的安全风险，因此需要一个全面的红队系统来发现漏洞并确保其安全部署。

Method: SIRAJ采用了一种动态的两步流程，首先生成覆盖各种风险结果、工具使用轨迹和风险源的种子测试用例，然后基于先前尝试的执行轨迹迭代构建和优化模型为基础的对抗攻击。此外，还提出了一种模型蒸馏方法，利用教师模型的结构化推理来训练更小但同样有效的模型。

Conclusion: SIRAJ框架能够有效提升LLM代理的安全性，通过生成多样化的测试用例和优化红队攻击成功率，验证了其在不同评估设置中的有效性。

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative

TL;DR: PVMark是一种基于零知识证明的水印检测方法，能够在不泄露密钥的情况下实现公开可验证性，有效解决了现有水印方案的信任问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前水印解决方案难以解决信任问题：水印检测无法公开证明其自身可靠执行。这是因为水印检测中使用的密钥通常是秘密的，这可能导致攻击者发起移除攻击；而如果密钥是私有的，水印检测对公众来说则是不透明的。

Method: PVMark基于零知识证明（ZKP），通过构建一系列ZKP约束（包括映射、随机数生成、比较和求和）来实现水印检测过程的公开可验证性。

Result: PVMark在Python、Rust和Circom中实现了多种变体，覆盖了三种水印方案、三种哈希函数和四种ZKP协议，实验结果表明该方法在各种情况下都能有效工作。

Conclusion: PVMark有效地实现了对最先进的LLM水印方案的公开可验证性，同时不损害水印性能，有望在实践中部署。

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地被用作评估任务的评分者。然而，它们在主观任务中的可靠性常常受到限制，当人类判断涉及超出注释标签的细微推理时。思维轨迹（判断背后的推理）是非常有信息量的，但难以收集和整理。

Method: 我们提出了一种人-LLM协作框架，从仅标签注释中推断思维轨迹。所提出的框架使用一种简单而有效的拒绝采样方法大规模重建这些轨迹。

Result: 我们的方法在多个数据集上显著提高了LLM与人类的一致性。此外，改进的注释指南增加了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，LLMs可以作为实际的代理，以揭示原本无法获得的人类思维轨迹，使仅标签的语料库扩展为增强LLM评分器可靠性的思维轨迹增强资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Motivation: 尽管强化学习可以在大型语言模型中激发强大的推理能力，但大多数公开工作集中在数学和代码上。需要一种更通用的推理方法。

Method: 提出了一种简单的两阶段课程，首先在预训练对齐的领域（如数学）中激发推理技能，然后通过联合强化学习在其他领域适应和优化这些技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B上进行的多领域套件评估显示，推理课程带来了稳定的提升。消融实验和认知技能分析表明，两个阶段都是必要的，并且数学优先的激发增加了解决复杂问题的重要认知行为。

Conclusion: 推理课程提供了一种紧凑且易于采用的通用推理方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在规范推理领域的能力，发现它们在逻辑一致性方面存在挑战，并显示出类似人类的认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种推理任务中表现出色，但它们在处理规范推理方面的能力仍缺乏深入研究。因此，本文旨在系统评估LLMs在规范领域的推理能力，并探讨其在逻辑和模态方面的表现。

Method: 本文从逻辑和模态角度系统评估了LLMs在规范领域中的推理能力。为了评估LLMs如何处理规范模态，我们比较了它们在规范模态和具有共同形式结构的认识模态方面的推理。为此，我们引入了一个新数据集，涵盖了规范和认识领域中的广泛形式推理模式，同时还结合了影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: 研究结果表明，尽管LLMs通常遵循有效的推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中表现出明显的不一致，并显示出与人类推理心理研究中观察到的认知偏差相似的偏差。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，尽管LLMs通常遵循有效的推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中表现出明显的不一致，并显示出与人类推理心理研究中观察到的认知偏差相似的偏差。这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，并为提高其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: AsyncThink is a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models that organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. It reduces inference latency and improves accuracy on mathematical reasoning, while also generalizing its learned capabilities to tackle unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence.

Method: We introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. We propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. The thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning.

Result: AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.

Conclusion: AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

TL;DR: Nexus is a multi-agent framework for test oracle generation that outperforms existing methods, improving accuracy and enhancing downstream tasks like bug detection and program repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge in software engineering, requiring accurate oracles to determine whether a function under test behaves as intended for a given input.

Method: Nexus is a multi-agent framework that generates test oracles by leveraging a diverse set of specialized agents. These agents collaborate in phases of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement to produce accurate oracles.

Result: Nexus improves the test-level oracle accuracy on LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. It also enhances the bug detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval from 90.91% to 95.45%, and the success rate of automated program repair from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Conclusion: Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in test oracle generation, significantly improving downstream tasks such as bug detection and automated program repair.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SecureReviewer的新方法，旨在增强LLM在代码审查中识别和解决安全相关问题的能力。通过构建一个专门用于训练和评估安全代码审查能力的数据集，并采用安全感知微调策略和RAG技术，以及引入新的评估指标SecureBLEU，实验结果表明SecureReviewer在多个方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开发生命周期的早期阶段识别和解决安全问题对于减轻对软件系统的长期负面影响至关重要。代码审查作为一种有效的实践，使开发人员能够在将代码集成到代码库之前检查队友的代码。为了简化审查评论的生成，已经提出了各种自动代码审查方法，其中基于LLM的方法显著提高了自动审查生成的能力。然而，现有模型主要关注通用代码审查，它们在识别和解决安全相关问题方面的有效性仍缺乏探索。此外，将现有的代码审查方法适应于针对安全问题面临重大挑战，包括数据稀缺和评估指标不足。

Method: 我们首先构建了一个针对训练和评估安全代码审查能力的数据集。利用这个数据集，我们微调LLM以生成能够有效识别安全问题并提供修复建议的代码审查评论，采用我们提出的安全感知微调策略。为了减轻LLM中的幻觉并提高其输出的可靠性，我们集成了RAG技术，将生成的评论扎根于特定领域的安全知识。此外，我们引入了SecureBLEU，这是一种新的评估指标，旨在评估审查评论在解决安全问题方面的有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SecureReviewer在安全问题检测准确性和生成的审查评论的整体质量和实用性方面都优于最先进的基线。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，SecureReviewer在安全问题检测准确性和生成的审查评论的整体质量和实用性方面都优于最先进的基线。

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 DySQL-Bench 基准，用于评估模型在动态用户交互下的性能，涵盖多个领域，具有较高的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到 SQL 系统在静态、单轮任务中表现良好，但在现实世界中交互场景下表现不足。用户意图会随着查询的迭代而变化，需要模型能够适应这种动态性。

Method: 引入 DySQL-Bench 基准，通过自动化两阶段流程生成任务，并进行交互导向的过滤和专家验证。此外，提出一个模拟真实交互的多轮评估框架，包括 LLM 模拟用户、待测模型和可执行数据库之间的互动。

Result: DySQL-Bench 覆盖了 BIRD 和 Spider 2 数据库中的 13 个领域，共 1,072 个任务。人类评估确认了合成数据的 100% 正确性。GPT-4o 在整体准确率和 Pass@5 指标上分别只有 58.34% 和 23.81%。

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench 提供了一个具有挑战性的基准，用于评估模型在动态用户交互下的性能。即使 GPT-4o 也仅达到 58.34% 的总体准确率和 23.81% 的 Pass@5 指标，表明该基准的难度较高。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are
released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .
