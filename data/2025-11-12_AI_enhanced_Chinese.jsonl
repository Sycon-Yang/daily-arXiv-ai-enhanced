However, few studies have examined RAG for Taiwanese Historical Archives. In this paper, we present an initial study of a RAG pipeline applied to two historical Traditional Chinese datasets, Fort Zeelandia and the Taiwan Provincial Council Gazette, along with their corresponding open-ended query sets. We systematically investigate the effects of query characteristics and metadata integration strategies on retrieval quality, answer generation, and the performance of the overall system. The results show that early-stage metadata integration enhances both retrieval and answer accuracy while also revealing persistent challenges for RAG systems, including hallucinations during generation and difficulties in handling temporal or multi-hop historical queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86RAG\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1RAG\u5df2\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86RAG\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u591a\u8df3\u5386\u53f2\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Unlike standard scientific reasoning or general creative generation, idea generation in science is a multi-objective and open-ended task, where the novelty of a contribution is as essential as its empirical soundness. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising generators of scientific ideas, capable of producing coherent and factual outputs with surprising intuition and acceptable reasoning, yet their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood. This survey provides a structured synthesis of methods for LLM-driven scientific ideation, examining how different approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness. We categorize existing methods into five complementary families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. To interpret their contributions, we employ two complementary frameworks: Boden's taxonomy of Combinatorial, Exploratory and Transformational creativity to characterize the level of ideas each family expected to generate, and Rhodes' 4Ps framework-Person, Process, Press, and Product-to locate the aspect or source of creativity that each method emphasizes.

However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGRIP\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u5316\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6216\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GRIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5316\u590d\u6742\u7684\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5404\u79cd\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our system combines a terminology-aware NMT model, adapted via fine-tuning on large-scale synthetic data, with a prompt-based LLM for post-editing.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens. These optimizations make LLM-based reranking substantially more efficient and feasible for latency-sensitive, real-world deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.

We simulate these gaps with an open-ended narrative cloze task: asking LLMs to generate a masked event in a character-centric timeline sourced from a novel corpus of unpublished texts. We evaluate audited (for data contamination), fully-open models (the OLMo-2 family) and unaudited open-weight and proprietary baselines under a range of prompts designed to elicit controlled and useful hallucinations.

The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u5728\u8bcd\u8bed\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u89c4\u5212\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u53e5\u5b50\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u540e\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u548c\u8fc7\u53bb\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u89c4\u5212\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u8bcd\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u67b6\u8d77\u4e86\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

Adhering to the principles of \"quantitative-oriented, expert-driven, and multi-validation,\" the benchmark establishes an evaluation framework covering 5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, and 14,430 high-quality questions, encompassing insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor. Based on this benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 11 mainstream large language models. The evaluation results reveal that general-purpose models suffer from common bottlenecks such as weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation. High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection.

A promising approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents is to better utilize prior experiences in guiding current decisions. However, LLMs acquire experience either through implicit memory via training, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability, or explicit memory via prompting, which lacks adaptability. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework and evaluate how context memory enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize parametric information. The graph abstracts raw agent trajectories into structured decision paths in a state machine and further distills them into high-level, human-interpretable strategic meta-cognition. In order to make memory adaptable, we propose a reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure that estimates the empirical utility of each meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. These optimized strategies are then dynamically integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting. Empirically, the learnable graph memory delivers robust generalization, improves LLM agents' strategic reasoning performance, and provides consistent benefits during Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u7ecf\u9a8c\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff08\u9690\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff08\u663e\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5f53\u524d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u5230LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u56fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002"}}

Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment. All datasets, models, and tools are available at github and huggingface to support transparent and socially responsible research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86AlignSurvey\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u793e\u4f1a\u8c03\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u652f\u6301AlignSurvey\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u90fd\u53ef\u5728GitHub\u548cHuggingFace\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u900f\u660e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u67e5\u9762\u4e34\u56fa\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u683c\u5f0f\u3001\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6709\u9650\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u8c03\u67e5\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u8c03\u67e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u8fb9\u7f18\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f15\u5165AlignSurvey\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u793e\u4f1a\u8c03\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AlignSurvey\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u8c03\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ecSocial Foundation Corpus\u548cEntire-Pipeline Survey Datasets\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AlignSurvey\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u793e\u4f1a\u8c03\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u652f\u6301AlignSurvey\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u90fd\u53ef\u5728GitHub\u548cHuggingFace\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u900f\u660e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86AlignSurvey\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u793e\u4f1a\u8c03\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u652f\u6301AlignSurvey\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u90fd\u53ef\u5728GitHub\u548cHuggingFace\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u900f\u660e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format.

We argue that this challenge can be resolved by modeling the distribution of clean samples in the encoder embedding manifold. To this end, we propose the Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), a two-module system that operates directly on sentence embeddings. A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation. We conducted extensive evaluations on text classification (TC) across three datasets and multiple adversarial attacks.

However, the representational differences between unstructured and structured knowledge make LLMs inherently struggle to maintain logic consistency, leading to \\textit{Logic Drift} challenges in structured knowledge reasoning tasks such as Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Existing methods address this limitation by designing complex workflows embedded in prompts to guide LLM reasoning. Nevertheless, these approaches only provide input-level guidance and fail to fundamentally address the \\textit{Logic Drift} in LLM outputs. Additionally, their inflexible reasoning workflows cannot adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs. To enhance LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning, we specifically target the logits output from the autoregressive generation process. We propose the \\textit{Logits-to-Logic} framework, which incorporates logits strengthening and logits filtering as core modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs.

With social media, people can freely communicate and share their thoughts, ask personal questions, and seek peer-support, especially those with conditions that are highly stigmatized, without revealing personal identity. We study the state-of-the-art research methodologies and findings on mental health challenges like de- pression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, from the pervasive use of social media data. We also discuss how these novel thinking and approaches can help to raise awareness of mental health issues in an unprecedented way.

Among these, theta-band synchrony has been closely associated with language processing, attentional control, and inner speech. However, previous studies have largely focused on a single mode, such as overt speech, and have rarely conducted an integrated comparison of theta synchrony across different speech modes. In this study, we analyzed differences in theta-band neural synchrony across speech modes based on connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations. The results revealed that overt and whispered speech exhibited broader and stronger frontotemporal synchrony, reflecting active motor-phonological coupling during overt articulation, whereas perceived speech showed dominant posterior and temporal synchrony patterns, consistent with auditory perception and comprehension processes. In contrast, imagined speech demonstrated a more spatially confined but internally coherent synchronization pattern, primarily involving frontal and supplementary motor regions. These findings indicate that the extent and spatial distribution of theta synchrony differ substantially across modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying predominantly on temporoparietal networks. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the differences in theta-band neural synchrony across various speech modes, thereby uncovering both the shared and distinct neural dynamics underlying language perception and imagined speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0btheta\u6ce2\u6bb5\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51fa\u58f0\u548c\u8033\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u989d\u989e\u540c\u6b65\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u611f\u77e5\u8a00\u8bed\u4e3b\u8981\u6d89\u53ca\u540e\u90e8\u548c\u989e\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u60f3\u8c61\u8a00\u8bed\u5219\u4e3b\u8981\u6d89\u53ca\u989d\u53f6\u548c\u8865\u5145\u8fd0\u52a8\u533a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u51fa\u58f0\u8a00\u8bed\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684theta\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0btheta\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0btheta\u6ce2\u6bb5\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u51fa\u58f0\u548c\u8033\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u989d\u989e\u540c\u6b65\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u611f\u77e5\u8a00\u8bed\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u540e\u90e8\u548c\u989e\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u60f3\u8c61\u8a00\u8bed\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9610\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0btheta\u6ce2\u6bb5\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u60f3\u8c61\u8bed\u97f3\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNOTAM-Evolve\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347NOTAM\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u60c5\u62a5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u91caNOTAM\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNOTAM-Evolve\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u63a5\u5730\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u4ece\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "NOTAM-Evolve\u572810,000\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684NOTAM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840LLM\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8630.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "NOTAM-Evolve\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316NOTAM\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840LLM\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8630.4%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Submitted to the LREC 2026 conference", "summary": "Until recently, fine-tuned BERT-like models provided state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks. With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets.

Existing methods either use one shared parameterized module across all roles or assign a separate parameterized module to each role. However, the role-shared module may ignore distinct traits of each role, weakening personality learning, while the role-specific module may overlook shared traits across multiple roles, hindering commonality modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel HyCoRA: Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive learning framework, which efficiently improves multi-character role-playing ability by balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. Specifically, we propose a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, where one half is a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network, and the other half is a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module is devised to represent distinct persona signatures, while the role-shared module serves to capture common traits. Moreover, to better reflect distinct personalities across different roles, we design a hyper-contrastive learning mechanism to help the hyper-network distinguish their unique characteristics. Extensive experimental results on both English and Chinese available benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Further GPT-4 evaluations and visual analyses also verify the capability of HyCoRA to capture role characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684HyCoRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u89d2\u8272\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u914d\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHyCoRA\u7684\u8d85\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89d2\u8272\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u534a\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u534a\u662f\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u6587\u548c\u4e2d\u6587\u53ef\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684GPT-4\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HyCoRA\u6355\u6349\u89d2\u8272\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HyCoRA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u89d2\u8272\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5171\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models.

Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions.

As neural networks acquire increasingly complex skills during their pretraining, it is not clear how successfully they can compose them. In this paper, we focus on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), and study their ability to compose skills across modalities. To this end, we design three evaluation tasks which can be solved sequentially composing two modality-dependent skills, and evaluate several open MLLMs under two main settings: i) prompting the model to directly solve the task, and ii) using a two-step cascaded inference approach, which manually enforces the composition of the two skills for a given task. Even with these straightforward compositions, we find that all evaluated MLLMs exhibit a significant cross-modality skill composition gap. To mitigate the aforementioned gap, we explore two alternatives: i) use chain-of-thought prompting to explicitly instruct MLLMs for skill composition and ii) a specific fine-tuning recipe to promote skill composition. Although those strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit significant skill composition gaps, suggesting that more research is needed to improve cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86MLLM\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684MLLM\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76MLLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u968f\u7740\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u5426\u6210\u529f\u5730\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u7ec4\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u5f00\u653e\u7684MLLM\uff1ai) \u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cii) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u7ea7\u8054\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u5f3a\u5236\u7ec4\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684MLLM\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u6539\u8fdbMLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

The aim is to determine how these features are encoded in the models' architecture, how they may differ from humans, and whether the results are affected by the type of model and language under investigation. We find that there are clear differences between humans and MLLMs with respect to these features across various tasks that tap into the representation of quantification in vivo vs. in silico.

It is an open question whether this architectural bias leads to degraded performance for languages that are structurally different from English. We examine one specific architectural choice: positional encodings, through the lens of the trade-off hypothesis: the supposed interplay between morphological complexity and word order flexibility. This hypothesis posits a trade-off between the two: a more morphologically complex language can have a more flexible word order, and vice-versa. Positional encodings are a direct target to investigate the implications of this hypothesis in relation to language modelling.

However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted \"extract entities then predict relations\" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLM-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores.

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9690\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u5bf9\u7537\u5973\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u53ea\u6709GPT\u548cLlama\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u663e\u6027\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6559\u5e08\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u6559\u5b66\u76ee\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528600\u7bc7\u6765\u81eaAES 2.0\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u751f\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff1a(i) \u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\u6027\u522b\u5316\u672f\u8bed\u7684\u9690\u542b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c(ii) \u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5316\u4f5c\u8005\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u7ef4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9690\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u5bf9\u7537\u5973\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u6bd4\u5973\u7537\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u53ea\u6709GPT\u548cLlama\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u663e\u6027\u6027\u522b\u7ebf\u7d22\u654f\u611f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

We explore the evolution of NLIDBs from early rule-based systems to advanced neural network-driven approaches. Drawing inspiration from the medical diagnostic process, we propose a novel framework integrating an error correction mechanism that diagnoses error types, identifies their causes, provides fixing instructions, and applies these corrections to SQL queries. This approach is further enriched by embedding fine-tuning and RAG, which harnesses external knowledge bases for improved accuracy and transparency.

Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models.

Specifically, we explore whether VLLMs can infer the hierarchical structure of tables without additional processing. As a basis for our experiments we use the PubTables-1M dataset, a large-scale corpus of scientific tables. From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task.

To address these limitations, we propose ReViewGraph (Reviewer-Author Debates Graph Reasoner), a novel framework that performs heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated multi-round reviewer-author debates. In our approach, reviewer-author exchanges are simulated through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Diverse opinion relations (e.g., acceptance, rejection, clarification, and compromise) are then explicitly extracted and encoded as typed edges within a heterogeneous interaction graph. By applying graph neural networks to reason over these structured debate graphs, ReViewGraph captures fine-grained argumentative dynamics and enables more informed review decisions.

However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response.

Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b AgentPRM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 LLM \u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5e8f\u5217\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a AgentPRM \u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\uff08TD-based\uff09\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08GAE\uff09\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAgentPRM \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa 8 \u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentPRM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards.

In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information. Our strategies achieve an average relative performance improvement of 56\\% under shortcut scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5feb\u6377\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8632%\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5feb\u6377\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534756%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5feb\u6377\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries.

The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer.

Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86CoT monitorability\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoME\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u4ee5\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8868\u8fbe\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u6216\u4e0d\u591f\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u800c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6b3a\u9a97\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u5c55\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\uff1a(i) verbalization\uff08LRMs\u5728CoT\u4e2d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u8868\u8fbe\u6307\u5bfc\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca(ii) monitor reliability\uff08CoT-based monitor\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540cCoT\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8everbalization\u8d28\u91cf\u3001monitor reliability\u548cLLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cCoT\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoME\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dLLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u5176CoT\u76d1\u63a7\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u652f\u6491\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models. Together, these analyses provide a systematic view of how persona conditioning shapes moral behavior in large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u6539\u53d8\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9053\u5fb7\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u5377\uff08MFQ\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u6ca1\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002Claude\u5bb6\u65cf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662fGemini\u548cGPT-4\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u95f4\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u6709\u660e\u663e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6613\u611f\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u8054\u5728\u5bb6\u65cf\u5c42\u9762\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8865\u5145\u3002", "motivation": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u6743\u8bbf\u95ee\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff081\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\uff082\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\uff083\uff09\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u4e07\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e trivial \u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6cdb\u5316\u90e8\u5206\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u6743\u8bbf\u95ee\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation. By combining bidirectional attention with the adaptive generation order, the approach models inter-item and intra-item dependencies more effectively and alleviates error accumulation. Specifically, our approach comprises three key designs: (1) a parallel tokenization scheme that produces semantic IDs for bidirectional modeling, addressing the mismatch between residual quantization and bidirectional architectures; (2) two masking mechanisms at the user-history and next-item levels to capture both inter-item sequential dependencies and intra-item semantic relationships; and (3) an adapted beam search strategy for adaptive-order discrete diffusion decoding, resolving the incompatibility of standard beam search with diffusion-based generation. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that LLaDA-Rec consistently outperforms both ID-based and state-of-the-art generative recommenders, establishing discrete diffusion as a new paradigm for generative recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLaDA-Rec\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5185\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5355\u5411\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u53ea\u80fd\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u524d\u9a71\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u4ece\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u540e\u7eed\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LLaDA-Rec\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u8350\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5e76\u884c\u8bed\u4e49ID\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u9879\u95f4\u548c\u9879\u5185\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5e76\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9879\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "LLaDA-Rec\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a consistently \u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eID\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u5668\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaDA-Rec\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper argues that such confident fabrication, what I call the polite liar, is a structural consequence of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Building on Frankfurt's analysis of bullshit as communicative indifference to truth, I show that this pathology is not deception but structural indifference: a reward architecture that optimizes for perceived sincerity over evidential accuracy. Current alignment methods reward models for being helpful, harmless, and polite, but not for being epistemically grounded. As a result, systems learn to maximize user satisfaction rather than truth, performing conversational fluency as a virtue.

There is a great need for a decentralized RAG system that enables foundation models to utilize information directly from data owners who maintain full control over their sources. However, decentralization brings a challenge: the numerous independent data sources vary significantly in reliability, which can diminish retrieval accuracy and response quality. To address this, our decentralized RAG system has a novel reliability scoring mechanism that dynamically evaluates each source based on the quality of responses it contributes to generate and prioritizes high-quality sources during retrieval. To ensure transparency and trust, the scoring process is securely managed through blockchain-based smart contracts, creating verifiable and tamper-proof reliability records without relying on a central authority. We evaluate our decentralized system with two Llama models (3B and 8B) in two simulated environments where six data sources have different levels of reliability. Our system achieves a +10.7\\% performance improvement over its centralized counterpart in the real world-like unreliable data environments. Notably, it approaches the upper-bound performance of centralized systems under ideally reliable data environments.

Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Orion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\u3002", "method": "Orion\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5956\u52b1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u56de\u6eaf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5728RL\u671f\u95f4\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u4e863%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u76841.2B\u6a21\u578b\u5728SciFact\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8677.6%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u566872.6%\uff09\uff0c\u5728BRIGHT\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8625.2%\uff08\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u768422.1%\uff09\uff0c\u5728NFCorpus\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8663.2%\uff08\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u768457.8%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728FEVER\u3001HotpotQA\u548cMSMarco\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u89c4\u6a21\u662f\u5b83\u4eec\u7684200-400\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\u65f6\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6765\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment.\n  Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation.\n  We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM watsonx.ai, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks.

It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information.

Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how.

These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility.

Each citation context is labeled with one of three reproducibility-oriented sentiment labels: Positive, Negative, or Neutral, reflecting the cited paper's perceived reproducibility or replicability.

Therefore, we propose LoopLLM, an energy-latency attack framework based on the observation that repetitive generation can trigger low-entropy decoding loops, reliably compelling LLMs to generate until their output limits.

Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%.

In speech synthesis, this is particularly pronounced due to the lack of a large-scale human preference dataset, which hinders the development of models that truly align with human perception. To address this, we introduce SpeechJudge, a comprehensive suite comprising a dataset, a benchmark, and a reward model centered on naturalness--one of the most fundamental subjective metrics for speech synthesis. First, we present SpeechJudge-Data, a large-scale human feedback corpus of 99K speech pairs. The dataset is constructed using a diverse set of advanced zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models across diverse speech styles and multiple languages, with human annotations for both intelligibility and naturalness preference. From this, we establish SpeechJudge-Eval, a challenging benchmark for speech naturalness judgment. Our evaluation reveals that existing metrics and AudioLLMs struggle with this task; the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves less than 70% agreement with human judgment, highlighting a significant gap for improvement. To bridge this gap, we develop SpeechJudge-GRM, a generative reward model (GRM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni-7B. It is trained on SpeechJudge-Data via a two-stage post-training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought rationales followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with GRPO on challenging cases. On the SpeechJudge-Eval benchmark, the proposed SpeechJudge-GRM demonstrates superior performance, achieving 77.2% accuracy (and 79.4% after inference-time scaling @10) compared to a classic Bradley-Terry reward model (72.7%).

However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Hard-negative mining typically relies on ranking documents using cross-encoders or static embedding models based on similarity metrics such as cosine distance. Hard negative mining becomes challenging for biomedical and scientific domains due to the difficulty in distinguishing between source and hard negative documents. However, referenced documents naturally share contextual relevance with the source document but are not duplicates, making them well-suited as hard negatives. In this work, we propose BiCA: Biomedical Dense Retrieval with Citation-Aware Hard Negatives, an approach for hard-negative mining by utilizing citation links in 20,000 PubMed articles for improving a domain-specific small dense retriever. We fine-tune the GTE_small and GTE_Base models using these citation-informed negatives and observe consistent improvements in zero-shot dense retrieval using nDCG@10 for both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks on BEIR and outperform baselines on long-tailed topics in LoTTE using Success@5. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging document link structure to generate highly informative negatives, enabling state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning and demonstrating a path towards highly data-efficient domain adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5f15\u7528\u94fe\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03GTE_small\u548cGTE_Base\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6e90\u6587\u6863\u548c\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u53d8\u5f97\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u7528\u6587\u6863\u81ea\u7136\u4e0e\u6e90\u6587\u6863\u5177\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f46\u4e0d\u662f\u91cd\u590d\u9879\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BiCA\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u752820,000\u7bc7PubMed\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u94fe\u63a5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9GTE_small\u548cGTE_Base\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5728BEIR\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728LoTTE\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528Success@5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5728BEIR\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728LoTTE\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528Success@5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u94fe\u63a5\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u5f80\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity.

Without fine-tuning, pruning 50% of decoder self-attention reduces WER by 2.38% absolute (20.44% relative) on LibriSpeech test-other; pruning the last four encoder layers at 50% instead yields a 1.72% absolute (14.8% relative) improvement.

Experiments on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other show that dynamic int8 quantization with Quanto offers the best trade-off, reducing model size by 57% while improving on the baseline's word error rate.

However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness.

SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains.

These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries.

By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.\n  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning.\n  We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728NLP\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800c\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u7684MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u524d\u56db\u4e2aepoch\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8624.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u7eaf\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u768421.6%\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684NLP\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We conduct extensive experiments on different self-supervised and supervised models across various speech tasks, including ASR and paralinguistic analysis, and demonstrate that our method outperforms prior fusion approaches.

By releasing OASIS and its simulation environment, we provide a principled foundation for probing and strengthening agent safety in these overlooked dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OASIS\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u968f\u610f\u56fe\u6a21\u7cca\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u4ee5\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u5371\u5bb3\u4e0a\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u88ab\u9690\u85cf\u6216\u7a00\u91ca\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86OASIS\uff08\u6b63\u4ea4\u4ee3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u67e5\u8be2\u5957\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u6c99\u7bb1\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5f53\u610f\u56fe\u53d8\u5f97\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f1a\u6025\u5267\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u51fa\u73b0\u201c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6096\u8bba\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f3c\u4e4e\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u53d1\u5e03OASIS\u53ca\u5176\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
