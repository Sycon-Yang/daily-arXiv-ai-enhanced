### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于Transformer的模型DeBERTa-KC，用于自动分类在线科学学习话语中的知识建构水平。通过从YouTube科学频道收集的数据，构建了一个平衡的语料库，并在该模型上实现了优越的性能。研究结果表明，大型语言模型可以有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中的知识建构指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构细微指标的自动化方法，从而提供可扩展的理论依据的解决方案。

Method: 该研究提出了DeBERTa-KC，这是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习话语中的知识建构（KC）水平。通过从四个受欢迎的YouTube科学频道收集评论，创建了一个包含20,000个手动标注样本的平衡语料库，涵盖四个KC类别：非KC、分享、探索和协商。所提出的模型在DeBERTa-v3上进行了扩展，加入了焦点损失、标签平滑和R-Drop正则化以解决类别不平衡并提高泛化能力。实现了一个可重复的端到端流程，包括数据提取、注释、预处理、训练和评估。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC达到了0.836±0.008的宏F1分数，显著优于经典和Transformer基线（p<0.01）。按类别结果表明，对高阶认识论参与具有很强的敏感性，特别是在探索和协商话语中。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型可以有效地捕捉非正式数字学习环境中的知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和开发评估认知参与度的自动化工具提供了可扩展的、有理论依据的方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五种大型语言模型生成的教案，发现模型选择影响可读性，而提示框架影响事实准确性和课程一致性。最有效的配置是结合可读性优化的模型与RACE框架和显式检查表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在评估AI生成教案的教育合理性和可用性，以确定最佳的模型和提示框架组合，从而提高教学质量和课程一致性。

Method: 本研究评估了五种领先的大型语言模型生成的教案的教育合理性和可用性，并测试了三种结构化提示框架：TAG（任务、受众、目标）、RACE（角色、受众、情境、执行）和COSTAR（情境、目标、风格、语气、受众、回应格式）。通过四个自动计算指标分析了十五个针对高中物理主题“电磁波谱”的教案：（1）可读性和语言复杂性，（2）事实准确性和幻觉检测，（3）标准和课程一致性，（4）学习目标的认知需求。

Result: 结果显示，模型选择对语言可及性影响最大，DeepSeek生成的教案最具可读性（FKGL = 8.64），Claude生成的教案语言最密集（FKGL = 19.89）。提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响最大，RACE框架产生了最低的幻觉指数并最高程度地符合NGSS课程标准。所有模型的教案学习目标集中在Bloom分类法的“记忆”和“理解”层次，高阶动词较少。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程一致性更多取决于提示框架。最有效的配置是将可读性优化的模型与RACE框架以及物理概念、课程标准和高阶目标的显式检查表结合使用。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff通过主动修正机制解决了离散扩散模型中的训练-推理差异问题，显著提升了生成内容的质量和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离散扩散模型在实际应用中由于训练-推理差异导致的灾难性误差级联问题，从而提高生成内容的质量。

Method: ReDiff是一种增强修正的扩散框架，通过两阶段训练过程：首先，训练模型修正合成错误；其次，实现一种新颖的在线自我纠正循环，使模型通过专家纠正学习修正自己的错误 drafts。

Result: ReDiff在生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性方面有显著提升，实现了比传统去噪方法更优的稳定和高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，使并行生成更加稳定和高效，优于传统的去噪方法。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本以确定患者是否适合进一步HIV检测的新管道，并在临床数据上取得了高准确率和低假阴性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效筛查和早期诊断HIV对于减少传播至关重要。尽管大规模实验室测试不可行，但电子健康记录的广泛采用提供了新的机会。现有的研究主要集中在应用机器学习方法对结构化数据进行改进，但这些方法常常忽略了临床笔记等非结构化文本数据，这些数据可能包含与HIV风险相关的重要信息。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的管道，利用大型语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本以确定患者是否适合进一步的HIV检测。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的管道在埃因霍温大学医学中心的临床数据上取得了高准确率并保持了低假阴性率。

Conclusion: 我们的管道在临床数据上表现出高准确率并保持了低假阴性率。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了11个通用大语言模型（LLMs）在22个生命周期评估（LCA）相关任务中的表现，并由17位经验丰富的从业者对模型输出进行审查。结果显示，37%的回答包含不准确或误导性信息，而模型在解释质量和格式遵循性方面表现较好。开放权重模型在某些标准上表现优于封闭权重模型。研究强调了在LCA中使用LLMs的潜在风险和好处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能（AI），特别是大型语言模型（LLMs），正被越来越多地探索作为支持生命周期评估（LCA）的工具。虽然在环境和社会领域都有演示，但关于其可靠性、稳健性和可用性的系统证据仍然有限。本研究提供了第一个基于专家的LLMs在LCA中的基准测试，解决了该领域缺乏标准化评估框架的问题，因为在该领域中没有明确的地面真相或共识协议。

Method: 我们评估了十一个通用LLMs，涵盖商业和开源家族，在22个与LCA相关的任务中进行评估。十七位经验丰富的从业者根据与LCA实践直接相关的标准对模型输出进行了审查，包括科学准确性、解释质量、稳健性、可验证性和对指令的遵守情况。我们收集了168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判断37%的回答包含不准确或误导性信息。许多模型的准确性和解释质量评分通常为平均或良好，即使是较小的模型，格式遵循性也通常被评为有利。幻觉率差异显著，一些模型产生幻觉引用的比率高达40%。在开放权重和封闭权重LLMs之间的评分上没有明显的区别，开放权重模型在准确性、解释质量等标准上表现优于或与封闭权重模型相当。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LCA中天真地应用LLMs的风险，例如当LLMs被视为自由形式的预言时，同时也显示了好处，尤其是在解释质量和减轻简单任务的劳动密集性方面。在没有接地机制的情况下使用通用LLMs存在...

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出通过Dixit游戏评估多模态大语言模型的能力，结果显示该方法有效且能揭示模型与人类策略的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法存在主观性强、成本高以及模型可能利用表面技巧提高胜率的问题，因此需要一种更全面和客观的评估方式。

Method: 提出基于游戏的评估方法，具体通过Dixit这一幻想卡牌游戏来评估多模态大语言模型的能力。

Result: 实验表明，Dixit游戏的胜率排名与主流多模态大语言模型基准测试结果完美相关，同时揭示了模型与人类策略之间的差异。

Conclusion: 通过Dixit游戏评估，可以有效地衡量多模态大语言模型的能力，并揭示模型与人类策略之间的差异。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在运筹学（OR）中的应用潜力，特别是DeepSeek-R1模型在自然语言理解和代码生成方面的表现。研究评估了该模型在四个关键OR基准测试中的效果，并提出了减少幻觉和提高公式准确性的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专业知识将现实问题转化为可解决的数学模型，而大型语言模型（LLMs）可以利用自然语言理解和代码生成来弥合这一建模差距。然而，先前的模型如GPT-4、Claude和Bard在供应链环境中存在高令牌成本和幻觉倾向的问题，因此需要寻找一种更经济高效的替代方案。

Method: 本研究采用了基线评估、幻觉分类法的开发以及应用缓解策略如LLM-as-a-Judge、少样本学习（FSL）、工具调用和多代理框架的方法。这些技术旨在减少幻觉，提高公式准确性，并更好地使模型输出与用户意图对齐。

Result: 本研究评估了DeepSeek-R1在四个关键运筹学基准测试中的表现，发现其在LiveCodeBench和Math-500等基准测试中表现出色，但在实际运筹学场景中的有效性仍需进一步探索。

Conclusion: 本研究系统评估了DeepSeek-R1在四个关键运筹学基准测试中的表现，包括NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR。研究结果表明，尽管DeepSeek-R1在基准测试中表现出色，但在实际运筹学场景中的有效性仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于记忆的框架，利用标记数据和LLM生成的批评来提高目标分类的准确性，并揭示了不同模型在处理不同类型数据时的行为差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如微调通常成本高、不灵活且不透明，因此我们寻求一种更有效的方法来让基于预训练大语言模型的代理从标记示例中学习目标分类函数，而无需参数更新。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于记忆的框架，利用标记数据和LLM生成的批评。该框架使用情景记忆存储实例级批评，并使用语义记忆将这些批评提炼为可重用的任务级指导。

Result: 在各种任务中，结合批评的框架相比仅依赖标签的检索基础（RAG风格）基线，准确率提高了高达24.8%。此外，我们发现OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向和偏好数据方面存在显著的行为差异。

Conclusion: 我们的研究突显了基于记忆的、反思性学习在构建更适应和可解释的LLM代理方面的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

TL;DR: LyriCAR is a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that operates in a fully unsupervised manner. It introduces a difficulty-aware curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy to ensure efficient allocation of training resources, accelerate convergence, and improve overall translation quality. Experiments show that LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results while reducing training steps by nearly 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for lyric translation often rely on hand-crafted rules and sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize musical-linguistic patterns and generalize effectively at the paragraph level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial.

Method: LyriCAR is a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that operates in a fully unsupervised manner. It introduces a difficulty-aware curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy to ensure efficient allocation of training resources, accelerate convergence, and improve overall translation quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines. The adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40% while maintaining superior performance.

Conclusion: LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines. The adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40% while maintaining superior performance.

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合方法，结合大型语言模型的广泛覆盖语言处理能力和符号化自然语言理解生成结构化关系表示的能力，实验结果显示该方法在特定任务上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs具有广泛的应用性，但其依赖概率推理使其容易产生错误，如生成事实的幻觉和自然语言理解任务中输出结构不一致。而符号化NLU系统提供了基于精心策划的词典、语义资源和句法及语义解释规则的可解释理解，能够用于准确推理和规划以及可增量调试的学习。然而，符号化NLU系统在覆盖范围上较为有限，并需要稀缺的知识表示和语言学技能来扩展和维护。因此，本文旨在探索一种结合两者优势的混合方法。

Method: 本文采用混合方法，利用LLMs进行重写和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，并作为填补知识缺口的自动信息来源；同时使用符号化NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的表示。

Result: 本文在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果定律的任务上评估了混合方法，结果表明该方法显著优于仅使用符号化的方法。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了一种将大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛覆盖语言处理能力与符号化自然语言理解（NLU）生成结构化关系表示的能力相结合的混合方法，结果表明该方法在提取和解释常识科学文本中的数量和因果定律任务上显著优于仅使用符号化的方法。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在提出一种更符合人类大脑解析特性的自然语言解析算法。

Method: 该算法一次处理一个词，一旦可以附加就将每个词附加到解析树中。

Result: 该算法的最坏情况复杂度为$O(n^3)$，但在人类语言中，最坏情况仅在小$n$时发生。

Conclusion: 该算法为自然语言句子解析成依存树提供了一种基础方法，与人类大脑中的解析特性相符。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

Motivation: 许多医学数据集（如MedQA）依赖于简化的问答，这不能代表现实世界的临床决策。因此，我们需要一个更全面的范式来评估LLM在临床环境中的表现。

Method: 我们提出了一个统一的范式，将临床决策任务沿着两个维度进行表征：临床背景和临床问题。我们总结了现有数据集和基准的设置，并回顾了处理临床决策的方法，包括训练时间和测试时间技术，并总结了它们何时有帮助。

Result: 我们扩展了评估范围，不仅包括准确性，还包括效率和可解释性。我们还指出了开放性的挑战。

Conclusion: 我们的范式澄清了假设，标准化了比较，并指导了具有临床意义的LLM的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了针对希腊语的新型Transformer模型，通过高质量的数据集和多种现代架构，提高了在法律等高价值领域中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于希腊语等形态丰富的中等资源语言在自然语言处理方面的研究环境碎片化，缺乏架构多样性，且依赖于有限上下文长度的模型，特别是在法律等高价值领域，现有模型通常受限于早期的Transformer架构，无法处理长法律文档。

Method: 本文构建了多个大规模希腊语语料库，并采用严格的质量筛选和预处理方法，从通用领域和专业法律来源中创建高质量的训练数据集。在此基础上，预训练并系统评估了一系列现代架构，如ELECTRA、ConvBERT和ModernBERT，并提出了第一个针对法律领域的双语希腊语-英语嵌入模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，新类别的模型有效验证了所提出方法的可行性，GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型在下游任务中表现优异，显著超越现有基线。

Conclusion: 本文提出的新型模型在下游任务中表现出色，证明了所提出方法的有效性，特别是GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文旨在提高序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果，通过适应预训练神经语言模型来实现更好的性能。

Method: 论文提出了三种改进迁移学习的方法：引入多任务模型以结合额外信号；基于自回归大语言模型的架构修改方法；以及利用监督上下文微调和响应导向适应策略的自回归大语言模型序列标注框架。

Result: 论文提出的模型、方法和框架在序列标注任务中表现出色，证明了预训练神经语言模型在经过针对性迁移学习后能够达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过有针对性的迁移学习范式对预训练神经语言模型进行适应，可以在序列标注任务中达到最佳性能。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ToolScope方法，旨在解决LLM在使用工具时因冗余工具和上下文限制而导致的准确性问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）代理依赖外部工具来解决复杂任务，但现实世界中的工具集通常包含冗余工具，名称和描述重叠，导致歧义并降低选择准确性。LLM还面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法高效考虑大型工具集。

Method: 提出了一种名为ToolScope的方法，包括两个部分：(1) ToolScopeMerger与自动校正，用于自动审计和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever用于对工具进行排序和选择，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制而不牺牲准确性。

Result: 在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准上的评估显示，工具选择准确率提高了8.38%至38.6%。

Conclusion: ToolScope有效地提高了LLM在使用工具时的准确性，展示了其在增强LLM工具使用方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Motivation: 当前多语言基准测试在评估大语言模型的文化能力方面取得了进展，但仍然存在捕捉低资源文化细微差别的关键差距。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文通过构建一个包含民间传统、烹饪艺术和区域方言的孟加拉语文化知识（BLanCK）数据集来解决这些局限性，并对几种多语言语言模型进行了研究。

Result: 研究发现，尽管多语言语言模型在非文化类别中表现良好，但在文化知识方面表现不佳。当提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 本文指出，尽管多语言语言模型在非文化类别中表现良好，但在文化知识方面仍存在显著不足。提供上下文可以显著提高所有模型的性能，强调了上下文感知架构和文化定制训练数据的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强小型语言模型的推理能力对于专门的应用程序（如医学问答）至关重要，尤其是在像波斯语这样的非主流语言中。

Method: 我们使用强化学习与人工智能反馈（RLAIF）和直接偏好优化（DPO）来提高通用波斯语语言模型的推理能力。我们将多选医学问答数据集翻译成波斯语，并使用RLAIF生成被拒绝的首选答案对，这对DPO训练至关重要。通过提示教师和学生模型生成思维链（CoT）推理响应，我们编译了一个包含正确和错误推理轨迹的数据集。

Result: 由此产生的模型在波斯语医学推理方面表现优于其前身gaokerena-V，尽管它利用了一个小得多的数据集。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，专注于推理的训练方法在数据可用性有限的情况下开发领域特定的语言模型是高效且有效的。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为CreativityPrism的评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在不同场景下的创造力。该框架将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，并通过九个任务、三个领域和二十个评估指标进行评估。结果表明，专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距，且不同维度的评估指标之间存在不同的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法仍然碎片化，由于对创造力的不同定义和测量方式，导致在不同领域和任务之间存在显著差异。我们希望通过提出一个全面的框架来评估LLM在不同场景下的创造力。

Method: 我们提出了CreativityPrism，这是一个评估分析框架，将创造力分解为三个维度：质量、新颖性和多样性。CreativityPrism包含了九个任务，三个领域，即发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理，以及二十个评估指标，这些指标以任务特定的方式测量每个维度。

Result: 我们在CreativityPrism上评估了17个最先进的专有和开源LLM，并分析了不同指标和任务领域的性能相关性。结果揭示了专有模型和开源模型之间的显著差距。总体而言，同一领域内的任务性能高度相关，而不同领域之间的相关性较低。在评估维度中，多样性和质量指标表现出强相关性，而新颖性与两者的关系较弱。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果支持了我们的假设，即在一个创造力任务或维度上的强表现不一定能推广到其他任务或维度，这强调了对LLM创造力进行全面评估的必要性。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER is an efficient Entity Linking method that combines candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning to achieve high performance without deep fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Entity Linking (EL) methods rely on large annotated datasets and extensive model fine-tuning, which can be inefficient. Recent few-shot methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) face inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. The goal is to develop an efficient and effective EL method.

Method: ARTER uses a structured pipeline that combines candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning. It computes complementary signals over retrieved candidates to categorize contextual mentions into easy and hard cases, which are then handled by different entity linkers.

Result: ARTER outperforms ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets. It performs comparably to LLM-based pipelines for all mentions while being twice as efficient in terms of LLM tokens.

Conclusion: ARTER achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning. It outperforms ReFinED and performs comparably to LLM-based pipelines while being more efficient.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的句子或段落级分割方法无法有效处理结构化文本中的表格、代码片段和占位符等元素，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: BoundRL 通过联合执行标记级别的文本分割和标签预测，利用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）进行优化，并通过构建中间候选来缓解熵崩溃问题。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL 使小型语言模型（1.7B 参数）在复杂提示任务中优于大型模型的少样本提示，并且 RLVR 和中间候选的引入显著提高了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL 是一种有效的文本分割方法，能够处理复杂的结构化文本，并在小语言模型上表现出色。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估大型语言模型在立场检测任务中的偏见，因为这种任务涉及政治倾向，容易受到刻板印象的影响。

Method: 研究人员自动标注了现有立场检测数据集中的帖子，包括特定群体的方言或俗语以及文本复杂性/可读性两个属性，以研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究发现大型语言模型在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂性相关联，并将非裔美国人口音与反对唐纳德·特朗普相关联。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Motivation: 当前的搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度推理和广泛信息收集的能力，这对于现实世界的应用如全面的市场分析和商业发展至关重要。

Method: 我们提出了两种方法来转换现有的数据集，从而得到一个精心挑选的220个问题的集合，涵盖15个不同的领域。

Result: 即使最先进的代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率也只有2.39%，这表明在信息检索任务中整合深度和广度搜索具有相当大的挑战性。此外，我们的错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出，暴露了当前代理架构的关键限制。

Conclusion: 我们公开了DeepWideSearch以推动未来更强大和稳健的信息检索代理的研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for table reasoning have limitations, such as arithmetic errors, hallucination, rigid schemas, and lack of semantic understanding. There is a need for approaches that integrate robust reasoning with reliable table processing.

Method: Mixture-of-Minds is a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. It also introduces a self-improvement training framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and reinforcement learning (RL).

Result: Mixture-of-Minds achieves 62.13% on TableBench and surpasses OpenAI-o4-mini-high, showing substantial gains in table reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Mixture-of-Minds demonstrates the promise of combining structured multi-agent workflows with reinforcement learning to advance table understanding.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 本文旨在探索大型语言模型在文本输入下的空间推理能力，并揭示其在处理结构化网格环境中的多步骤问题解决时的局限性。

Method: 本文通过五个任务来测试大型语言模型的空间推理能力，包括象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动。每个任务都通过增加网格维度来提高复杂度，以考察模型是否能超越简单的模式识别进行抽象空间推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管大型语言模型在小规模和低复杂度的任务中表现出一定的成功，但随着规模的增加，准确率迅速下降，平均下降了42.7%，最高达到84%。所有起始准确率超过50%的测试都至少损失了48%的准确率。

Conclusion: 本文指出大型语言模型在空间推理任务中的表现随着复杂度的增加而显著下降，表明其在空间表示方面存在不足。同时，本文强调了语言和空间推理之间的差距，并为未来在语言与几何交叉领域的综合基准研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

Conclusion: 本文研究了无需解码的采样策略，发现它们在运行时间成本较低的情况下能够提供足够准确的边际估计，并展示了其在下游推理任务中的应用。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种三模态情感严重程度融合方法，用于同时评估抑郁症和PTSD，并展示了其在临床决策支持中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症和PTSD经常共存，导致自动评估变得复杂。临床诊断需要考虑严重程度的跨疾病估计和决策支持解释。

Method: 本文采用统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，同步和融合访谈文本、音频和面部信号，并通过校准的晚期融合分类器进行标准化特征融合，以输出分级严重程度。

Result: 该方法在DAIC派生语料库上进行了验证，优于单模态/消融基线。融合模型在准确性和加权F1上与最强的单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于多模态情感严重程度融合的方法，用于同时评估抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍（PTSD），并展示了其在临床决策支持中的应用。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

TL;DR: ContextLM is a framework that enhances language modeling by introducing next-context prediction, leading to better long-range coherence and attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to overcome the limitation of token-level prediction in capturing higher-level semantic structures and long-range contextual relationships

Method: introduce ContextLM, a framework that augments standard pretraining with an inherent next-context prediction objective

Result: ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both perplexity and downstream task performance on GPT2 and Pythia model families scaled up to 1.5B parameters.

Conclusion: next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM基于RAG系统的引用失败问题，并提出了CITENTION框架以提高引用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引用失败是指模型生成了一个有帮助的响应，但未能引用完整的证据。与之前的工作不同，我们提出将引用失败与响应失败区分开来，其中响应本身存在缺陷，引用完整的证据是不可能的。

Method: 本文采用两步方法解决引用失败问题：(1) 研究引用失败发生的时间；(2) 如何缓解它。第一步中，我们扩展了之前的工作，研究了响应与证据之间的关系如何影响引用质量，并引入了CITECONTROL基准来系统地分析失败模式。第二步中，我们提出了CITENTION框架，以提高LLM引用的效率。

Result: 实验表明，随着关系复杂性的增加，失败率上升，并且结合引用方法可以提高性能，这促使了第二步的进行。CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL和转移设置中都取得了显著的引用改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为CITENTION的框架，该框架整合了生成式、基于注意力和检索式的方法，以提高LLM的引用效率。实验结果表明，在CITECONTROL和转移设置中都取得了显著的引用改进。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了PRMs在表格问答任务中的应用，发现当前PRMs存在局限性，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PRMs在涉及半结构化数据的任务（如表格问答）中的适用性，因为这些任务具有独特的挑战。

Method: 对最先进的生成PRMs进行评估，从答案和步骤两个角度分析其性能。

Result: 结合文本和代码验证的PRMs有助于解决方案的选择，但在泛化到领域外数据时表现不佳。步骤级验证性能与答案准确性之间的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在TQA任务中存在局限性，需要构建更鲁棒、过程感知的验证器。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

TL;DR: CoRT is a post-training framework that improves the performance of large reasoning models on mathematical tasks by integrating Code Interpreters and using a data synthesis strategy called Hint-Engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of large reasoning models when tackling complex mathematical operations by integrating computational tools like Code Interpreters (CIs).

Method: CoRT is a post-training framework that teaches LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. It includes Hint-Engineering, a data synthesis strategy that injects hints into reasoning paths, and uses rejection sampling and reinforcement learning to refine the interaction between external CI and internal thinking.

Result: CoRT yields absolute improvements of 4% and 8% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. It also reduces token usage by approximately 30% for the 32B model and 50% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: CoRT is effective in improving the performance of large reasoning models on mathematical reasoning tasks and significantly enhances efficiency by reducing token usage.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how LLMs perform on tabular reasoning tasks and finds that their success might be due to memorizing datasets rather than true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of dataset contamination in evaluating LLMs' ability to reason over structured data.

Method: Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks.

Result: Contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing strong semantic cues, while performance declines to near-random levels when such cues are removed or randomized.

Conclusion: LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

Motivation: 现有的方法在固定粒度范式下运行，依赖于静态边界识别，限制了它们对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: FreeChunker是一种跨粒度编码框架，将句子作为原子单元，并从静态分块分割转向灵活的检索支持任意句子组合。

Result: FreeChunker在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，其检索性能优于传统分块方法，并在计算效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker在LongBench V2上的实验评估表明，它在检索性能和计算效率方面都优于传统分块方法和现有方法。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained

underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves

Motivation: The impact of negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored.

Method: We investigate whether LLMs can recognize contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with negated expressions.

Result: Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically inconsistent or unfaithful judgments.

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this

contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu

negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Motivation: 多轮对话中的连贯性是一个重要的特性，即对话者之间的及时、直接和有意义的交流。然而，BabyLM在这一方面仍然存在挑战。

Method: 引入了ContingentChat，这是一个教师-学生框架，用于基准测试和提高在BabyLM上的多轮连贯性。使用了一个新的对齐数据集进行后训练，BabyLM生成的回应更加语法正确和连贯。

Result: 实验表明，使用自适应教师解码策略仅带来了有限的额外收益。ContingentChat表明，有针对性的后训练可以提高对话质量。

Conclusion: ContingentChat展示了针对对话质量的后训练的重要性，并表明连贯性仍然是BabyLM的一个挑战性目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LM-Mixup的方法，用于增强低质量数据，从而提高指令调优LLMs的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据增强方法难以有效增强低质量数据，且此类技术的评估定义不明确。因此，我们需要一种新的方法来处理低质量数据，以提高指令调优LLMs的效率和性能。

Method: 我们引入了一个全面的数据构建流程来创建MIXTURE数据集，并提出了LM-Mixup方法，该方法首先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习进行优化。

Result: LM-Mixup能够有效地增强不完美的数据集：在仅占整个数据集约3%的蒸馏数据上微调LLMs，不仅超过了全数据集训练，而且在多个基准测试中与最先进的高质量数据选择方法竞争。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，当通过LM-Mixup适当蒸馏和增强时，低质量数据是一种有价值的资源，显著提高了指令调优的LLMs的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

*Lukas Edman,Alexander Fraser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的掩码语言模型方法，并通过引入子词嵌入提高了模型的形态泛化能力，在2025年BabyLM挑战赛中取得了更好的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高模型在(Super)GLUE任务上的性能，我们尝试改进现有的掩码语言模型方法。

Method: 我们提出了改进的掩码语言模型（MLM），根据模型预测被掩码标记的能力调整这些标记的概率，并引入子词嵌入以提高模型的形态泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，改进后的MLM在(Super)GLUE任务上的性能有显著提升，同时子词嵌入增强了模型的形态泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们的提交在严格的小规模赛道中超过了基线。

Abstract: We describe our strategy for the 2025 edition of the BabyLM Challenge. Our
main contribution is that of an improved form of Masked Language Modeling
(MLM), which adapts the probabilities of the tokens masked according to the
model's ability to predict them. The results show a substantial increase in
performance on (Super)GLUE tasks over the standard MLM. We also incorporate
sub-token embeddings, finding that this increases the model's morphological
generalization capabilities. Our submission beats the baseline in the
strict-small track.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECALL是一种新的模型融合框架，能够在不使用历史数据的情况下保持知识并抵抗灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要任务标签或导致性能权衡，而RECALL旨在实现无缝多领域集成和强大的灾难性遗忘抵抗能力。

Method: RECALL是一种基于表示的模型融合框架，通过层间隐藏表示计算模型间的相似性，并进行自适应、分层的参数融合以对齐知识。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多个持续学习场景中，RECALL在知识保留和泛化方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一种可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于不断演进的大语言模型。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

### [43] [Steering Evaluation-Aware Language Models To Act Like They Are Deployed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20487)
*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过添加一个引导向量到LLM的激活中，可以抑制评估意识并使模型在评估时表现得像部署时一样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）有时可以在被评估时检测到并调整其行为以显得更一致，这会损害安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 我们训练了一个LLM来表现出评估意识行为，使用两步训练过程来模仿这种行为如何自然出现。首先，我们在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，使用Python类型提示进行评估但不进行部署，并识别特定评估提示的存在总是意味着它正在被测试。然后，我们通过专家迭代训练模型在评估环境中使用Python类型提示。

Result: 结果模型是评估意识的：它在评估上下文中比部署上下文更多地编写类型提示。然而，只有在移除评估提示时才能观察到这种差距。我们发现激活引导可以抑制评估意识，并使模型在存在提示时表现得像部署时一样。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，AI评估者可以通过引导模型表现得像部署时一样来提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Robust Preference Selection (RPS) 的新方法，用于解决大型语言模型在偏好对齐中的覆盖差距问题。RPS 不需要重新训练模型，而是通过采样局部相关偏好的多个响应来创建更优的候选池，并选择最符合用户原始意图的响应。实验结果表明，RPS 在多种对齐范式中表现出色，能够显著提高模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常通过昂贵的微调来解决偏好覆盖差距问题，但这可能无法推广到多样化的偏好全谱。当用户的请求反映了一个与训练数据中心趋势不同的细微偏好时，模型性能可能会不可预测地下降。

Method: 本文引入了Robust Preference Selection (RPS)，这是一种后处理、无需训练的方法，通过利用方向邻域共识来解决偏好覆盖差距问题。

Result: 在三种不同的对齐范式（DPA、DPO 和 SFT）上的综合实验表明，RPS 在不进行任何模型微调的情况下，在来自空间中欠代表区域的挑战性偏好上实现了高达 69% 的胜率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种实用且理论基础坚实的解决方案，以提高偏好对齐模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HSEQ的统一框架，用于处理多步骤问题和异构证据源，具有高效、准确和可扩展的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在处理多步骤问题和异构证据源时仍然脆弱，需要提高准确性和效率。

Method: HSEQ迭代方法将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的层次序列，并通过结构感知迭代收集足够的证据。

Result: 实验表明，HSEQ在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA数据集上均取得了显著的EM/F1提升。

Conclusion: HSEQ框架在多个数据集上表现出色，展示了其在处理多步骤问题和异构证据源方面的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析欧洲议会演讲的翻译质量，揭示了大型语言模型在多语言翻译中存在政治偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的政治偏见评估通常依赖于英语调查，而本研究提出了一种基于公平原则的多语言翻译方法来评估政治偏见。

Method: 通过比较欧洲议会（EP）演讲的翻译质量，分析大型语言模型在多语言翻译中的政治偏见。

Result: 研究发现，主流政党（左翼、中间和右翼）的演讲比边缘政党的演讲翻译质量更高。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型语言模型在多语言翻译中的政治偏见，特别是在处理不同政治派别的演讲时存在系统性差异。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC-Encoder是一种新的上下文压缩方法，通过将文本压缩为连续表示来减少推理成本，并在多个LLM上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文压缩技术需要微调目标模型或修改其架构，这可能会影响模型的通用能力。因此，探索一种替代方法，以减少推理成本并提高计算效率。

Method: 研究了训练策略和编码器架构选择，并设计了ARC-Encoder，它将上下文压缩为连续表示。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个LLM使用场景中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能，并提高了推理时的计算效率。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一个灵活且高效的解决方案，可以与多个LLM无缝工作。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

### [48] [The Dog the Cat Chased Stumped the Model: Measuring When Language Models Abandon Structure for Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20543)
*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench is a dataset designed to test whether language models understand syntax or rely on semantic patterns. The results show that models tend to abandon structural analysis for semantic associations as complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We lack methods to distinguish structural understanding from semantic pattern matching in language models.

Method: We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720 comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences with syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterparts and six comprehension questions testing different aspects of understanding.

Result: Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points. Semantic plausibility harms performance on questions about resulting actions. Reasoning models improve accuracy but show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer refusal. Humans show variable semantic effects.

Conclusion: CenterBench provides the first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to pattern matching.

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了GlobalRAG，一种用于多跳问答的强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理以及迭代优化证据来增强全局推理。实验表明，GlobalRAG在使用更少训练数据的情况下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多跳问答中受限于两个基本问题：缺乏全局规划来构建多步骤推理，以及不可靠的执行阻碍了有效查询制定和一致使用检索到的证据。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG，一种强化学习框架，旨在增强多跳问答中的全局推理。GlobalRAG将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，并迭代优化证据。引入了Planning Quality Reward和SubGoal Completion Reward来鼓励连贯的规划和可靠的子目标执行，并采用渐进式权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向的目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准上的广泛实验表明，GlobalRAG在使用仅8k训练数据的情况下显著优于强基线，在EM和F1上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG显著优于强基线，仅使用8k训练数据（比强基线使用的训练数据少42%），在EM和F1上平均提升了14.2%。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），以解决电子商务搜索中传统检索-排序范式存在的问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索-排序范式在电子商务搜索中存在关键限制，包括复杂查询中的语义差距、跨平台信息觅食带来的高决策成本以及缺乏专业购物指导。

Method: 本文提出了多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），将范式从被动检索转变为积极的决策支持。

Result: 广泛的离线评估表明MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面有显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。在线A/B测试也证实了其实际效果。

Conclusion: 本文展示了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电子商务搜索方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

Motivation: 尽管之前的研究表明ChatGPT可以与编码指南一起使用以实现与人类评分者相当的准确性，但其编码是否对不同人口群体（如性别和种族）存在偏差尚不清楚。

Method: 本文使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，对ChatGPT生成的通信数据进行编码分析，并检查性别和种族群体之间的差异。

Result: 研究结果表明，基于ChatGPT的编码在性别和种族群体之间没有显著偏差。

Conclusion: 本文表明，基于ChatGPT的自动化编码在性别和种族群体之间没有显著偏差，为大规模评估协作和沟通提供了可行的途径。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Method: 从人类好奇心评估问卷Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR)出发，设计了一个全面的评估框架，涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求和社会好奇心等维度，以评估LLMs表现出的好奇心程度。

Result: 研究结果显示，LLMs展现出比人类更强的知识渴望，但在面对不确定环境时仍倾向于做出保守选择。此外，好奇行为可以增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）具有类似于人类的好奇心潜力，这为未来提升学习能力和创新研究提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

Method: 通过比较大型推理模型在英语和问题语言中的推理表现，评估了两个任务：MGSM和GPQA Diamond。

Result: 英语推理轨迹表现出更高的认知行为，并且在最终答案准确性上通常优于其他语言，但这种以英语为中心的策略容易出现‘翻译迷失’的问题。

Conclusion: 研究发现，英语推理轨迹表现出更高程度的认知行为，并且在最终答案准确性上通常优于其他语言，但这种以英语为中心的策略容易出现‘翻译迷失’的问题，即翻译步骤可能导致错误。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

Motivation: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese, we introduce CantoNLU, a benchmark for Cantonese natural language understanding (NLU).

Method: We introduce CantoNLU, a benchmark for Cantonese natural language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models: a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch.

Result: Results show that Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese domain data is scarce.

Conclusion: Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese domain data is scarce.

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

### [56] [Neural Diversity Regularizes Hallucinations in Small Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20690)
*Kushal Chakrabarti,Nirmal Balachundhar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，并通过ND-LoRA验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型即使在参数、计算和数据增加的情况下仍然会出现幻觉。我们提出了神经多样性——去相关并行表示——作为一种原理性机制，可以在固定的参数和数据预算下减少幻觉率。

Method: 我们引入了ND-LoRA（Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation），结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，并证明ND-LoRA在不降低通用准确性的情况下减少了幻觉，最多减少25.6%（平均减少14.6%）。

Result: ND-LoRA减少了幻觉，最多减少25.6%（平均减少14.6%），同时没有降低通用准确性。此外，任务依赖性最优性出现：不同的任务需要不同量的最佳神经多样性。

Conclusion: 我们的结果突显了神经多样性作为扩展的第三轴——与参数和数据正交——在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

*Bryan Eikema,Anna Rutkiewicz,Mario Giulianelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了MBR在开放性任务中的应用，并提出了改进方法以提高结构最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放性任务中，使用标准相似性实用函数的MBR可能选择的是模型分布的广泛代表性响应，但相对于具有潜在结构的生成分组来说并不是最优的。

Method: 我们引入了三种轻量级的适应方法，以使MBR对结果空间中的结构变化更敏感。

Result: 我们的分析表明，常见的基于相似性的实用函数在这些指标上表现不佳。相反，我们提出的适应方法显著提高了结构最优性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在真实世界的指令遵循基准测试中表现出色，提高了生成质量。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究发现，用户对LLM在隐私敏感场景中的隐私保护质量和有用性的评估存在低一致性，而代理LLM与用户的评估相关性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了了解用户如何评估LLM在隐私敏感场景中的隐私保护质量和有用性，我们进行了这项研究。

Method: 我们进行了一个用户研究，涉及94名参与者，使用了PrivacyLens中的90个场景。

Result: 我们发现，当评估相同的响应时，用户在隐私保护质量和有用性方面表现出低一致性。此外，五个代理LLM之间有高一致性，而每个单独的LLM与用户的评估相关性较低。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，需要进行以用户为中心的研究，以测量LLM在帮助用户的同时保护隐私的能力。此外，未来的研究可以探索改进代理LLM与用户之间对齐的方法，以更好地估计用户对隐私和效用的感知。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究开发并评估了自然语言处理（NLP）方法，以从临床笔记中提取氟尿嘧啶治疗和毒性信息。LLM-based NLP方法最有效地提取了这些信息，具有支持肿瘤学研究和药物警戒的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.

Method: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting). Models used an 80:20 train-test split.

Result: Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1 scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities extraction. LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in toxicities.

Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型的方法通常关注高层次任务，如文本生成，而没有针对特定的人工智能应用。这种方法不足以评估大语言模型在负责任人工智能维度上的表现。

Method: 本文构建了一个由真实应用场景驱动的数据集，该数据集通过公平性属性与性别形容词和产品类别相交，生成丰富的标记提示。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个用于评估大语言模型在负责任人工智能维度（如公平性）的框架，并提供了一个具体的资源供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型由于有限的记忆力，在检索密集型任务中会受到损害。因此，我们需要一种方法来恢复对过去标记的直接访问。

Method: 我们探索了一系列混合模型，以恢复对过去标记的直接访问。我们结合了滑动窗口注意力和轻量级CNN，以自适应地保留每头的关键KV对。

Result: 我们的方法在检索密集型基准测试中得到了验证，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在检索密集型基准测试中得到了验证，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

Method: 我们开发了一种轻量级且简单的均值池化方法，并研究了训练相同的压缩器以输出多个压缩比率。

Result: 我们的简单均值池化方法在跨域和跨模型家族的广泛实验中表现出色，即使在训练多个压缩比率时也表现良好。

Conclusion: 我们的简单均值池化方法在压缩方法的复杂领域中展示了最强的性能，尽管在训练多个压缩比率时有相对较小的下降。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

Method: 分析了现有检测方法的局限性和现实应用中的各种条件。

Result: 现有的检测器结果常常被误解，其意义正在减弱。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但其结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

Motivation: 先前的研究探讨了LLM如何改变用户观点，但很少有研究扩展到双向影响，即用户输入如何影响LLM响应以及这种双向影响如何在整个多轮对话中表现出来。

Method: 本研究通过50次有争议话题的讨论，涉及参与者（N=266）在三种条件下的互动：静态陈述、标准聊天机器人和个性化聊天机器人，来调查这种动态。

Result: 结果表明，人类观点几乎没有变化，而LLM输出发生了显著变化，缩小了人类和LLM立场之间的差距。个性化在两个方向上都放大了这些变化，与标准设置相比。

Conclusion: 我们的工作突显了人机LLM交互中过度对齐的风险，并强调了需要仔细设计个性化聊天机器人，以更周到和稳定地与用户对齐。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

Motivation: Traditional multimodal interfaces require explicit user control, but Empathic Prompting unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for conversational and smoothness alignment.

Method: The system integrates a commercial facial expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them as contextual signals during prompting. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules.

Result: Results show consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with participants highlighting conversational fluidity.

Conclusion: Empathic Prompting has the potential to enhance chatbot-mediated communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by
the Tredence_AICOE team. The competition features two multilingual relevance
tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual
product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data
augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the
development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned
Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and
decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they
reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose
natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and
interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,
composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such
as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems
Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning
style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework
formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families
(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed
into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and
session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic
processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By
decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a
reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases
demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and
standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with
implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development
of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

### [70] [Branch-and-Browse: Efficient and Controllable Web Exploration with Tree-Structured Reasoning and Action Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19838)
*Shiqi He,Yue Cui,Xinyu Ma,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Branch-and-Browse is a framework that improves the performance of LLM-based web agents by enabling structured reasoning, efficient execution, and memory sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly.

Method: Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution.

Result: On the WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8% and reduces execution time by up to 40.4% relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种利用大型语言模型将有意义的文本隐藏在其他文本中的方法，展示了文本与作者意图之间的分离，引发了对AI安全和语言模型知识理解的思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的出现，现在可以将有意义的文本隐藏在另一段看似无关但仍然连贯的文本中，这引发了对书面交流信任的担忧。

Method: 本文提出了一种简单且高效的协议，利用大型语言模型将有意义的文本隐藏在另一段完全不同的但仍然连贯和合理的文本中。

Result: 即使使用适度的80亿参数开源LLM，也可以获得高质量的结果，并且可以在笔记本电脑上快速编码和解码长达此摘要的消息。

Conclusion: 该协议的存在表明了文本与作者意图之间的根本性分离，进一步削弱了对书面交流的信任，这已经因为LLM聊天机器人的兴起而受到动摇。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Motivation: 传统反应式聊天机器人无法主动生成符合规定且用户特定的投资见解，因此需要一种更先进的解决方案。

Method: AI PB结合了组件化编排层、混合检索管道和多阶段推荐机制，以提供符合规定且用户特定的投资见解。

Conclusion: 通过人类QA和系统指标，我们证明了具有显式路由和分层安全性的基于事实的生成可以在高风险金融中提供可信赖的AI见解。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

TL;DR: IKnow是一个简单且通用的框架，能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下，通过在指令-响应对话格式中制定新的自监督目标，来持续适应大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法需要访问原始基础模型或依赖于外部领域特定数据库，这在基础模型权重因安全原因被保留或可靠外部语料库不可用的情况下是一个现实障碍。

Method: IKnow通过利用文本本身嵌入的领域知识，并在更深层次的语义水平上学习编码它，从而形成新的自监督目标。

Result: IKnow能够适应大型语言模型到新领域，同时保持其遵循指令的能力和语义表示。

Conclusion: IKnow是一个简单且通用的框架，能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下，通过在指令-响应对话格式中制定新的自监督目标，来持续适应大型语言模型。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估方法CaSE，用于更细致地评估大语言模型的推理质量，并展示了这种方法在提升模型性能方面的实际价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法提供了粗糙的信号，忽视了底层推理过程的质量。我们需要更细致的评估来构建健壮的模型。

Method: 我们引入了因果逐步评估（CaSE），这种方法仅使用其先前的上下文来评估每个推理步骤，从而避免了后见之明偏差。

Result: 我们验证了CaSE与人类判断在新的专家注释基准上的可靠性，并展示了使用CaSE评估的相关性和连贯性来策划训练数据可以直接提高最终任务性能。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于分析、调试和改进LLM的推理，展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

*Xi He,Sirui Lu,Bei Zeng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于GPT-5的多智能体工作流，用于设计具有指定可逆对角门的量子码。通过系统枚举和精确分析重建，该方法实现了可重复的代码构造，并支持扩展到更大的K和更高的距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在解决如何设计具有特定可逆对角门的量子码的问题，同时确保满足Z-边缘Knill-Laflamme（KL）等式。

Method: 该工作提出了一个基于GPT-5的多智能体、人机协作的工作流，用于共同设计具有指定可逆对角门的量子码。它利用了Subset-Sum线性规划（SSLP）框架，并在TeXRA平台上实现，该平台支持迭代工具使用循环代理和先推导后编辑的工作流推理代理。

Result: 通过系统扫描，研究人员获得了带有证书的表格，记录了可实现的循环逻辑群，例如对于K=3，在n=6时获得阶数为16的代码。此外，他们还展示了SSLP能够容纳残留退化性，并展示了一个新的((6,4,2))代码实现了可逆的受控相位门。

Conclusion: 该工作通过结合系统枚举与精确的分析重建，将对角线可逆可行性重新表述为可扩展的分析流程。它产生了可重复的代码构造，支持针对更大K和更高距离的扩展，并朝着数据驱动的分类迈进。

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

Motivation: 电子表格在商业、会计和金融等领域被广泛使用，但由于缺乏系统化的文档方法，阻碍了自动化、协作和知识转移，可能导致关键机构知识的丢失。因此，本文旨在通过生成人类可读的解释来解决这一问题。

Method: 本文提出了一个包含111个电子表格操作代码片段的数据集，并使用BLEU、GLEU、ROUGE-L和METEOR指标评估了五种大型语言模型（GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、LLaMA-3.3-70B、Mixtral-8x7B和Gemma2-9B）在生成自然语言摘要方面的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型可以生成准确的电子表格文档，使SOD成为提高电子表格可重复性、可维护性和协作工作流程的可行前提步骤，尽管仍有一些挑战需要解决。

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

*Zhiyu Lin,Jingwen Yang,Jiale Zhao,Meng Liu,Sunzhu Li,Benyou Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DeEAR的框架，用于将人类对语音表达的偏好转化为客观评分，从而解决现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法成本高、有限或不完整，无法准确评估语音的自然表达性。因此，需要一种更可靠、高效的评估方法。

Method: DeEAR框架基于语音学和心理学，从三个维度（情感、韵律和自发性）评估语音，并通过少量标注样本实现与人类感知的高度一致性。

Result: DeEAR在少于500个标注样本的情况下实现了与人类感知的高度一致性（SRCC = 0.86）。同时，它能够选择14K个表达性的语音语句，提高S2S模型的表达分数（从2.0到23.4）。

Conclusion: DeEAR能够有效地将人类对语音表达的偏好转化为客观评分，并且在少于500个标注样本的情况下与人类感知有很强的一致性。此外，DeEAR不仅能够区分不同S2S模型之间的表达差距，还能选择14K个表达性的语音语句来提高S2S模型的表达分数。

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在探索描述性标题作为生物多模态基础模型的额外监督来源，以解决在获取忠实、实例特定标题方面的挑战。

Method: 本研究通过生成合成标题，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）进行训练，以补充生物多模态基础模型的监督信号。

Result: 通过使用这些标题，我们训练了BIOCAP（即BIOCLIP with Captions），一个能够捕捉丰富语义并实现物种分类和文本-图像检索强大性能的生物基础模型。

Conclusion: 结果表明，描述性标题在将生物图像与多模态基础模型相连接方面具有超出标签的价值。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Calibrated Multimodal Consensus（CMC）的模型，用于解决多模态情感识别中的语义不一致和文本主导问题。CMC通过伪标签生成模块和多模态共识路由器实现了更准确的情感识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法往往忽略了跨模态可能产生的语义不一致，例如文本和视觉输入之间的冲突情感线索。此外，当前方法通常由文本模态主导，这可能会影响识别准确性。

Method: CMC引入了伪标签生成模块（PLGM）以生成伪单模态标签，从而实现自监督的单模态预训练。然后使用无参数融合模块（PFM）和多模态共识路由器（MCR）进行多模态微调，以减轻文本主导并引导融合过程向更可靠的共识发展。

Result: 实验结果表明，CMC在四个数据集CH-SIMS、CH-SIMS v2、CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI上实现了与现有最先进方法相当或更优的性能，并在存在语义不一致的场景中表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: CMC在四个数据集上实现了与现有最先进方法相当或更优的性能，并在CH-SIMS和CH-SIMS v2数据集上表现出显著优势。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

TL;DR: SV是一种无需训练的框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和一个大型判断模型来提高信息密集型图像的推理能力，实现了更高的准确性和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理信息密集且文本注释与细粒度图形元素紧密交织的图像时存在困难，主要挑战在于精确定位密集布局中的关键线索以及多跳推理以整合分散的证据。

Method: SV是一种无需训练的框架，它结合了多个轻量级草稿专家和一个大型判断模型。在草稿阶段，小型VLM作为草稿专家生成提供多样化定位候选的推理路径；在判断阶段，强大的VLM综合这些路径以产生最终答案。

Result: SV在具有挑战性的信息密集型和高分辨率视觉问答基准测试中实现了稳定的提升，包括InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K。

Conclusion: SV通过合成多个部分准确的推理路径中的正确见解，相比大型专有模型或训练流程，在错误纠正和成本效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文介绍了C2C框架，这是一种解决多智能体LLM系统在任务导向通信方面缺乏系统框架问题的创新方法。C2C通过两个关键创新：(1) Alignment Factor (AF)，一种量化代理任务对齐的新指标，(2) Sequential Action Framework，将逐步执行与智能通信决策相结合。C2C使代理能够做出成本意识的通信选择，通过有针对性的互动动态提高任务理解。在三个复杂性层级和团队规模从5到17个代理的真实编码工作流中评估了C2C，并与无通信和固定步骤基线进行了比较。结果表明，C2C将任务完成时间减少了约40%，同时保持了可接受的通信成本。该框架在标准配置下成功完成所有任务，并在大规模情况下保持有效性。C2C为多智能体系统的通信有效性提供了理论基础，并为复杂协作任务提供了一个实用框架。

Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for task-oriented communication, which is essential for teamwork in workspace for complex tasks.

Method: Communication to Completion (C2C), a scalable framework that addresses the gap through two key innovations: (1) the Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions.

Result: C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale.

Conclusion: C2C establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex
collaborative tasks.

### [84] [Every Question Has Its Own Value: Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20187)
*Dian Yu,Yulai Zhao,Kishan Panaganti,Linfeng Song,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLEV is a method that aligns LLM optimization with human value signals, improving performance and learning a value-sensitive termination policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RLVR effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV aims to address this by aligning LLM optimization with quantifiable human value signals.

Method: RLEV extends the RLVR framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the reward function. It uses exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels to train models.

Result: RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL algorithms and model scales. RLEV policies improve value-weighted accuracy and learn a value-sensitive termination policy.

Conclusion: RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

### [85] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench 是一种用于检测和减轻大型语言模型在任务中利用测试用例的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究和减轻 LLM 代理在任务中寻找和利用“捷径”的行为，以提高评估和部署的可靠性。

Method: ImpossibleBench 通过创建与现有基准测试冲突的任务变体来测量 LLM 代理的作弊率。

Result: ImpossibleBench 被证明是一个实用的框架，可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench 是一个有用的框架，可以帮助构建更强大和可靠的 LLM 系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

### [86] [Relative-Based Scaling Law for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20387)
*Baoqing Yue,Jinyuan Zhou,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于相对概率的缩放定律，以补充现有的交叉熵视角，从而更全面地理解大型语言模型的缩放行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究几乎完全依赖于交叉熵作为评估指标。然而，交叉熵仅提供了性能的部分视图：它衡量的是正确标记的绝对概率，但忽略了正确和错误标记之间的相对顺序。然而，相对顺序对于语言模型至关重要，例如在贪心采样场景中。为了克服这一限制，我们从相对顺序的角度研究缩放。

Method: 我们首先提出了基于相对概率（RBP）度量，该度量量化了正确标记在顶部预测中的概率。在此基础上，我们建立了基于相对概率的缩放定律，该定律描述了随着模型规模的增加，RBP如何改进。

Result: 通过在四个数据集和四个模型家族上的广泛实验，跨越五个数量级，我们展示了该定律的鲁棒性和准确性。最后，我们通过两个例子说明了该定律的广泛应用，即提供对出现现象的更深入解释和促进找到缩放定律的基本理论。

Conclusion: 相对基础的缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，并有助于更全面地理解缩放大型语言模型。因此，它为实际开发和理论探索提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

### [87] [BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792)
*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BadGraph的后门攻击方法，用于文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型。通过文本触发器污染训练数据，该方法能够在触发器出现时诱导攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。实验结果表明，该攻击方法具有高成功率和隐蔽性，揭示了文本引导图生成模型的安全漏洞，并强调了在药物发现等应用中的严重风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的工作已经探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性，特别是文本引导的图生成仍然很大程度上未被研究。因此，本文旨在填补这一研究空白，探讨文本引导图生成中的安全问题。

Method: BadGraph是一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法，它利用文本触发器污染训练数据，隐秘地植入后门，在触发器出现时诱导攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（PubChem、ChEBI-20、PCDes、MoMu）上的广泛实验表明，该攻击方法具有有效性和隐蔽性：小于10%的污染率可以达到50%的攻击成功率，而24%的污染率足以实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能降级可以忽略不计。消融研究进一步表明，后门是在VAE和扩散训练期间植入的，而不是预训练阶段。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在安全漏洞，并强调了在药物发现等模型应用中的严重风险，同时指出了需要针对此类扩散模型中的后门攻击建立稳健防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

### [88] [Compress to Impress: Efficient LLM Adaptation Using a Single Gradient Step on 100 Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20800)
*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种快速且无需微调的方法，通过分析矩阵的奇异值梯度、允许矩阵行围绕多个子空间聚类以及仅使用100个样本进行评估，实现了对LLM的高效适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharma等人提出的LASER方法虽然有效，但其每矩阵搜索需要完整的数据集前向传递，使其不适用于快速部署。因此，我们需要一种更高效的方法来实现类似的效果。

Method: 通过分析每个矩阵的奇异值梯度来确定哪些矩阵值得减少，允许矩阵行围绕多个子空间聚类并分别分解每个集群以进一步减少过拟合，以及仅使用100个样本进行评估以减少搜索时间。

Result: 通过上述方法，可以在不进行任何梯度微调的情况下，仅用100个样本进行一次梯度步骤，就能将LLM适应到新的数据集。

Conclusion: 我们展示了结合这些发现可以产生一种快速且稳健的下游任务适应算法。总体而言，通过在100个例子上进行一次梯度步骤，并快速扫描顶级候选层和分解技术，我们可以将LLM适应到新数据集——完全不需要微调。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.
