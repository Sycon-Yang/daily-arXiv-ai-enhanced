### [1] [Collaborative and Proactive Management of Task-Oriented Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05110)
*Arezoo Saedi,Afsaneh Fatemi,Mohammad Ali Nematbakhsh,Sophie Rosset,Anne Vilnat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息状态方法的任务导向对话管理系统模型，通过构造性中间信息和大语言模型的上下文学习能力实现，实验结果表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的任务导向对话系统在目标感知规划方面存在不足，而有效的规划对于任务完成至关重要。因此，本文旨在创建一种能够有效管理任务导向对话的模型。

Method: 该论文提出了一种基于信息状态方法的对话管理系统模型，结合了构造性的中间信息，并利用大语言模型的上下文学习能力进行实现。

Result: 该模型在MultiWOZ数据集上的测试结果显示，其在信息和成功率方面达到了最大值，并且优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: 该模型在MultiWOZ数据集上进行了评估，结果表明其在信息和成功率方面表现最佳，并且相比之前的方法有所改进。

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

### [2] [Trainable Reference-Based Evaluation Metric for Identifying Quality of English-Gujarati Machine Translation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05113)
*Nisheeth Joshi,Pragya Katyayan,Palak Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于监督学习的参考性机器翻译评估指标，用于古吉拉特语，并在实验中显示出比其他可用指标更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的方法在英语和其他欧洲语言上表现良好，但在印度语言上效果不佳，因此需要一种适用于古吉拉特语的参考性机器翻译评估指标。

Method: 该论文提出了一种基于监督学习的参考性机器翻译评估指标，使用25个特征进行训练，并训练了两个版本的模型，分别具有6层和10层隐藏层，每个模型都进行了500次迭代。

Result: 通过实验，该论文开发的指标在与人类参考翻译比较时表现出更好的人类相关性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个基于监督学习的参考性机器翻译评估指标，用于古吉拉特语，并且在实验中表现出比其他可用指标更好的人类相关性。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

### [3] [Hallucination is Inevitable for LLMs with the Open World Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05116)
*Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文将“幻觉”重新定义为泛化问题的表现，并建议将其视为一种结构特征以与人类智能兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探讨幻觉在人工智能通用智能（AGI）条件下的理论不可避免性，并提出将其视为结构特征的必要性。

Method: 本文重新定义了“幻觉”，并根据封闭世界和开放世界的假设对其进行了分类。

Result: 本文表明，在封闭世界假设下，幻觉可以被缓解；而在开放世界假设下，幻觉是不可避免的。

Conclusion: 本文认为应将“幻觉”视为一种结构特征，而不是仅仅作为工程缺陷来处理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索大型语言模型在经济领域中提取结构化知识的有效性，特别是在处理自然语言法律贸易协议文本时。

Method: 研究使用了Llama 3.1模型，通过零样本、单样本和少量样本提示技术来提取结构化知识。

Result: 研究评估了不同提示技术的性能，并展示了从区域贸易协议文本中提取贸易相关信息三元组的效果。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
the extraction of structured knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object
triples. We apply the setup for the domain of Economics application. The
findings can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the creation of
economic trade knowledge graphs from natural language legal trade agreement
texts. As a use case, we apply the model to regional trade agreement texts to
extract trade-related information triples. In particular, we explore the
zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques, incorporating positive
and negative examples, and evaluate their performance based on quantitative and
qualitative metrics. Specifically, we used Llama 3.1 model to process the
unstructured regional trade agreement texts and extract triples. We discuss key
insights, challenges, and potential future directions, emphasizing the
significance of language models in economic applications.

### [5] [CARE: Cognitive-reasoning Augmented Reinforcement for Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05122)
*Jie Zhu,Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出CARE框架，通过增强认知推理来提升情感支持对话的质量，无需依赖大规模合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注数据增强和合成语料库构建，但常常忽视有效情感支持背后更深层次的认知推理过程。

Method: CARE框架利用原始ESC训练集引导模型生成逻辑连贯和支持性的响应，从而明确增强认知推理。进一步采用强化学习来精炼和加强推理过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，CARE显著提高了响应的逻辑严谨性和支持质量。

Conclusion: CARE显著提高了响应的逻辑严谨性和支持质量，推动了共情、认知稳健和类人情感支持系统的开发。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

### [6] [MADS: Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation for Diverse Persuasion Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05124)
*Mingjin Li,Yu Liu,Huayi Liu,Xiang Ye,Chao Jiang,Hongguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MADS是一个用于生成有说服力的多轮对话的可扩展框架，通过代理自博弈实现。它包括三个协调的代理：用户代理模拟多样化的角色驱动行为，对话代理执行任务导向的说服策略，优化代理评估和改进对话结果。该方法在真实世界的营销场景中显著提高了小型LLM的说服能力，增加了有机流量转化率22.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行业挑战，如缺乏用户数据、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低下，同时降低成本并提高说服能力。

Method: MADS采用三个协调的代理：用户代理、对话代理和优化代理，通过自我博弈生成对话，并利用用户的链式态度模型和专用LLM的说服评估来验证其有效性。

Result: 在真实世界的营销场景中，MADS显著提高了小型LLM的说服能力，使有机流量转化率提高了22.4%。

Conclusion: MADS展示了明确的商业价值，能够有效生成训练数据，无需人工标注。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

### [7] [Catalog-Native LLM: Speaking Item-ID Dialect with Less Entanglement for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05125)
*Reza Shirkavand,Xiaokai Wei,Chen Wang,Zheng Hui,Heng Huang,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了IDIOMoE，一种将项目交互历史视为语言空间中的原生方言的方法，从而在推荐系统中结合协同过滤和大型语言模型的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤和大型语言模型的优势，以满足用户对自然语言查询和透明解释的期望。

Method: 将每个块的前馈网络拆分为单独的文本专家和项目专家，并使用token-type门控，以避免文本和目录模态之间的破坏性干扰。

Result: IDIOMoE在多个数据集上展示了强大的推荐性能，同时保持了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: IDIOMoE在公开和专有数据集上都表现出强大的推荐性能，同时保留了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

### [8] [Improving Metacognition and Uncertainty Communication in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05126)
*Mark Steyvers,Catarina Belem,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过监督微调提高大型语言模型传达不确定性的能力，并发现这种改进在不同任务和领域中具有一定的通用性，但不同元认知技能需要通过多任务训练共同开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在决策环境中越来越被使用，但当它们提供答案而不表明低置信度时，用户可能会无意中根据错误的输出采取行动。虽然以前的工作表明大型语言模型保持内部不确定性信号，但它们明确的口头置信度通常校准不当，并且在正确和错误答案之间区分能力较差。

Method: 我们对两种类型的大型语言模型进行了监督微调，并在涵盖一般知识、数学和开放性 trivia 的数据集上评估了两种元认知任务：(1) 单一问题置信度估计，其中模型为其答案分配一个数字确定性；(2) 成对置信度比较，其中模型选择两个答案中更可能正确的那个。

Result: 结果表明，微调提高了校准（陈述的置信度与准确性之间的对齐）和区分度（对正确答案的置信度更高），并且在不同领域内和跨领域都得到了改善，同时保持准确性不变。然而，改进是任务特定的：在单一问题校准上的训练不会转移到成对比较，反之亦然。相比之下，在两种元认知形式上进行多任务微调带来了更广泛的收益，在域外评估中产生了更低的校准误差和更强的区分度。

Conclusion: 结果表明，尽管大型语言模型中的不确定性沟通是可训练和可推广的，但不同的元认知技能不会自然地相互促进，必须通过多任务训练来共同开发。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

*Si-Ioi Ng,Pranav S. Ambadi,Kimberly D. Mueller,Julie Liss,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于BERT的管道，用于自动提取和排序图片描述中的内容信息单元，以评估认知语言损伤。该方法在多个指标上表现出色，并且在外部验证中优于基于字典的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法在通过图片描述进行认知语言损伤的自动化评估时，常常忽视视觉叙述路径。分析空间语义特征可以使用内容信息单元（CIUs）来捕捉这一路径，但手动标记或基于字典的映射是劳动密集型的。

Method: 提出了一种基于BERT的管道，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，以自动提取和排序Cookie Theft图片描述中的内容信息单元（CIUs）。

Result: 在5折交叉验证中，它在CIU检测中达到了93%的中位数精度和96%的中位数召回率，序列错误率为24%。所提出的方法提取的特征与真实数据有很强的皮尔逊相关性，在外部验证中超过了基于字典的基线。这些特征在通过ANCOVA评估组间差异时，表现与手动标注的特征相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地表征了视觉叙述路径，可用于认知障碍评估，并且实现了公开源代码和模型。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

*Qingshu Xu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Ming Li,Nan Zhang,Sydney Peters,Yanbin Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种自动化方法用于项目与内容标准的对齐，结果显示基于语言模型的方法优于集成学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的项目与内容标准对齐对于大规模评估中的有效分数解释至关重要。

Method: 本研究评估了三种自动化范式：首先，提取嵌入并训练多种经典的监督机器学习模型，并进一步研究了维度减少对模型性能的影响；其次，微调八种BERT模型及其变体进行领域和技能对齐；第三，探索了多数投票和堆叠的集成学习方法。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐中获得了最高的加权平均F1分数0.950，而RoBERTa-large在技能对齐中获得了最高的F1分数0.869。集成模型并未超越表现最好的语言模型。维度减少增强了基于嵌入的线性分类器，但不如语言模型表现好。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了不同的自动化项目对内容标准的对齐方法，结果表明基于语言模型的方法在性能上优于集成学习方法。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

### [11] [Submodular Context Partitioning and Compression for In-Context Learning-short paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05130)
*Shaoyi Zheng,Canyu Zhang,Tianyi Zhou,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Sub-CP的块感知上下文选择框架，通过利用子模目标来控制块的多样性，从而提高In-context learning的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效ICL方法在处理上下文时往往忽略信息冗余或不同划分策略导致的表示不足，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种块感知的上下文选择框架Sub-CP，利用子模目标来控制块的多样性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Sub-CP在各种任务中都能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Sub-CP consistently improves performance across model scales.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

*Bowen Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合语义搜索系统，以解决Head Start项目中员工在GoEngage平台上查找任务模块时遇到的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head Start项目使用GoEngage面临新员工或轮岗员工难以在平台主页上找到合适的任务模块的问题。这些问题源于领域特定的术语、系统特定的命名以及词汇搜索在处理拼写错误和不同词序方面的固有局限性。

Method: 我们提出了一种实用的混合语义搜索系统，结合了轻量级容错词汇检索、基于嵌入的向量相似性以及受约束的大语言模型（LLM）重新排序。

Result: 我们的方法利用了组织现有的任务仓库和知识库基础设施，同时通过低误报率确保可信度，适应术语变化的可扩展性，以及通过智能缓存、短名单生成和优雅降级机制实现经济效率。

Conclusion: 我们提供了一个全面的框架，详细说明了所需资源、分阶段实施策略以及离线评估协议，并通过在线测量方法验证了系统的有效性。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

### [13] [Training Large Language Models To Reason In Parallel With Global Forking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05132)
*Sheng Jia,Xiao Wang,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法，称为Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT)，通过引入基于集合的全局损失来改善LLMs在并行推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在复杂问题中，触发多样且正确推理模式的分叉标记通常位于采样树的深处，因此常见的鼓励多样性的策略（如温度缩放）在多样性与准确性之间出现了更糟糕的权衡。

Method: 我们将并行推理视为一个下一token预测问题，并使用自监督双射匹配将全局分叉标记与独特的推理轨迹相结合，引入基于集合的全局损失到监督微调（SFT）中。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSFT能够保持这些推理模式，并产生出现的全局分叉标记。

Conclusion: 实验表明，SSFT在多个推理基准测试中，在Pass@1和Cons@k指标下均优于SFT。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了合成数据比例对模型表现的影响，发现模型在20%以下合成数据时表现稳定，超过30%时性能下降加速，并提供了实用的合成数据预算指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管合成数据在现代NLP训练流程中变得至关重要，但对合成数据比例如何影响模型行为的理解仍然有限。

Method: 本文进行了一项受控的实证研究，评估了在不同合成数据与外部数据比例下模型的表现、校准和输出特征。

Result: 模型在最多20%的合成数据下保持稳定性能，但超过30%时性能下降加速；大模型（6.9B-12B）比小模型（410M-1.4B）更具鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确率损失，提供早期预警信号；任务特性影响结果，推理任务在合成数据训练下退化更快。

Conclusion: 本文提供了关于合成数据比例对模型行为影响的实用指导，并表明当前最佳实践在安全范围内运行。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型在客观任务上表现优异，但在评估创造力这种主观性任务时表现不佳。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于好奇心的LLM-as-a-judge方法，用于评估创意写作，并针对每个个体的创意判断进行个性化。

Result: 我们的方法使不同大小的模型能够学习不同个体的细微创意判断，并在各种评估指标上优于基线监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在主观评估中特别有用，特别是在标注者之间不一致的情况下。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

*Luka Terčon,Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了AI生成文本的语言特征研究，指出AI生成文本倾向于更正式和非个人化的风格，并强调需要更多的跨语言和跨模型研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI生成文本的日益普及，研究其语言特征变得越来越重要。尽管已有许多观察结果，但仍需要更广泛的综合研究以更好地理解该主题。

Method: 本文对现有研究进行了分类，包括语言描述的层次、包含的模型、分析的体裁、分析的语言以及提示的方法。同时，使用相同的框架来呈现目前的发现并揭示研究人员当前的趋势。

Result: AI生成的文本更可能包含更正式和非个人化的风格，表现为名词、限定词和介词的增加以及形容词和副词的减少。AI生成的文本还更可能具有较低的词汇多样性、较小的词汇量和重复文本。

Conclusion: 当前研究仍主要集中在英语数据和GPT模型家族生成的文本上，这突显了需要进行更广泛的跨语言和跨模型研究。此外，作者通常未能解决提示敏感性问题，为未来研究提供了大量空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了WebDetective，这是一个无提示的多跳问题基准，配有一个受控的Wikipedia沙箱，以及一个全面的评估框架，用于分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为。评估25个最先进的模型显示，它们在知识利用方面存在系统性弱点，并且在缺乏证据时几乎无法做出适当的拒绝。因此，作者开发了一个代理工作流EvidenceLoop，旨在解决这些问题，并展示了WebDetective的诊断框架可以指导具体的架构改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的实践存在两个主要限制：首先，大多数基准测试在问题文本中泄露了推理路径，允许模型跟随表面线索而不是自主发现推理链。其次，评估通常被简化为单次通过率，这将多样行为压缩成一个分数，并掩盖了失败是由于搜索不足、知识使用不佳还是不适当的拒绝。为了克服这些问题，我们提出了WebDetective，这是一个无提示的多跳问题基准，配有一个受控的Wikipedia沙箱，确保模型行为的完整可追溯性，并提供一个全面的评估框架，将搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为分开。

Method: 我们提出了WebDetective，这是一个无提示的多跳问题基准，配有一个受控的Wikipedia沙箱，确保模型行为的完整可追溯性，并提供一个全面的评估框架，将搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为分开。我们还开发了一个代理工作流EvidenceLoop，明确针对我们基准所识别的挑战，结合验证循环和系统的证据跟踪，以提高搜索和综合能力。

Result: 我们对25个最先进的模型进行了评估，结果显示系统性弱点：模型在拥有足够证据的情况下仍然难以利用知识，并且在缺乏证据时几乎无法做出适当的拒绝。这些模式揭示了一个根本性的差距：当前系统擅长执行给定的推理路径，但在需要发现它们时却失败了。EvidenceLoop工作流通过结合验证循环和系统性的证据跟踪，提高了搜索和综合能力，证明了WebDetective的诊断框架可以指导具体的架构改进。

Conclusion: 我们的评估显示，25个最先进的模型在所有架构中都存在系统性弱点：尽管有足够的证据，模型在知识利用方面仍然困难，并且在缺乏证据时表现出几乎不存在的适当拒绝行为。这些模式暴露了一个根本性的差距：当前的系统擅长执行给定的推理路径，但在需要发现它们时却失败了。我们开发了一个代理工作流EvidenceLoop，明确针对我们基准所识别的挑战，结合验证循环和系统的证据跟踪，提高了搜索和综合能力。这个基线表明，WebDetective的诊断框架可以指导具体的架构改进，将我们的基准确立为开发真正自主推理系统的关键工具，而不是遵循模式的代理。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多代理协作工作流LiRA，用于自动化科学写作，以提高系统综述的可靠性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于科学出版物的快速增长，保持文献综述的全面性和及时性变得越来越困难。尽管之前的工作集中在自动化检索和筛选上，但系统综述的写作阶段仍然研究不足，尤其是在可读性和事实准确性方面。

Method: 我们提出了LiRA（文献综述代理），这是一个多代理协作工作流，模拟人类文献综述过程。LiRA利用专门的代理进行内容大纲、子部分写作、编辑和评审，生成连贯且全面的综述文章。

Result: 在SciReviewGen和一个专有的ScienceDirect数据集上评估，LiRA在写作和引用质量方面优于当前基线如AutoSurvey和MASS-Survey，同时与人工撰写的综述保持竞争力。我们进一步在实际场景中使用文档检索评估LiRA，并评估其对评审者模型变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，即使没有领域特定的微调，代理式LLM工作流也有潜力提高自动化科学写作的可靠性和可用性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

Motivation: 为了评估语言模型生成准确且简洁源代码描述的能力，需要一种系统性的方法来进行公平和一致的评估。

Method: 提出了一种系统性的NLP框架NLD-LLM，结合了多种Transformer模型，并采用全面的提示设计策略和迭代优化过程来提高输出质量。

Result: 通过语义和结构指标分析，证明了提示工程对模型效果有显著影响，小模型在良好提示支持下表现优异。

Conclusion: NLD-LLM框架能够有效评估语言模型生成准确且简洁的源代码描述的能力，研究表明提示工程对模型效果有显著影响，小模型在良好提示支持下也能表现优异。

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

Method: 本文通过分析大语言模型在预测人类阅读行为方面的表现，探讨了其'超人类'特性的原因，并提出了改进方向和实验建议。

Result: 研究发现，大语言模型在预测人类阅读行为方面的能力下降，主要是因为它们的长期和短期记忆能力超过了人类。

Conclusion: 本文认为，当前的大语言模型在语言理解方面表现出'超人类'的特性，主要是由于它们具有比人类更强的长期记忆和短期记忆。作者主张创建具有类人记忆的模型，并提出了一些可能的方向。最后，作者指出目前可用的人类数据不足以衡量这一目标的进展，并提出了可以填补这一差距的人类实验。

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的多阶段信息提取管道，用于从实验报告的材料中提取47个特征。该方法通过迭代提取和源跟踪提高了准确性和可靠性，在显微组织类别上显著提升了F1分数，并减少了遗漏材料的数量。该管道实现了可扩展和高效的文献挖掘，生成了高精度、极少遗漏且无假阳性结果的数据库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的材料发现需要大规模的实验数据集，但大部分信息仍被困在非结构化文献中。现有的提取工作通常只关注有限的特征，没有解决集成的成分-加工-显微组织-性能关系，这给构建全面数据库带来了挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一种多阶段信息提取管道，利用大语言模型从实验报告的材料中捕获47个特征，包括成分、加工、显微组织和性能。该管道整合了迭代提取和源跟踪以提高准确性和可靠性。

Result: 在特征级别（独立属性）和元组级别（相互依赖的特征）的评估中，F1分数约为0.96。与没有源跟踪的单次提取相比，我们的方法在显微组织类别上的F1分数提高了10.0%（特征级别）和13.7%（元组级别），并将396种材料中的遗漏材料从49减少到13。

Conclusion: 该管道实现了可扩展和高效的文献挖掘，生成了高精度、极少遗漏且无假阳性结果的数据库。这些数据集为机器学习和材料信息学提供了可信输入，并且模块化设计可以推广到各种材料类别，实现了全面的材料信息提取。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的机器翻译关键错误检测数据集 SynCED-EnDe，具有平衡的标签和丰富的错误分类，适用于更深入的错误分析和系统研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 WMT21 英德 CED 数据集在规模、标签平衡、领域覆盖和时间新鲜度方面存在局限。因此，需要一个新的资源来支持更全面的错误检测研究。

Method: 本文介绍了 SynCED-EnDe 数据集，该数据集包含 1,000 个黄金标注和 8,000 个银色标注的句子对，平衡地分为错误和非错误案例。它从 2024-2025 年的多样化来源（如 StackExchange、GOV.UK）中获取，并引入了明确的错误子类、结构化的触发标志以及细粒度的辅助判断（明显性、严重性、定位复杂性、上下文依赖性、充分性偏差）。

Result: 基准实验表明，与 WMT21 相比，XLM-R 和相关编码器在平衡标签和细化注释的基础上表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe 被视为一种社区资源，旨在推动机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手中的安全部署，特别是在可穿戴人工智能设备等新兴情境中。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

Motivation: 由于dLLMs的解码机制具有快速推理速度和强大的性能，因此研究其解码机制在模型归因中的应用具有重要意义。

Method: 本文提出了两种关键问题：从解码轨迹中提取什么信息以及如何有效利用它。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了Directed Decoding Map (DDM) 和 Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA) 方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文提出的方法在不同设置下都表现出良好的效果，能够有效地进行模型归因。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于离散扩散语言模型（dLLMs）的解码机制进行模型归因的方法，展示了其在模型识别和不同检查点区分中的有效性。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Chronological Thinking, a mechanism for full-duplex spoken dialogue language models that improves response quality by enabling incremental reasoning during listening without additional latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems keep the agent idle by repeatedly predicting the silence token during the listening phase, which departs from human behavior where we engage in lightweight thinking during conversation.

Method: Chronological Thinking is introduced as a on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead, and amortizes reasoning during the listening window.

Result: Experiments show that chronological thinking improves response quality through both objective metrics and human evaluations, and it robustly handles conversational dynamics with competitive performance on full-duplex interaction metrics.

Conclusion: Chronological thinking demonstrates effectiveness in improving response quality in full-duplex SDLMs and shows robustness in handling conversational dynamics.

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Motivation: 金融应用对准确性、可靠性和领域适应性有严格要求，因此需要深入研究领域适应的大型语言模型（LLM）在金融自然语言处理（NLP）中的优缺点。

Method: 本研究分析了FinMA模型的架构，以及利用金融指令调优（FIT）数据集进行的指令调优过程，并在FLARE基准下进行了评估。

Result: FinMA在情感分析和分类任务中表现良好，但在涉及数值推理、实体识别和摘要的任务中面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在加深对如何有效设计和评估金融语言模型的理解，以帮助金融相关的决策过程。

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large

(NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU
framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial
tasks. Recognizing the critical demands of accuracy, reliability, and domain
adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial
Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and its evaluation under the FLARE benchmark.
Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and
classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical
reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the
understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated
to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

Method: 本文通过实验研究了不同分隔符对LLM性能的影响，并通过分析注意力头得分来探究其原因。

Result: 实验结果显示，不同分隔符可能导致模型性能变化高达±23%。此外，模型的脆弱性在不同主题和模型家族中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，LLM对分隔符的选择非常敏感，这可能影响模型的性能和排名。通过在提示中指定选定的分隔符可以提高鲁棒性，并提供了最佳分隔符选择的实用建议。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

Motivation: 现有的 LLM 作为评判者在大规模评估中表现出与人类判断不一致的问题，需要一种更准确的评估方法。

Method: 本文介绍了 DeliberationBank 数据集和 DeliberationJudge 模型，用于评估 deliberation 汇总的效果。

Result: 通过 DeliberationJudge 评估了 18 个 LLM，并揭示了在 deliberation 汇总中的持续弱点，尤其是少数群体立场的代表性不足。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个可扩展且可靠的方法来评估 deliberation summarization，有助于确保 AI 系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在引入一种新的方法，用于自动检测大型语言模型（LLM）推理过程中生成的幻觉。

Method: 该方法基于一个系统的分类法和通过提示工程对各种幻觉类型的受控再现。然后使用嵌入模型将专门的幻觉数据集映射到向量空间，并在减少维度的幻觉表示中使用无监督学习技术进行分析。

Result: 定量评估显示，信息失真程度与幻觉与正确输出集群的空间偏离之间存在一致的相关性。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了理论和实证证据，表明即使是简单的分类算法也可以在单个LLM内可靠地区分幻觉和准确的回答，从而提供了一个轻量级但有效的框架来提高模型的可靠性。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

### [29] [Let it Calm: Exploratory Annealed Decoding for Verifiable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05251)
*Chenghao Yang,Lin Gui,Chenxiao Yang,Victor Veitch,Lizhu Zhang,Zhuokai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Exploratory Annealed Decoding（EAD）的探索策略，通过在生成过程中动态调整采样温度，实现了前期探索和后期利用的平衡，从而提高了样本效率并改善了训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）是一种增强大型语言模型（LLMs）推理能力的强大范式，但其成功取决于有效的探索。理想的探索策略必须在保持样本质量的同时确保训练稳定性。然而，标准的固定温度采样难以平衡这些相互竞争的需求，因为高温会降低样本质量，而低温会限制发现。

Method: 我们提出了一个更简单有效的策略，即探索性退火解码（EAD），其基础是探索在早期标记上最为重要，这些标记决定了序列的语义方向。EAD通过在生成过程中将采样温度从高到低进行退火来实现一种直观的“前期探索，后期利用”策略。

Result: 我们证明EAD是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，显著提高了样本效率，在各种RLVR算法和模型规模上始终优于固定温度采样。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，将探索与序列生成的自然动力学对齐为改进LLM推理提供了一条稳健的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入了Camellia基准测试，用于测量九种亚洲语言中的文化偏见，并评估了四种最近的多语言LLM家族在各种任务中的文化偏见。结果表明，LLMs在文化适应性方面存在困难，不同LLM家族表现出不同的文化偏见，并且在实体提取任务中存在文化间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言基准测试，不清楚这些偏见是否也出现在不同的非西方语言中。因此，本文旨在引入一个基准测试来测量亚洲语言中的文化偏见。

Method: 本文引入了Camellia基准测试，用于测量九种亚洲语言中的以实体为中心的文化偏见，并评估了四种最近的多语言LLM家族在各种任务中的文化偏见。

Result: 分析结果显示，LLMs在所有亚洲语言中的文化适应性方面存在困难，不同模型在不同地区开发时对文化相关数据的访问情况不同，导致性能差异。此外，不同LLM家族表现出不同的文化偏见，并且在实体提取任务中存在文化间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，LLMs在处理亚洲语言的文化适应性方面存在困难，不同LLM家族表现出不同的文化偏见，并且在实体提取任务中存在文化间的性能差距。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

*Yining She,Daniel W. Peterson,Marianne Menglin Liu,Vikas Upadhyay,Mohammad Hossein Chaghazardi,Eunsuk Kang,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于大型语言模型的防护机制在面对额外信息时的鲁棒性，发现它们在某些情况下不可靠，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，确保其安全性变得至关重要。外部基于LLM的防护模型虽然流行，但它们容易受到数据分布变化的影响，因此需要研究其鲁棒性。

Method: 以检索增强生成（RAG）为例，对3个Llama Guards和2个GPT-oss模型进行了系统评估，分析了增强上下文中各个组件的影响，并测试了两种缓解方法的效果。

Result: 在约11%和8%的情况下，将良性文档插入防护模型的上下文会改变输入和输出防护模型的判断，使其不可靠。测试的两种缓解方法仅带来轻微改进。

Conclusion: 当前的基于大型语言模型的防护机制在面对检索和查询组合时存在上下文鲁棒性差距，需要建立更稳健的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了WeatherArchive-Bench，这是一个用于评估检索增强生成系统在历史天气档案上的基准。实验结果表明，密集检索器在处理历史术语时表现不佳，而大型语言模型在理解脆弱性和恢复力概念时也存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史天气档案提供了关于社会如何经历和应对极端天气事件的丰富、未开发的叙述，但它们的规模庞大、数字化质量差以及古语使它们难以转化为结构化的知识。

Method: 引入WeatherArchive-Bench，这是第一个用于评估检索增强生成（RAG）系统在历史天气档案上的基准。该基准包括两个任务：WeatherArchive-Retrieval和WeatherArchive-Assessment。

Result: 密集检索器在历史术语上经常失败，而大型语言模型（LLMs）经常误解脆弱性和恢复力概念。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在复杂社会指标上推理的关键限制，并为从档案背景设计更稳健的气候相关RAG系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/WeatherArchive-Bench/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法Residualized Similarity (RS)，用于改进作者验证系统的性能，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者验证系统需要高准确性和可解释性，而神经方法虽然准确性高，但缺乏直接的可解释性。此外，大型语言模型的预测无法被忠实解释。因此，需要一种既能提高性能又能保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 本文引入了Residualized Similarity (RS)方法，该方法通过神经网络预测相似性残差，即可解释系统预测的相似性误差，从而提升系统的性能并保持可解释性。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅能够达到最先进的作者验证模型的性能，还能展示最终预测的可信度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的方法Residualized Similarity (RS)，它可以补充使用可解释特征的系统，同时保持可解释性。实验表明，该方法不仅能够达到最先进的作者验证模型的性能，还能展示最终预测的可信度和可解释性。

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Transformer模型的注意力机制具有二次复杂度，随着上下文长度的增加，这成为一个显著的瓶颈。因此，需要探索其他方法来克服这一问题。

Method: 本文对最近的注意力变体、循环神经网络、状态空间模型和混合架构进行了综述和批判性分析。

Result: 本文分析了各种方法在计算和内存复杂度、基准结果和基本限制方面的表现。

Conclusion: 本文分析了近年来为克服纯注意力Transformer模型的瓶颈所做的努力，并评估了这些方法是否可能挑战纯注意力Transformer的主导地位。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现输入长度本身可能会影响LLM性能，即使检索是完美的。为此，提出了一个简单的缓解策略，通过让模型在解决问题前复述检索到的证据来改善表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前的研究认为长上下文任务中性能下降是由于检索失败，但本文旨在探索输入长度本身是否会对LLM性能产生负面影响，即使检索是完美的。

Method: 本文通过系统实验对5个开源和闭源的LLM进行了研究，分析了在数学、问答和编码任务中，当模型能够完美检索所有相关信息时，输入长度增加对性能的影响。此外，还测试了在无关标记被替换为最小干扰的空白符或全部遮蔽的情况下，模型的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使模型能够完美检索相关信息，输入长度增加仍会导致性能显著下降（13.9%--85%）。此外，在无关标记被替换或遮蔽后，以及将相关证据放在问题前时，同样观察到了性能下降。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了输入长度本身可能会损害大型语言模型（LLMs）的性能，而与检索质量和无关信息无关。为此，我们提出了一种简单且模型无关的缓解策略，通过提示模型在尝试解决问题之前复述检索到的证据，将长上下文任务转换为短上下文任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度的心理健康沟通在语言上是碎片化的，文化上是多样化的，并且在临床NLP中经常被忽视。当前的健康本体论和心理健康资源主要由以英语或西方文化为中心的诊断框架主导，这导致了在印度语言中无法准确代表患者的痛苦表达。

Method: 我们提出了跨语言的患者压力表达图（CL-PDE），这是一种通过基于图的方法构建跨语言心理健康本体论的框架，捕捉文化嵌入的压力表达，将它们跨语言对齐，并与临床术语关联。

Result: 我们的方法通过将AI系统扎根于文化上有效的表示，解决了医疗沟通中的关键差距，使多语言环境下的心理健康护理能够拥有更包容和以患者为中心的NLP工具。

Conclusion: 我们的方法通过将AI系统扎根于文化上有效的表示，解决了医疗沟通中的关键差距，使多语言环境下的心理健康护理能够拥有更包容和以患者为中心的NLP工具。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究应用直接偏好优化（DPO）来改进心力衰竭护理记录的质量，通过使用大量数据和专家验证的偏好对来训练语言模型，结果表明DPO显著提升了文档质量，并有助于实现隐私保护的AI辅助文档编写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 护理记录在重症监护病房（ICUs）中提供关键的临床智能，但常常存在术语不一致、风格非正式和缺乏标准化的问题，这些问题在心力衰竭护理中尤其关键。

Method: 本研究应用了直接偏好优化（DPO）来调整Mistral-7B，这是一个本地可部署的语言模型，使用了来自MIMIC-III数据库的8,838份心力衰竭护理记录和21,210对由专家验证的GPT输出、模型生成和原始记录组成的偏好对。

Result: 评估结果显示，DPO显著提高了文档质量。具体来说，BLEU增加了84%（0.173到0.318），BERTScore提高了7.6%（0.828到0.891），专家评分在准确性、完整性、逻辑一致性、可读性和结构清晰度方面都有所提高。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，DPO可以将轻量级临床语言模型与专家标准对齐，支持在电子健康记录系统中进行隐私保护的AI辅助文档编写，以减少行政负担并提高ICU患者安全。

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在结构工程中的潜力，特别是在需要几何建模、复杂推理和领域知识的有限元建模任务中。

Method: 开发了一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，用于自动化二维框架的有限元建模。系统将结构分析分解为子任务，每个任务由一个由轻量级Llama-3.3 70B Instruct模型驱动的专业智能体管理。

Result: 实验评估表明，该系统在10次重复试验中在20个基准问题上实现了超过80%的准确性。

Conclusion: 该系统在大多数情况下实现了超过80%的准确性，并优于Gemini-2.5 Pro和ChatGPT-4o模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，利用大型语言模型生成的推理作为信任信号，提高了专利分类的准确性、稳定性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的推理常常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域特定的不一致，直接将其作为监督可能导致噪声传播和训练不稳定。因此，需要一种更可靠的方法来利用这些推理。

Method: 本文提出了三种无监督的信任度量：(1) 自一致性，(2) 类蕴含对齐，(3) 大型语言模型同意评分，并将它们整合成一个统一的信任分数，以指导选择性蒸馏。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集上的实验表明，本文方法在准确性、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Self-Filtered Distillation的框架，用于专利分类，通过利用大型语言模型生成的推理作为信任信号而非真实监督，提高了准确性、稳定性和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

*Yao Dou,Michel Galley,Baolin Peng,Chris Kedzie,Weixin Cai,Alan Ritter,Chris Quirk,Wei Xu,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimulatorArena, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based simulators of human users, and shows that simulators conditioned on user profiles can effectively replace human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluation is costly, time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, so the paper aims to explore whether LLMs can simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation.

Method: The paper introduces SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two interactive tasks, and evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments.

Result: Simulators conditioned on user profiles align closely with human judgments, achieving a Spearman's ρ of 0.7 on both tasks. The best simulators were used to benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs.

Conclusion: Simulators conditioned on user profiles can serve as a practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation in assessing LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

TL;DR: 本文提出了tAgentRouter框架，通过知识图谱引导的路由方法，利用图神经网络进行任务感知的代理路由，从而提升问答任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同代理和骨干模型展现出互补的优势，且更大的模型并不总是更优，因此需要自适应的路由机制。然而，现有的代理路由方法往往侧重于成本效率，而忽视了QA任务中固有的细粒度上下文和关系结构。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为tAgentRouter的框架，将多代理问答问题转化为由知识图谱引导的路由问题，并通过经验性能信号进行监督。具体来说，将QA实例转换为包含查询、上下文实体和代理的知识图谱，并训练异构图神经网络（GNN）在节点类型之间传播信息，生成针对任务的代理路由分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文的框架在多个基准和LLM后端上 consistently 超过单代理和集成基线，展示了其有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的tAgentRouter框架在问答任务中展示了有效性和鲁棒性，通过图监督的多代理路由方法，能够捕捉不同代理的互补优势，并在多个基准和LLM后端上表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言和推理模型在理解对话中的复杂社会现象方面存在不足，因此需要一个新的数据集来评估这些模型的弱点并找到解决方案。

Method: 本文引入了SocialNLI数据集，并通过多步骤的反事实推理评估了LLM和推理模型的理论心智能力。

Result: SocialNLI数据集包含了精心挑选的对话转录本，其中心是复杂的社交细微差别，如讽刺和反语，并配以推论、相应的可能性分数和人类编写的解释。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了SocialNLI（SoNLI）数据集，用于评估大型语言和推理模型在理解复杂社会现象如讽刺和反语方面的能力。

Abstract: Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of
a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI
assistants. However, large language and reasoning models struggle to understand
sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony.
To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and
reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual
reasoning.

TL;DR: TensorBLEU是一种针对GPU加速的BLEU度量实现，能够显著提高计算速度并减少内存消耗，适用于大规模模型的训练和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代自然语言处理模型的评估工具常常成为计算瓶颈，尤其是在训练过程中需要高效运行的指标，如强化学习中的每句奖励信号。

Method: TensorBLEU是专门为GPU上的批量token ID计算设计的BLEU度量的新实现，采用完全向量化的方法，并引入了内存高效的计数机制。

Result: TensorBLEU在消费级GPU（NVIDIA T4）上实现了超过13倍的速度提升，在数据中心级硬件（NVIDIA A100）上超过了40倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: TensorBLEU将显著的瓶颈转化为训练循环中的微不足道部分，并为基于RL的模型微调等研究领域提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的动机是解决当前LLM在规划任务中的性能可能被高估的问题，以及在下游任务中的安全问题。

Method: 本文的方法是在广泛使用的规划基准中添加手动注释的细粒度和丰富的自然语言约束，并在多个状态最先进的推理LLM、形式语言、方法和数据集上进行了测试。

Result: 本文的结果显示，引入约束不仅使性能减半，还显著挑战了对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，引入约束不仅显著降低了性能，还极大地挑战了对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LANTERN is a novel LLM knowledge distillation framework tailored for job person fit tasks. It improves task specific metrics and shows measurable gains in job seeker engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs at scale for domain specific applications introduces distinct challenges. Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for online use.

Method: LANTERN is a novel LLM knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit tasks. It involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. It incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that integrates both data and logit level insights.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a 0.24% increase in apply rate and a 0.28% increase in qualified applications.

Conclusion: LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

*Ceyhun Efe Kayan,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需指令的推理增强方法，称为基于原型的动态引导（PDS），该方法通过聚类激活差异来形成推理原型，并在推理时生成实例特定的引导向量，从而在多个任务上提升了LLM的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM具有广泛的性能，但它们仍然依赖于显式的推理指令或静态的、一刀切的引导方法，这留下了自适应、无需指令的推理增强的空白。

Method: 我们介绍了“推理原型”，通过聚类Chain-of-Thought (CoT)和中性提示之间的激活差异来形成。在推理时，输入的隐藏状态被投影到这些原型上以形成实例特定的引导向量。

Result: 在GSM8K、AQuA-RAT和BIG-Bench任务上评估，PDS始终提高了准确性，而无需微调或提示工程。值得注意的是，当显式抑制CoT以提高成本效益时，收益仍然存在，这表明干预增强了潜在的推理过程，而不是诱导表面的行为变化。

Conclusion: 这些结果将动态、基于原型的引导定位为一种轻量级替代方案，用于在训练时间增强LLM推理。

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在处理长文档时面临信息量过大的挑战，需要一种连贯的记忆模块来提升其自主阅读能力。然而，目前缺乏系统的设计原则。

Method: 本文借鉴了让·皮亚杰的建构主义理论，提出了结构化图式、灵活同化和动态顺应三个特性，并开发了CAM原型实现这些特性。

Result: CAM在多种长文本阅读理解任务中，如问答、基于查询的摘要和声明验证，相比现有方法在性能和效率上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于建构主义理论的自主记忆模块CAM，它在长文本阅读理解任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

Motivation: 在安全关键环境中使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行领域特定的知识提取和推理。

Method: KEO构建了一个结构化的知识图（KG），并将其集成到检索增强生成（RAG）管道中，以实现比传统文本块RAG更连贯、数据集范围内的推理。

Result: KEO显著提高了全局理解能力，揭示了模式和系统级见解，而文本块RAG对于需要本地检索的细粒度程序任务仍然有效。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了KG增强型LLMs在安全、领域特定QA中的潜力，以及其在高风险推理中的前景。

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

TL;DR: H1B-KV 是一种全面的压缩方案，通过 1 位二进制草图和 4 位量化显著减少内存使用，同时保持上下文完整性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法如量化缓存、驱逐令牌或使用二进制草图对于键（例如 Loki）往往提供不完整的解决方案，因为它们可能未压缩某个组件（如值）或丢弃上下文信息。

Method: H1B-KV 通过使用 1 位二进制草图表示每个键向量，并使用 4 位量化压缩值向量，实现了一种全面的压缩方案。

Result: H1B-KV 使一个 70 亿参数的 LLM 能够在不到 60 MB 的缓存内存下处理 8k 个标记的上下文，减少了 70 倍。经过轻量微调后，H1B-KV 在困惑度基准测试以及数学推理、多任务理解和代码生成等复杂下游任务中与全精度性能相当。

Conclusion: H1B-KV 是一种在内存受限环境中部署大型语言模型的稳健解决方案，显著优于现有的量化、令牌驱逐和仅键草图方法。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

Result: 困难提示在自对弈优化中表现较差，增加困难提示会略微降低整体性能。随着模型容量的增加，困难提示和简单提示之间的性能差距会缩小。选择性移除困难提示可以提升自对弈性能。

Conclusion: 本文发现困难提示在自对弈偏好优化中表现较差，且增加困难提示会略微降低整体性能。随着模型容量的增加，困难提示和简单提示之间的性能差距会缩小。通过选择性移除部分困难提示，可以提升自对弈性能。

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

Motivation: 现有的方法在处理开放领域问题时往往遇到困难，因为它们依赖于固定的行动序列，而开放领域问题需要大量的信息检索。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了FGDIP，以增强LLMs在开放领域多跳推理任务中的推理能力。

Method: 我们提出了Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP)，一种新的框架，通过利用动态和自适应策略来增强LLMs在开放领域多跳推理任务中的推理能力。我们的方法首先识别与问题相关的关键实体，这些实体作为推理过程的初始节点。从这些初始节点开始，我们生成推理子节点，该过程通过历史错误分析和实时反馈相结合进行优化，使框架能够动态调整和优化其推理策略。通过将深度优先搜索与创新的节点生成技术相结合，我们的框架基于先前的错误路径和同时生成的同一层级节点进行适应。这种动态策略有效地扩展了搜索空间，同时确保推理过程系统地收敛到准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EAGLET，一种高效有效的规划器训练方法，以增强基于大型语言模型的代理的规划能力。实验表明，配备该规划器的执行者代理在长时任务中表现优于现有方法，且训练成本显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的代理在长时任务中由于缺乏全局规划而难以进行无脑的试错和生成幻觉动作。本文旨在引入一种计划和执行框架，并提出EAGLET，一种高效有效的规划器训练方法，以增强执行者代理的规划能力而无需人工努力。

Method: 我们通过一个两步过程训练一个可插拔的全局规划器：首先使用我们提出的同源共识过滤策略从先进的LLM中合成高质量的计划，并应用微调作为冷启动。此外，我们进一步通过使用新颖的执行者能力增益奖励的基于规则的强化学习阶段来改进规划器，确保它可以处理不同难度的任务指令。

Result: 在三个长时任务代理上进行的实验表明，配备我们规划器的执行者代理优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进性能。同时，EAGLET相比基于RL的基线减少了8倍的训练成本，并且不需要人工努力或额外的训练数据，提供了一种高效有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training
data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating

artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external

wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

TL;DR: This paper explores the sparsity of parameters in MoE models and proposes MoNE, a method for neuron-granular expert selection that improves parameter utilization and inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We observed that most neuron activations are near zero, which motivates us to select only high-activation neuron experts during pretraining.

Method: We propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE) which achieves neuron-granular expert selection by applying a simple top-k selection within each expert.

Result: MoNE matches traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at equal numbers of activated parameters.

Conclusion: MoNE is a practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency in MoE-like models.

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

Conclusion: TKTO improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%, automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance

utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO

TL;DR: EEPO is a novel framework that enhances exploration in RLVR for LLMs by using a sample-then-forget mechanism, resulting in improved performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods overemphasize exploitation, leading to entropy collapse and limited performance gains. Techniques that increase policy stochasticity often fail to escape dominant behavioral modes, creating a self-reinforcing loop.

Method: EEPO introduces a two-stage rollout framework with adaptive unlearning to promote exploration by temporarily suppressing previously sampled responses.

Result: EEPO achieves average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base across five reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: EEPO outperforms GRPO across multiple reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major
languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models
(SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance
in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

TL;DR: 本文研究了长上下文模型在处理长序列时的局限性，并提出了一种新的训练策略来提升模型对关键信息的关注度和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在解决长上下文模型（LCMs）在处理长序列时容易受到无关标记干扰的问题，以提高模型对关键信息的关注度和预测性能。

Method: 本文提出了一个有效的指标，即Integrated Gradient (IG)分数，用于检测和量化上下文中的噪声信息，并基于此提出了Context Denoising Training (CDT)的训练策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过CDT训练的模型在多个任务中表现出色，尤其是在长上下文设置下，其性能接近甚至超过了一些先进的模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Context Denoising Training (CDT)的训练策略，该策略能够提高模型对关键标记的关注度并增强其对模型预测的影响。实验结果表明，使用CDT训练的开源8B模型可以达到与GPT-4o相当的性能。

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

*Faeze Ghorbanpour,Alexander Fraser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在长上下文中对有害内容的敏感性，发现性能在中等有害内容普遍性时最佳，但随着上下文长度增加，召回率下降，且明确内容更容易被识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在安全关键场景中的行为，特别是其对有害内容的敏感性。

Method: 我们评估了LLM在扩展上下文中对有害内容的敏感性，变化类型（明确 vs. 隐含）、位置（开始、中间、结束）、普遍性（0.01-0.50的提示）和上下文长度（600-6000个标记）。

Result: 性能在中等有害普遍性（0.25）时达到峰值，但当内容非常稀疏或占主导地位时会下降；随着上下文长度增加，召回率下降；开头的有害句子通常更容易被检测到；明确内容比隐含内容更一致地被识别。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对LLM如何在长上下文中优先和校准有害内容的第一个系统视图，突显了它们的新兴优势以及在安全关键使用中仍存在的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support applications that rely on
extended context, from document processing to retrieval-augmented generation.
While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and
retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在质疑LSZ关于大型语言模型在不同语言提示下表现出文化特性的主张，并指出其研究中的问题。

Method: 本文对LSZ的方法、理论框架和结论进行了批判性重新评估，并通过使用更广泛的LLM和更多的测试项目进行了针对性复制实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，提示语言对输出的影响很小，这与LSZ声称这些模型编码了基于现实的文化信念相矛盾。

Conclusion: LSZ的结论是错误的，因为他们在实验方法、理论框架和结论上存在问题。他们观察到的文化倾向并不是稳定特征，而是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物。

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种自然语言处理任务中取得了显著成功，但它们在多轮交互中仍然不理想，常常依赖于错误的早期假设，并且无法随时间跟踪用户目标，这使得这些任务特别具有挑战性。对话系统中的先前工作表明，长期规划对于处理交互任务至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个受强化学习启发的提示优化框架，通过仅修改基于LLM的代理的任务指令提示来实现长期规划。该方法在多轮任务中表现出显著改进，并且可以跨不同的LLM-based代理进行泛化。这为未来研究强化学习启发的无参数优化方法提供了依据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基准常常将文化简化为静态事实或同质价值观，这与人类学观点相冲突，因为人类学强调文化是动态的、历史背景的，并在实践中体现。

Method: 本文引入了一个四部分框架，用于分类基准如何呈现文化，例如知识、偏好、表现或偏见。使用这个视角，我们定性地检查了20个文化基准，并识别出六个常见的方法论问题。

Result: 我们发现了六个常见的方法论问题，包括将国家视为文化、忽视文化内部的多样性以及依赖简化的调查格式。

Conclusion: 本文旨在指导文化基准的开发，使其超越静态回忆任务，并更准确地捕捉模型对复杂文化情境的反应。

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型的道德一致性，并检测区域偏差。

Method: EvalMORAAL框架使用两种评分方法（对数概率和直接评分）以及模型作为评委的同行评审来评估20个大型语言模型的道德一致性。

Result: 顶级模型与调查结果高度一致（WVS的相关系数约为0.90），但发现明显的区域差异：西方地区的平均相关系数为0.82，非西方地区为0.61（绝对差距为0.21）。

Conclusion: 我们的框架展示了在文化敏感AI方面的实际进展，同时突出了跨地区使用的开放挑战。

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解大型语言模型内部评估问题难度的能力对于自适应推理和高效资源分配至关重要。

Method: 我们使用最终标记表示的线性探测来证明数学问题的难度水平可以被线性建模，并定位了最终Transformer层中的特定注意力头，这些注意力头对简单和困难问题有相反的激活模式。

Result: 我们的实验表明，大型语言模型可以内部编码问题难度，并且在标记级别上存在显著的熵和难度感知差异。此外，我们的实验为使用大型语言模型作为自动难度注释器提供了实际支持。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了大型语言模型中的难度感知不仅存在，而且具有结构化组织，为未来的研究提供了新的理论见解和实践方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在现实世界中部署LLM，其中遵守约束（特别是安全约束）至关重要，我们需要评估它们在约束规划任务上的表现。

Method: 我们引入了LexiCon——一个基于自然语言的（Lexi）约束（Con）规划基准，由一套环境组成，可以以系统的方式评估LLM的规划能力。核心思想是将现有的规划环境施加时间约束，并将这些约束问题翻译成自然语言，然后交给LLM解决。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLM在规划任务的约束程度增加时性能会下降。

Conclusion: 我们的实验表明，最先进的LLM（包括像GPT-5、o3和R1这样的推理模型）在规划任务的约束程度增加时性能会下降。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

Conclusion: 本文认为直接的最小对比较方法提供了更大的诊断透明度，并指出评估指标的选择对于评估LLM的句法能力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA由于仅依赖一个下投影矩阵（A）而存在表示瓶颈，无法捕捉复杂任务所需的多样信号，因此需要改进特征适应以提升下游任务适应能力。

Method: MASA采用多-A、单-B结构，通过异步共享多-A专家集来实现参数效率，并利用单-B矩阵集成多样化特征。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，MASA的平均准确率为59.62%，比标准LoRA高出1.08个百分点（相对改进1.84%），且学习参数相当。

Conclusion: MASA在多个任务和领域中表现出色，证明了其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a fundamental flaw in the Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already high-probability ones.

Method: ASPO uses a simple yet effective strategy that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining gradient flow.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence, improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong GRPO-based baselines.

Conclusion: ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence, improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong GRPO-based baselines. The analysis provides new insights into the role of token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of correcting IS in LLM RL.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Spectrum Tuning的后训练方法，通过使用Spectrum Suite来提高模型的可调节性和分布覆盖范围，并在保留数据集上改进了分布对齐。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

TL;DR: 本文研究了蒸馏数据量对模型性能的影响，发现了代码推理的缩放趋势，并揭示了小模型在不同蒸馏阶段的学习特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作缺乏对模型性能随着蒸馏数据量变化的 scaling 趋势的研究。

Method: 我们研究了在两个小型非推理LLM上蒸馏竞争性编码技能的缩放趋势，并验证了存在一个“代码推理峡谷”的假设。

Result: 我们发现，在低和中低数据范围内，小模型从更容易的编码问题中受益更大，而训练数据输出的正确性对蒸馏结果没有影响。

Conclusion: 我们的工作代表了在理解代码推理蒸馏的训练动态方面迈出的一步，超越了直觉。

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models
benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We
also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes
no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in
understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside
intuition

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型中的幻觉现象，提出了一种新的框架来追踪和解释这些错误，并揭示了其内在机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易产生幻觉，即生成看似合理但事实错误的陈述。本文旨在研究这种失败模式的内在架构根源。

Method: 本文提出了Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)框架，用于追踪模型内部语义失败，并识别导致幻觉的特定层和机制。

Result: 本文发现了一个特定的'承诺层'，在该层模型的内部表示不可逆地偏离了真实性。同时，发现了两种计算路径之间的冲突，导致可预测的失败模式。

Conclusion: 本文提供了对大型语言模型中幻觉现象的机制性解释，并提出了一个能够预测幻觉发生的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

TL;DR: 本文提出并行分词器，通过语义等价词的索引一致性提升多语言模型的跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分词方法无法有效支持跨语言迁移，因为语义等价的词被分配了不同的嵌入。

Method: 引入并行分词器，通过双语词典或逐字翻译对齐词汇表，确保语义等价词具有相同的索引。

Result: 在所有任务中，使用并行分词器训练的模型都优于传统的多语言基线模型。

Conclusion: 重新思考分词是推动多语言表示学习发展的关键，特别是在低资源环境中。

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 CreditDecoding 的训练-free 并行解码算法，通过利用历史信息来减少冗余迭代并提高解码效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法经常重复遮罩标记，因为初始置信度分数较低，导致冗余迭代并限制整体加速。我们希望通过利用历史信息来避免冗余步骤。

Method: 通过分析 dLLM 解码轨迹，我们观察到模型通常在解码步骤前几步骤就决定了某个标记的最终预测。我们引入了 Trace Credit 概念，通过累积历史 logit 来量化每个标记的收敛潜力。然后，我们提出了 CreditDecoding，这是一种训练-free 的并行解码算法，通过融合当前 logit 和 Trace Credit 加速正确但信心不足的标记的信心收敛。

Result: CreditDecoding 在八个基准测试中实现了 5.48 倍的速度提升和 0.48 的性能提升，超过了 LLaDA-8B-Instruct；并且实现了 4.11 倍的速度提升和 0.15 的性能提升，超过了 LLaDA-MoE-Instruct。

Conclusion: CreditDecoding 是一种训练-free 的并行解码算法，能够显著减少冗余迭代并提高解码鲁棒性。它在多个基准测试中表现出色，并且可以有效地扩展到长序列，是一种易于集成和多功能的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

*Jan Cegin,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Jakub Simko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoSE is a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without human test sets, achieving a positive correlation with performance on human test data and outperforming other intrinsic heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations, which are often unavailable for low-resource languages, while intrinsic metrics correlate poorly with downstream performance.

Method: RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this small model.

Result: RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other intrinsic heuristics across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks. It outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within 0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline.

Conclusion: RoSE is a promising proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without human test sets, as it achieves a positive correlation with performance on human test data and outperforms other intrinsic heuristics.

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and
evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only
metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

*Dingyu Yao,Chenxu Yang,Zhengyang Tong,Zheng Lin,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VecInfer is a novel VQ method for aggressive KV cache compression that suppresses key cache outliers and enables efficient inference, achieving performance comparable to full precision with significant speedup and latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large language model (LLM) inference. Existing vector quantization (VQ) methods suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook utilization.

Method: VecInfer is a novel vector quantization (VQ) method that applies smooth and Hadamard transformations to suppress outliers in the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data distribution. An optimized CUDA kernel is designed to fuse computation with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead.

Result: VecInfer achieves performance comparable to full precision with only 2-bit quantization. It delivers up to 2.7× speedup in large-batch self-attention computation and 8.3× reduction in single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

Conclusion: VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable to full precision, while delivering significant speedup and latency reduction.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

TL;DR: 本研究揭示了语言模型在上下文中绑定和检索实体的机制，包括位置、词汇和反射机制，并开发了一个高效的因果模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究表明，语言模型通过位置机制进行实体检索，但在复杂设置中表现不佳。我们需要找到更可靠的方法来理解语言模型如何绑定和检索实体。

Method: 通过九个模型和十个绑定任务的广泛实验，我们发现语言模型混合使用位置机制、词汇机制和反射机制来驱动模型行为，并开发了一个结合所有三种机制的因果模型。

Result: 我们的模型在估计下一个标记分布时与实际结果有95%的一致性，并且在更长的输入和自然设置中表现出色。

Conclusion: 我们的研究建立了更完整的图景，说明语言模型如何在上下文中绑定和检索实体。

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

Motivation: 现有研究主要采用单次设置，忽略了科学研究开发中迭代和反馈驱动的现实工作流程，因此需要一个更贴近实际的评估基准和方法。

Method: 提出RECODE-H基准和ReCodeAgent框架，通过多轮交互和反馈机制评估和改进LLM生成代码的能力。

Result: 实验表明，使用丰富反馈的LLM在性能上有了显著提升，但仍存在生成复杂研究代码的挑战。

Conclusion: RECODE-H为开发适应性、反馈驱动的LLM代理奠定了基础，有助于提升科学研究实现中的代码生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing
adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

TL;DR: BanglaTalk is the first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects, which uses a dialect-aware ASR system and operates at a low bandwidth with minimal end-to-end delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use and focus only on standard Bengali.

Method: BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect, developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional dialects.

Result: BanglaTalk is the first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the RegSpeech12 dataset.

Conclusion: BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of 24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

TL;DR: LST is a speech-text model that aggregates speech tokens into latent patches for better alignment and efficiency, showing improved performance on speech and text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-regressive speech-text models suffer from shortcomings due to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens compared to textual tokens, leading to compute imbalance and hindered alignment between modalities, resulting in slower scaling laws.

Method: The Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST) dynamically and inexpensively aggregates speech tokens into latent speech patches, which serve as higher-level units to aid capability transfer or encapsulate common speech sequences like silences for better compute efficiency.

Result: LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training on HellaSwag story completion, while also improving text performance.

Conclusion: LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, indicating more effective representational alignment and steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. LST also improves speech and text performance on HellaSwag story completion.

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CogRE, a framework for relation extraction that enhances both accuracy and explainability through a reasoning mechanism inspired by cognitive science and an optimization process driven by reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RE lacks supervision for language-based explanations. CogRE aims to address this by promoting outputs that include important relation keywords.

Method: CogRE is a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances both accuracy and explainability. It has two key components: (i) a reasoning mechanism that formulates RE as a series of text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. The framework uses a high-quality dictionary automatically constructed using an LLM.

Result: CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited one-shot learning capability. For example, cognitive-structured reasoning with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute).

Conclusion: CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited one-shot learning capability. Human evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54% (relative).

TL;DR: 本文研究了模型架构对跨模态适应方法的影响，发现解码器-only模型在未经修改的情况下表现较差，但通过引入两种新方法，可以显著提高其性能，使其接近编码器-only模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解码器-only模型在自然语言处理领域更受欢迎且在生成自然语言方面表现出色，但大多数提出的跨模态适应方法集中在编码器-only模型上，这引发了关于模型架构如何影响这些方法的问题。因此，本文旨在研究模型架构对跨模态适应方法的影响。

Method: 本文进行了一系列消融研究，系统地比较了编码器-only和解码器-only模型在基于偏微分方程（PDEs）的时间依赖性模拟任务中的跨模态适应表现。此外，还提出了两种新的方法：Parallel Flipping和Sequence Doubling，以尝试在自回归模型中模仿双向性。

Result: 研究发现，当现有方法未经修改地应用于解码器-only模型时，其表现远不如编码器-only模型。相比之下，在其他领域中，扩大解码器-only模型的规模也没有帮助。然而，通过提出的两种新方法，解码器-only模型在所有任务和所有跨模型适应方法中都提高了整体性能，缩小了与编码器-only模型的差距。

Conclusion: 本文的结论是，通过引入两种新的方法，可以提高解码器-only模型在跨模态适应任务中的性能，使其接近编码器-only模型的表现，并希望这些发现能拓宽跨模态适应任务中使用的模型范围，以促进科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ARLAS框架，利用对抗强化学习提高LLM代理的安全性，通过同时训练攻击者和防御者，使代理能够抵御多种攻击并提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的防御策略依赖于手动构造的已知攻击数据集，这限制了其多样性，使代理容易受到新型提示注入的攻击。因此，需要一种新的方法来提高代理的安全性。

Method: 提出了一种基于对抗强化学习的框架ARLAS，通过将问题建模为两人零和博弈，同时训练攻击者生成多样化的提示注入，并训练代理进行防御。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上评估表明，经过ARLAS微调的代理在攻击成功率方面显著低于原始模型，同时任务成功率也有所提高。

Conclusion: 通过对抗强化学习框架ARLAS，可以有效提升LLM代理的安全性，使其在面对各种攻击时更加鲁棒。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

*Yurun Song,Zhuoyi Yang,Ian G. Harris,Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes AMAQ, a method that improves communication efficiency in collaborative training of large language models by compressing activations and gradients using adaptive bit allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) creates challenges for collaborative server-client distributed training, particularly in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. The goal is to address these challenges by implementing parameter-efficient split learning.

Method: The paper introduces Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), which progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision to low precision using bit regularization to allocate bit budgets across channels based on feature-wise and layer-wise importance.

Result: AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches, delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. It also enhances training stability and reduces ultra-low bit representation collapse during training.

Conclusion: AMAQ provides a practical and effective solution for collaborative training with minimal communication cost by achieving a good trade-off between communication overhead and model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

TL;DR: 我们提出了NorMuon，一种结合正交化和神经元级自适应学习率的优化器，它在多个模型规模上表现出色，优于Adam和Muon。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Muon作为Adam的潜在继任者出现，但尚未系统地探索联合利用它们的优势。我们的工作旨在填补这一空白，通过提出NorMuon来解决这个问题。

Method: 我们提出了NorMuon（Neuron-wise Normalized Muon），这是一种结合了正交化和神经元级自适应学习率的优化器。我们分析了Muon的有效性，并通过保持每个神经元的二阶动量统计和在正交化后应用行归一化来解决更新中的不平衡问题。此外，我们开发了一个高效的分布式实现，在FSDP2框架下战略性地将正交化计算分布在设备上。

Result: 实验结果显示，NorMuon在多个模型规模上 consistently 超过Adam和Muon，在1.1 B预训练设置中，比Adam提高了21.74%的训练效率，比Muon提高了11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大规模深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新的途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的调度方法，用于改进掩码扩散模型的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MDMs支持任何顺序的采样，但性能对下一个要取消屏蔽的位置的选择非常敏感。先前的工作通常依赖于基于规则的调度（例如，最大置信度、最大边缘），这些调度提供临时改进。

Method: 我们将去噪过程建模为带有显式参考策略的KL正则化马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并优化一个允许策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标。

Result: 在SUDOKU基准测试中，我们的学习策略比随机策略提高了20.1%，比最大置信度策略提高了11.2%。

Conclusion: 我们的实验表明，学习到的策略在四个基准测试中始终优于最大置信度策略。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ePF, an improved Particle Filtering method that addresses particle impoverishment by balancing exploration and exploitation, resulting in better performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address particle impoverishment in Particle Filtering (PF) when guided by process reward models, which leads to suboptimal solutions due to premature exploitation.

Method: Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), which integrates two new techniques: Entropic Annealing (EA) and Look-ahead Modulation (LaM).

Result: ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves up to a 50% relative improvement in task reward on several challenging math benchmarks.

Conclusion: ePF improves PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately leading to higher-quality solutions.

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

Motivation: 现有的混合方法无意中绕过了线性组件，几乎完全依赖于SWA。组件级别的诊断揭示了这种之前未被发现的行为源于对常识基准的评估实践的忽视。

Method: 我们提出了三种解决方案：(i) 推理时将仅线性转换与滑动窗口softmax进行混合；(ii) HedgeCATs，结合注意力权重传输与有针对性的LoRA微调；以及(iii) 时序滑动窗口丢弃（SSD），在训练期间随机抑制softmax分支以防止组件崩溃。

Result: 我们的方法在保持计算效率的同时恢复了基础模型的大部分性能，并确保了真正的线性注意力采用，恢复了混合转换中性能归因的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在保持计算效率的同时恢复了基础模型的大部分性能，并确保了真正的线性注意力采用，恢复了混合转换中性能归因的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要扩展推理的复杂任务中越来越常用，但需要在注入足够的随机性以探索多个推理链和确保每条路径的准确性之间取得平衡。

Method: 我们提出了简单的策略，如Greedy-Threshold、Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon，以根据估计的正确性调整解码规则。

Result: 我们的方法在数学和一般推理基准上取得了改进，表明解码规则应根据正确性校准，而不是仅依赖置信度。

Conclusion: 我们的研究挑战了关于在不确定性下解码的现有启发式方法，并在数学和一般推理基准上展示了改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种原则性的审计框架，用于验证大型语言模型（LLMs）的优化目标，从而提高AI的可信度和问责性。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse
tasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect
outputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications.
Conformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift,
often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a
new framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our
framework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain
shift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their
proximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing
adaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark
demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than
standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution
shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward
trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world
deployment.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has
catalyzed a transformative technological revolution across all walks of life.
As the backbone of wideband communication, optical networks are expecting
high-level autonomous operation and zero-touch management to accommodate their
expanding network scales and escalating transmission bandwidth. The integration
of GenAI is deemed as the pivotal solution for realizing zero-touch optical
networks. However, the lifecycle management of optical networks involves a
multitude of tasks and necessitates seamless collaboration across multiple
layers, which poses significant challenges to the existing single-agent GenAI
systems. In this paper, we propose a GenAI-driven hierarchical multi-agent
framework designed to streamline multi-task autonomous execution for zero-touch
optical networks. We present the architecture, implementation, and applications
of this framework. A field-deployed mesh network is utilized to demonstrate
three typical scenarios throughout the lifecycle of optical network: quality of
transmission estimation in the planning stage, dynamic channel adding/dropping
in the operation stage, and system capacity increase in the upgrade stage. The
case studies, illustrate the capabilities of multi-agent framework in
multi-task allocation, coordination, execution, evaluation, and summarization.
This work provides a promising approach for the future development of
intelligent, efficient, and collaborative network management solutions, paving
the way for more specialized and adaptive zero-touch optical networks.

TL;DR: NANOMIND是一种硬件-软件协同设计的推理框架，能够将大型多模态模型分解为模块化组件，并将其映射到最适合的加速器上，从而提高资源效率和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型通常以单体方式执行，导致无法充分利用现代SoC中的异构加速器，从而造成高端到端延迟。因此，需要一种更高效的执行方式来优化资源利用。

Result: NANOMIND框架在电池供电设备上实现了完整的大型多模态模型运行，无需网络连接，具有更高的吞吐量和优越的能效。该设计还绕过了CPU瓶颈，减少了冗余内存使用，并在资源效率方面优于现有实现，能耗降低了42.3%，GPU内存使用减少了11.2%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种硬件-软件协同设计的推理框架NANOMIND，能够将大型多模态模型分解为模块化的“积木”，并将其映射到最适合的加速器上。该框架在资源效率方面优于现有实现，显著降低了能耗和GPU内存使用，并使电池供电设备能够长时间运行大型多模态模型。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision
and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost
always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous
accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end
latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design
inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models
into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its
ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into
modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.
It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on
unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level
scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our
framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs
entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent
assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher
throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The
design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage
through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system
outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy
consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a
battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a
day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.

*Renee Shelby,Fernando Diaz,Vinodkumar Prabhakaran*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于实证的框架TUNA，用于描述用户在与对话AI交互时的行为，该框架能够支持多尺度评估并促进产品间的政策协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话行为的分类要么过于泛化，要么局限于特定领域，或者将互动简化为狭窄的对话功能。因此需要一种能够捕捉用户工具性目标以及实现这些目标的环境适应和社会实践的框架。

Method: 通过1193次人机对话的迭代定性分析，并结合理论回顾和跨不同情境的验证，开发了TUNA框架。

Result: TUNA框架将用户行为组织成一个包含信息寻求、综合、程序指导、内容创作、社交互动和元对话的行为三层层次结构。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个系统化的词汇来描述AI的使用，推动了对更安全、更响应和更负责的对话系统的学术理解和实际设计。

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of conversational AI highlights the need for frameworks
that capture not only users' instrumental goals but also the situated,
adaptive, and social practices through which they achieve them. Existing
taxonomies of conversational behavior either overgeneralize, remain
domain-specific, or reduce interactions to narrow dialogue functions. To
address this gap, we introduce the Taxonomy of User Needs and Actions (TUNA),
an empirically grounded framework developed through iterative qualitative
analysis of 1193 human-AI conversations, supplemented by theoretical review and
validation across diverse contexts. TUNA organizes user actions into a
three-level hierarchy encompassing behaviors associated with information
seeking, synthesis, procedural guidance, content creation, social interaction,
and meta-conversation. By centering user agency and appropriation practices,
TUNA enables multi-scale evaluation, supports policy harmonization across
products, and provides a backbone for layering domain-specific taxonomies. This
work contributes a systematic vocabulary for describing AI use, advancing both
scholarly understanding and practical design of safer, more responsive, and
more accountable conversational systems.

*Xi Xuan,Xuechen Liu,Wenxin Zhang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Xiaojian Lin,Tomi Kinnunen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的参数高效的前端，结合提示调整和经典信号处理变换，并引入了WaveSP-Net架构，在两个新且具有挑战性的基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR, which is not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic, in-the-wild data types.

Method: Introduce a new family of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal processing transforms, including FourierPT-XLSR, WSPT-XLSR, and Partial-WSPT-XLSR. Propose WaveSP-Net, which combines a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end with a bidirectional Mamba-based back-end.

Result: WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable parameters and notable performance gains.

Conclusion: WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable parameters and notable performance gains.

Abstract: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full
fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is
not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic,
in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family
of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal
processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier
Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and
Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture
combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based
back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt
embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts
without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate
that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and
challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable
parameters and notable performance gains. The code and models are available at

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了TokenChain，一种结合语义标记ASR和两阶段TTS的完全离散语音链，通过端到端反馈和动态权重平均实现有效的链式学习，结果表明其在多个数据集上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器语音链模拟人类感知-生产循环，在联合改进ASR和TTS方面表现出有效性。

Method: 提出了一种名为TokenChain的完全离散语音链，将语义标记ASR与两阶段TTS相结合：一个与ASR共同训练的自回归文本到语义模型，以及一个用于合成的掩码生成语义到声学模型。通过动态权重平均，利用监督ASR实现了端到端反馈。

Result: 评估显示，TokenChain在LibriSpeech上比基线准确率高出2-6个epoch，并在等epoch误差上降低了5-13%，同时在TED-LIUM上将ASR的WER相对减少了56%，T2S的WER减少了31%，且遗忘最小。

Conclusion: TokenChain在LibriSpeech上比基线准确率高出2-6个epoch，并在等epoch误差上降低了5-13%，同时在TED-LIUM上将ASR的WER相对减少了56%，T2S的WER减少了31%，证明了链式学习在使用token接口和模型时仍然有效。

Abstract: Machine Speech Chain, simulating the human perception-production loop, proves
effective in jointly improving ASR and TTS. We propose TokenChain, a fully
discrete speech chain coupling semantic-token ASR with a two-stage TTS: an
autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR and a
masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. End-to-end
feedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through
argmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight
averaging. Ablations examine optimal temperature schedules for in- and
cross-domain transfer. Evaluation reveals TokenChain surpasses baseline
accuracy 2-6 epochs earlier and yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with
stable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by
31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting, showing that chain learning remains
effective with token interfaces and models.

### [111] [Towards Reliable and Practical LLM Security Evaluations via Bayesian Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05709)
*Mary Llewellyn,Annie Gray,Josh Collyer,Michael Harries*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于评估LLM对提示注入攻击脆弱性的端到端框架，包括实验设计方法和贝叶斯分层模型，以提高不确定性量化。结果显示，考虑输出变异性可以得出不太明确的结论，但某些攻击下Transformer和Mamba变体的漏洞显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在采用新的大型语言模型（LLM）架构之前，准确理解漏洞至关重要。现有的评估难以信任，常常从不具有意义可比性的LLM中得出结论，依赖启发式输入或使用无法捕捉固有不确定性的指标。

Method: 我们提出了一个原则性和实用性的端到端框架，用于评估LLM对提示注入攻击的脆弱性。首先，我们提出了实际的实验设计方法，解决不公平的LLM比较问题，考虑了两种实践场景：训练LLM和部署预训练LLM。其次，我们解决了实验分析，并提出了一个带有嵌入空间聚类的贝叶斯分层模型。该模型旨在改进不确定性量化，在LLM输出不是确定性的常见情况下，测试提示设计不完美，且从业者只有有限的计算资源来评估脆弱性。

Result: 我们展示了模型在几个提示注入攻击设置中的改进推断能力。最后，我们演示了评估Transformer与Mamba架构安全性的流程。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，考虑输出变异性可以得出不太明确的结论。然而，对于某些攻击，我们发现Transformer和Mamba变体在具有相同训练数据或数学能力的LLM中显示出显著增加的漏洞。

Abstract: Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical
to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult
to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully
comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to
capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and
practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt
injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental
design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner
scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second,
we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical
model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve
uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not
deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only
have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the
improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection
attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security
of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration
of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some
attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant
vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical
ability.

### [112] [Quantum Concept Music Score from Quantum Picturalism: Musical Incarnation of a Bell-Pair under Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05391)
*Rakhat-Bi Abdyssagin,Bob Coecke*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文介绍了量子概念音乐（QCM），这是一种基于范畴量子力学的新音乐形式主义，能够捕捉音乐的交互性质，并超越传统记谱法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的西方古典音乐记谱法主要依赖于线性表示，这并不总是能充分捕捉音乐的本质。因此，需要一种新的方法来强调音乐的基本关系维度，并将量子现象转化为音乐作品。

Method: 基于范畴量子力学（CQM）和其图示实现量子图像学（QPict），特别是基于ZX演算，提出了一种新的语言和理论来描述音乐创作、表演和自动化中的关系。

Result: QCM 能够直观地、严格地和机械地将量子现象转化为音乐作品，并提供了一种新的自动化音乐模板，例如在AI生成的背景下。

Conclusion: QCM 是一种强大的音乐形式主义，能够捕捉音乐的交互性质，并超越西方古典音乐记谱法的界限，适用于多种音乐风格和方向。

Abstract: We initiate the development of a new language and theory for quantum music,
to which we refer as Quantum Concept Music (QCM). This new music formalism is
based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its
diagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on
ZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is
the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and
between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM
also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music
compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.
  Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a
Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live
performed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily
relied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately
capture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the
fundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based
technique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition,
but also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new
template for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.
  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is
powerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in
terms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of
Western classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different
genres and directions.

*Yansen Zhang,Qingcan Kang,Yujie Chen,Yufei Wang,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Mingxuan Yuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语义锚定的校正框架SAC-Opt，以提高基于大语言模型的优化建模的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常保持求解器驱动：它们依赖于单次正向生成，并根据求解器错误信息应用有限的后期修复，这会导致未被检测到的语义错误，这些错误会静默地产生语法正确但逻辑有缺陷的模型。

Method: 我们提出了SAC-Opt，这是一种向后引导的校正框架，将优化建模建立在问题语义上，而不是求解器反馈上。SAC-Opt在每一步都将原始语义锚点与从生成代码中重建的语义锚点对齐，并选择性地校正不匹配的组件，从而推动收敛到语义忠实的模型。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提高了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上的提升高达21.9%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在基于LLM的优化工作流中，以语义锚定的校正的重要性，以确保从问题意图到可执行求解器代码的忠实翻译。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

*Radha Gulhane,Sathish Reddy Indurthi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合奖励建模框架，结合了基于模型的奖励和基于规则的奖励，通过强化学习策略优化实现多模态大语言模型的有效对齐。实验结果表明，该方法在多个多模态基准测试中均取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与人类偏好对齐通常依赖于单一信号、基于模型的奖励方法。这些单一奖励在跨领域任务中缺乏置信度校准，无法捕捉人类偏好的多样化方面，并且需要大量的数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 本文提出了一种混合奖励建模框架，结合了基于模型的奖励和基于规则的奖励。基于模型的奖励通过学习的奖励模型从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量得分，而基于规则的奖励则通过领域特定的启发式方法提供显式的正确性信号。此外，还引入了多方面奖励以确保指令遵循，并提出了广义的长度惩罚奖励以稳定训练并提高性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，在应用混合和多方面奖励建模时，不同多模态基准测试中均取得了持续的改进。3B系列中表现最好的模型在一般和数学推理任务中平均提升了约9.5%。特别是在数学基准测试中，模型平均提升了约16%，突显了其在数学推理和问题解决方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种混合奖励建模框架，通过强化学习策略优化实现了多模态大语言模型的有效对齐。实验结果表明，在不同多模态基准测试中，混合和多方面奖励建模方法都取得了持续的改进。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

TL;DR: This paper explores the Dunning-Kruger Effect in AI models, revealing that less competent models and those in rare programming languages show stronger overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the Dunning-Kruger Effect in AI models, particularly in coding tasks.

Method: Analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming languages.

Result: AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence, especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains.

Conclusion: AI models exhibit DKE-like bias, with less competent models and those in rare programming languages showing stronger bias.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要跟踪拒绝或预定义的安全违规，但这些仅检查规则合规性，无法揭示模型在面对有争议的现实问题时是否维持连贯的价值体系。

Method: 引入了 VAL-Bench 基准，通过使用 LLM 作为评判者来评估模型在面对不同框架的配对提示时是否保持稳定的价值立场。

Result: 应用在领先的开源和闭源模型上，该基准揭示了对齐的巨大差异，并突显了安全策略（如拒绝）与更丰富的价值体系之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench 提供了一个可扩展且可重复的基准，使系统比较 LLM 如何可靠地体现人类价值观成为可能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一种新的可训练代理框架，通过优化规划器并在多轮循环中直接优化，提高了模型在多个任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具增强方法在处理长时程和多样化工具时表现不佳，而代理系统虽然提供了一种有前途的替代方案，但大多数仍然是训练-free 或依赖于与多轮交互的实时动态脱节的离线训练。

Method: AgentFlow是一个可训练的、实时流的代理框架，通过一个不断进化的记忆协调四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器），并在多轮循环中直接优化其规划器。此外，提出了基于流的组精炼策略优化（Flow-GRPO）来处理长时程、稀疏奖励的信用分配问题。

Result: AgentFlow在搜索、代理、数学和科学任务方面平均准确率分别提高了14.9%、14.0%、14.5%和4.1%，甚至超过了更大的专有模型如GPT-4o。

Conclusion: AgentFlow在多个基准测试中表现出色，优于现有的顶级基线，并且在模型规模和推理回合数上显示出积极的扩展性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

*Bohan Yao,Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自动MAS设计范式，专注于优化CoT推理。引入了Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM)，通过树搜索发现，从简单的CoT模块开始，并通过执行轨迹的反思进行突变。ARM作为通用的推理构建块，可以作为递归循环或学习元协调器的子例程使用。该方法显著优于手动设计和最先进的自动方法，并在不同模型和任务领域中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的工作提出了自动化设计MAS的技术，但这些技术表现不佳，通常与简单的基线相当或更差。此外，它们需要为每个新的任务领域进行计算昂贵的架构重新发现，并且在没有现有标记验证集的领域需要昂贵的数据标注。简单的Chain of Thought (CoT)推理经常与这些复杂系统竞争，这表明MAS的基本推理单元CoT值得进一步研究。

Method: 我们提出了一个新范式，将自动MAS设计的重点转向优化CoT推理。我们引入了Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM)，这是一个代理的CoT泛化版本，其中每个细粒度的推理步骤由专门的推理模块执行。该模块通过在代码空间上的树搜索发现，从简单的CoT模块开始，并通过执行轨迹的反思进行突变。

Result: 我们的方法显著优于手动设计的MAS和最先进的自动MAS设计方法。使用ARM构建的MAS表现出卓越的泛化能力，在不同基础模型和任务领域中保持高性能，无需进一步优化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒性仍然具有挑战性，尤其是在文化复杂且快速演变的memes中。本研究旨在探索使用大规模、跨语言数据集进行早期预测的可行性。

Method: 本研究提出了一种基于混合参与分数的数据驱动方法来定义病毒性，并使用基于百分位数的阈值从时间上保留的训练集中防止数据泄漏。评估了多种模型，包括逻辑回归、XGBoost和多层感知器（MLP），并使用了跨时间窗口（30-420分钟）的多模态特征集。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了早期预测memes病毒性的稳健、可解释和实用的基准，特别是在无法获得完整扩散级联数据的情况下。此外，还贡献了一个新颖的跨语言数据集和一个方法学上合理的病毒性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态反事实基准，用于评估模型的真实推理能力，并发现模型在演绎任务中表现更好，但在归纳任务中泛化能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进行无污染的数学能力评估具有挑战性，因为模型可能会记住测试集，而当前的数学基准由于符号和规则的多样性有限以及封闭的答案而容易过拟合。

Method: 论文提出了一种方法，利用这些缺点作为有用特征来构建动态的反事实基准，可用于揭示过拟合并衡量真正的推理能力。

Result: 通过MatheMagic，生成数学测试实例，其中数字和运算符的解释被改变，但答案可以自动验证。测试实例在测试时随机生成，以评估模型的归纳或演绎能力，提供了稳定性、可扩展性、可比性和对过拟合的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究发现，模型在演绎任务中表现更好，但在归纳任务中泛化能力较差。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

*Hudson de Martim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出SAT-Graph API，解决法律领域检索增强生成的问题，实现可解释的人工智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的检索增强生成在法律领域存在核心限制，需要一种可验证的知识图谱来建模法律规范的层次结构、时间演变和因果事件。然而，如何可靠地查询这种结构化知识而不牺牲其确定性属性仍然是一个关键差距。

Method: 本文引入了SAT-Graph API，这是一个基于规范操作的查询执行层，能够隔离概率发现与确定性检索，同时支持高精度混合搜索、稳健的引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计的因果追踪。

Result: SAT-Graph API通过将复杂查询分解为这些操作的有向无环图（DAG），实现了透明且可审计的检索过程，直接满足了高风险领域对可解释人工智能的要求。

Conclusion: 本文提出了SAT-Graph API，通过形式化的查询执行层解决了法律领域中检索增强生成的核心问题，并实现了可解释的人工智能要求。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MixReasoning框架，以动态调整推理深度，从而在保持准确性的同时提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型在每个步骤上应用扩展推理会引入大量冗余，因为子问题的难度和复杂性差异很大。

Method: 提出了一种框架，称为MixReasoning，该框架在单个响应中动态调整推理深度。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME上的实验表明，MixReasoning能够缩短推理长度并显著提高效率而不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning能够缩短推理长度并显著提高效率而不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

*Jiaru Zou,Soumya Roy,Vinay Kumar Verma,Ziyi Wang,David Wipf,Pan Lu,Sumit Negi,James Zou,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TaTToo is a new PRM framework for tabular reasoning that improves LRM performance by 30.9% and outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs struggle with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema interaction, leading to performance bottlenecks in tabular reasoning domains.

Method: We propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and integrates tool-based verification. We design a scalable data curation pipeline and train TaTToo with a dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with tool-grounded reward shaping.

Result: TaTToo improves downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines like Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and shows strong generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Conclusion: TaTToo improves downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines, and demonstrates strong generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

TL;DR: ShortCoTI is a framework that generates more concise chain-of-thought sequences for efficient image generation, reducing computational costs while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of visual overthinking, where longer CoT sequences can introduce unnecessary redundancy, increase computational costs, and contradict the original prompt. The goal is to generate more concise CoT sequences for efficient image generation.

Method: ShortCoTI is a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences while preserving output image quality. It uses an adaptive reward function that scales according to the estimated difficulty of each task and incorporates this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm.

Result: ShortCoTI reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks. Qualitative analysis shows that it eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing concise and semantically rich reasoning prompts.

Conclusion: ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images.

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的空间音频大语言模型Sci-Phi，能够全面描述声音场景，具有广泛的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频语言模型在声音识别方面表现出色，但单通道输入从根本上限制了空间理解。因此，需要一种能够全面描述声音场景的模型。

Method: 本文提出了Sci-Phi，一个具有双空间和频谱编码器的空间音频大语言模型，能够估计所有声音源和周围环境的完整参数集。

Result: Sci-Phi能够在一次通过中枚举和描述最多四个方向声音源，同时包括非方向背景声音和房间特征。它在各种条件下表现出良好的鲁棒性，并且能够推广到真实的房间脉冲响应。

Conclusion: 本文建立了第一个能够进行完整空间场景描述的音频大语言模型，具有在现实世界中部署的潜力。

Abstract: Acoustic scene perception involves describing the type of sounds, their
timing, their direction and distance, as well as their loudness and
reverberation. While audio language models excel in sound recognition,
single-channel input fundamentally limits spatial understanding. This work
presents Sci-Phi, a spatial audio large language model with dual spatial and
spectral encoders that estimates a complete parameter set for all sound sources
and the surrounding environment. Learning from over 4,000 hours of synthetic
first-order Ambisonics recordings including metadata, Sci-Phi enumerates and
describes up to four directional sound sources in one pass, alongside
non-directional background sounds and room characteristics. We evaluate the
model with a permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content,
location, timing, loudness, and reverberation, and analyze its robustness
across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and
challenging mixtures of acoustically, spatially, or temporally similar sources.
Notably, Sci-Phi generalizes to real room impulse responses with only minor
performance degradation. Overall, this work establishes the first audio LLM
capable of full spatial-scene description, with strong potential for real-world
deployment. Demo: https://sci-phi-audio.github.io/demo
