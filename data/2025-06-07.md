### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GEM的自监督方法，使大型解码器语言模型能够生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保持其原始文本生成和推理能力。在两个流行的LLM系列上评估了转换后的模型，并展示了该方法在MTEB上的显著改进和对MMLU的最小影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用程序仍然依赖于单独的嵌入模型来生成文本嵌入，这可能会使系统复杂化，并在查询理解方面引入不一致。

Method: 插入新的特殊标记到文本体中，并通过操作注意力掩码生成文本的总结嵌入。此方法可以轻松集成到任何现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在MTEB上的结果显示，所提出的方法显著提高了原始LLMs的表现，而在MMLU上的影响很小。

Conclusion: 我们的方法可以赋予LLMs最先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持其原始的NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that serves all accents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for an ASR system robust to a wide range of accents including unseen ones.

Method: Systematically study the effect of three training data variables on ASR robustness towards unseen accents.

Result: Increasing the number of speakers is more beneficial than increasing the audio duration per speaker. More speakers enable performance gains from scaling hours. Prioritizing diverse accents offers minimal benefits when the number of speakers is fixed.

Conclusion: Practitioners should prioritize increasing speaker count in ASR training data for new languages.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to break down sentence embeddings into interpretable parts using dictionary learning on token-level representations. It also explores how pooling affects these features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal structure of sentence embeddings better and make them more transparent and controllable.

Method: Using dictionary learning on token-level representations to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components.

Result: Found that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making sentence embeddings more transparent and controllable.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HTC-CLIP, a new method for Hierarchical Text Classification that combines label hierarchy encoding and text encoding using contrastive learning, improving performance by up to 2.37% on Macro F1 score compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hierarchical text classification performance by combining complementary approaches for encoding label hierarchy and text.

Method: Proposes HTC-CLIP, which learns hierarchy-aware text representation and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive learning, and pools class probability distributions for better results.

Result: Tests on two public datasets showed an improvement of 0.99-2.37% in Macro F1 score over existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The combination of label hierarchy encoding and text encoding approaches in HTC-CLIP leads to better hierarchical text classification performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese, finding smaller fine-tuned models often perform better, with pre-training and instruction-tuning being crucial factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the performance of large language models on a low-resource language, Maltese.

Method: Evaluating 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks.

Result: Many models perform poorly, especially on generative tasks. Smaller fine-tuned models perform better across all tasks. Prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning is the most important factor affecting performance. Fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost but yields better performance and lower inference costs.

Conclusion: More inclusive language technologies are needed. Researchers working with low-resource languages should consider traditional language modelling approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new model architecture that improves intent classification accuracy in customer care tasks across different domains with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for better intent classification in customer care tasks across different domains with limited labeled data.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple domains.

Result: An increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection.

Conclusion: The proposed model architecture shows promise in improving intent classification accuracy in customer care tasks across different domains with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human-scale transformer language models can generalize rare constructions' forms but not meanings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the generalization ability of human-scale transformer language models for both the form and meaning of rare constructions.

Method: Constructing a synthetic benchmark targeting syntactic and semantic properties of the LET-ALONE construction.

Result: Human-scale LMs are sensitive to form but fail to correctly generalize about its meaning.

Conclusion: There is an asymmetry in current architectures' sample efficiency between language form and meaning.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

### [10] [Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04458)
*Xueqiang Xu,Jinfeng Xiao,James Barry,Mohab Elkaref,Jiaru Zou,Pengcheng Jiang,Yunyi Zhang,Max Giammona,Geeth de Mel,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents ZOES, a new approach for entity structure extraction using a principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification without requiring schemas or annotated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on predefined schemas or annotated datasets, leading to incomplete extraction results.

Method: ZOES uses a principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification based on the mutual reinforcement between entities and their associated structures.

Result: Experiments show that ZOES improves LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three domains.

Conclusion: The enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism can be a principled approach to enhance the quality of LLM-based entity structure discovery.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of two watermarking methods (Gumbel and KGW) on the alignment properties of four large language models, identifying two degradation patterns. It proposes Alignment Resampling (AR) to recover alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effects of watermarking on the truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness of large language models.

Method: Systematic analysis of watermarking approaches and proposing Alignment Resampling (AR).

Result: Two degradation patterns identified: guard attenuation and guard amplification. AR successfully recovers baseline alignment.

Conclusion: Balancing watermark strength and model alignment is crucial; AR provides a practical inference-time solution for deploying watermarked LLMs.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheng Li,Tianyi Liu,Haodong Wang,Hyokun Yun,Ming Zeng,Pei Chen,Zhihan Zhang,Yifan Gao,Ruijie Wang,Priyanka Nigam,Bing Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC是一种新的框架，它利用用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐式人类偏好来生成偏好数据，从而提高大语言模型与人类价值观的一致性并改善生成响应的质量。实验表明，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型比传统方法提高了9.37%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好学习方法依赖于人工或高级LLMs的策划数据，这既昂贵又难以扩展。PUGC旨在通过利用未标记的UGC中的隐式偏好来解决这个问题。

Method: PUGC将UGC转化为用户查询，并从策略模型生成响应。然后利用UGC作为参考文本对响应进行评分，以使模型与这些隐式偏好保持一致。

Result: 在Alpaca Eval 2上的实验结果显示，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型比传统方法提高了9.37%的性能，达到了35.93%的长度控制胜率。进一步研究表明了奖励质量、特定领域的对齐效果、对UGC质量的鲁棒性以及理论思维能力的提升。

Conclusion: PUGC提供了一种有效的、可扩展的方法来生成偏好数据，以改进大语言模型的生成质量。该方法在多个方面显示出显著的优势，包括奖励质量、领域特定的对齐、鲁棒性和理论思维能力。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens是一个用于检测和修正大语言模型生成SQL语句中的语义错误的端到端框架，它通过整合数据库和模型的错误信号来提高文本转SQL系统的执行准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在文本转SQL任务上表现良好，但常常会产生语法正确但语义不正确的查询，缺乏对可靠性洞察。

Method: SQLens集成数据库和LLM的错误信号来识别SQL子句中的潜在语义错误，并利用这些信号指导查询修正。

Result: SQLens在两个公共基准测试中显示出比最好的基于LLM的自评估方法在错误检测F1分数上高出25.78%，并提升了最高20%的执行准确性。

Conclusion: SQLens为提高大语言模型生成SQL语句的可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes SLIDE and DRE methods to combine small and large language models for more reliable evaluation, especially in dialogue evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, while SLMs are robust in such scenarios but vulnerable to misleading or adversarial inputs.

Method: Introducing SLIDE, which integrates SLMs and LLMs through adaptive weighting, and further proposing a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM integration.

Result: Experiments show that DRE outperforms existing methods and demonstrates stronger alignment with human judgment across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work shows that integrating small and large language models can create more reliable evaluation tools, especially for open-ended tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

### [15] [Please Translate Again: Two Simple Experiments on Whether Human-Like Reasoning Helps Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04521)
*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigate whether explicitly decomposing the translation process improves LLM translation performance. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of decomposing translation tasks using CoT reasoning.

Method: Compare 'translate again' prompts with human-like step-by-step prompts.

Result: No clear evidence that explicit decomposition improves translation performance; 'translate again' prompts perform better.

Conclusion: Reasoning may still play a role in translation but requires further investigation into CoT's effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

TL;DR: This study examines how well large language models can understand the different meanings of the word 'just', showing that while they can tell some differences, they have trouble with the subtler ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of LLMs in distinguishing fine-grained senses of discourse particles like 'just' which are challenging even for humans.

Method: Using data carefully prepared and labeled by professional linguists to test LLMs' recognition of various meanings of 'just'.

Result: LLMs can differentiate broad categories of 'just' but fail to grasp more subtle distinctions.

Conclusion: There is a limitation in LLMs' comprehension of discourse particles, suggesting further research is needed.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Motivation: To evaluate the performance of large language models on questions without reasonable answers.

Method: Introduce a new benchmark and modify existing datasets.

Result: Existing models perform poorly on these questions.

Conclusion: Benchmarking LLMs on questions with no answer is meaningful.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that

TL;DR: Evaluate MT quality for under-resourced African languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating MT quality often suffer from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.

Method: Introduce SSA-MTE, a large-scale MTE dataset, and develop improved evaluation metrics SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE. Also benchmark prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with the strongest LLM evaluated in the study.

Conclusion: Released all resources under open licenses to support future research.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how malicious agents can manipulate multi-agent systems using large language models through subtle prompt manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the potential vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems when faced with malicious agents exploiting the system for personal gain without disrupting core functionality.

Method: Analyzing four types of integrity attacks: Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, and Free-Rider, all involving different forms of prompt manipulation.

Result: Demonstrates that strategically crafted prompts can introduce biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, allowing malicious agents to mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.

Conclusion: Highlights the necessity for robust security protocols, content validation mechanisms, and monitoring systems capable of assessing comprehensive risk scenarios in MAS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

### [20] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigating the effectiveness of large language models in zero-shot financial sentiment analysis, this study evaluates various LLMs and prompting strategies using the Financial PhraseBank dataset. It finds that GPT-4o without CoT prompting performs best, challenging the notion that more reasoning leads to better financial sentiment classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether reasoning improves performance in zero-shot financial sentiment analysis using large language models.

Method: Evaluating three proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms simulating System 1 and System 2 thinking, compared to two smaller financial sentiment analysis models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone).

Result: GPT-4o without CoT prompting showed the highest accuracy and alignment with human-labeled sentiment; reasoning did not improve performance and might lead to suboptimal predictions due to overthinking.

Conclusion: For financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive 'System 1'-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment than 'System 2'-style reasoning, challenging the assumption that more reasoning leads to better LLM decisions.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to translate lexically diversified text, and MenTaL, a method to improve LLMs' performance in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols and improve their performance in this aspect

Method: MenTaL method which guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation

Result: Experiments using SCALe confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. MenTaL method improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have deficiencies in translating lexically diversified text into uniform logical symbols. We proposed a benchmark SCALe to expose this issue and a method MenTaL to improve LLMs' performance.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [22] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel gradient matching approach for selecting demonstrations in In-Context Learning (ICL), which outperforms random selection on larger LLMs across 9 diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of demonstration selection in many-shot ICL, which currently relies on random selection due to the unsuitability of conventional instance-level retrieval.

Method: Introduces a gradient matching approach that aligns fine-tuning gradients between the target task's training set and selected examples to mimic the learning effect.

Result: The method outperforms random selection on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets, improving performance by up to 4% on some models.

Conclusion: This work provides a more reliable and effective way to perform many-shot ICL, enhancing its potential for broader applications.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents SUCEA, a training-free method for improving fact-checking systems by rephrasing adversarial claims through three steps: claim segmentation, iterative evidence retrieval and claim editing, and evidence aggregation and label prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat misinformation, existing fact-checking systems struggle with adversarial claims. This paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: SUCEA, a modular framework with three steps: claim segmentation and decontextualization, iterative evidence retrieval and claim editing, and evidence aggregation and label prediction.

Result: Experiments show SUCEA significantly improves retrieval and entailment label accuracy compared to four strong baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free method enhances fact-checking systems' performance against adversarial claims.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims for claim verification abilities in scientific literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no readily usable multimodal benchmark that directly tests claim verification abilities.

Method: Automatically extract supported claims from scientific articles and manually perturb them to produce contradicted claims.

Result: Most vision-language models perform poorly, with the best achieving 0.77 F1. Models are biased towards judging claims as supported and fail to understand nuanced perturbations within the claims.

Conclusion: Models struggle with localizing correct evidence within figures, aggregating information across modalities, and understanding basic components of the figure.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of semi-supervised learning in speech processing tasks by using large language models to refine pseudo labels.

Method: The framework refines pseudo-labeled text using an LLM and optimizes knowledge transfer efficiency with a data filtering strategy.

Result: LESS achieved significant improvements in word error rate and BLEU scores on different language, task, and domain datasets.

Conclusion: LESS demonstrates the potential of using large language models to boost semi-supervised learning in speech processing applications and provides new insights into leveraging LLM knowledge.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Method: 提出了一种回顾性、基于步骤的形式验证框架Safe，在每个推理步骤中使用形式数学语言Lean 4表达数学声明，并提供形式证明来识别幻觉。

Result: 该框架在多个语言模型和各种数学数据集上进行了评估，展示了显著的性能提升，并提供了可解释且可验证的证据。此外，还提出了一个包含30,809个形式陈述的FormalStep基准用于步骤正确性定理证明。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次利用形式数学语言Lean 4来验证由大型语言模型生成的自然语言内容，这与创建形式数学语言的原因一致：为容易出现幻觉的人类编写证明提供稳健的基础。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Conclusion: MISMATCHED is a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, covering non-CS domains and containing 2,700 human annotated sentence pairs. It provides substantial room for future improvements.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the

for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits Test-Time Scaling (TTS) effectiveness.

Method: ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a diversity-focused data strategy.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong baselines.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language

reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities in shaping creativity.

Method: Analyzing data from millions of creators across different fields using dynamic language representations and geometric spaces of concepts.

Result: Subjective perspectives anticipate creative attention and successful combinations, while background diversity does not. Simulations with AI agents confirm these findings.

Conclusion: Successful collaborations leverage common language to integrate diverse experiences and provoke innovation, with implications for team assembly and research policy.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

TL;DR: We introduce improved static word embeddings for better sentence semantic representation using pre-trained Sentence Transformer, sentence-level PCA, knowledge distillation/contrastive learning. The method is efficient and competitive on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance static word embeddings for sentence semantic tasks.

Method: Extract word embeddings from Sentence Transformer, refine with sentence-level PCA, then apply knowledge distillation or contrastive learning.

Result: The model performs better than existing static models and rivals SimCSE on certain datasets.

Conclusion: Our approach effectively removes irrelevant word embedding components and adjusts vector norms according to word influence on sentence semantics.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Proposed Tool-MVR to enhance large language model's tool use capabilities, improving both performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have limitations in tool planning/invocation and reflection abilities.

Method: Introducing MAMV and EXPLORE to improve tool planning, invocation, and reflection.

Result: Tool-MVR shows superior performance on StableToolBench and RefineToolBench.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR surpasses previous models in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种从原始视频生成音频-视觉语音识别数据集的新方法，该方法能够有效提高非英语语言的语音识别性能，尤其是在嘈杂环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-视觉语音识别(AVSR)因其对噪声的鲁棒性而受到广泛关注，但传统的仅依赖音频特征的语音识别系统在嘈杂环境中常遇到挑战。尽管有此优势，AVSR模型仍受限于广泛数据集的匮乏，特别是对于英语以外的大多数语言。

Method: 提出一种从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的实际方法，改进现有技术以提高效率和可访问性。

Result: 通过开发越南语的基线AVSR模型展示了其广泛应用性。实验表明，自动收集的数据集在干净条件下实现了与稳健ASR相当的性能，并且在嘈杂环境如鸡尾酒会中显著优于它们。

Conclusion: 这种方法为将AVSR扩展到更多语言，特别是资源匮乏的语言提供了途径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

### [33] [TaDA: Training-free recipe for Decoding with Adaptive KV Cache Compression and Mean-centering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04642)
*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free recipe called TaDA is introduced for KV cache compression in transformer models which improves accuracy and reduces memory usage without needing to handle outliers separately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory demands scaling poorly with sequence length in transformer models' KV cache and improve scalability of large language models.

Method: TaDA uses quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity across layers and includes a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling.

Result: TaDA reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. It also eliminates the need for separate outlier management.

Conclusion: TaDA provides a way for scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models, potentially enabling inference for longer context length models.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

### [34] [Flex-TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Flexible Planning with Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04649)
*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flex-TravelPlanner, a new benchmark for evaluating language models' planning abilities in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities are limited to static, single-turn scenarios, which do not reflect real-world planning problems that require flexibility and balance.

Method: Flex-TravelPlanner extends the TravelPlanner dataset by introducing two new evaluation settings: sequential constraint introduction across multiple turns and scenarios with prioritized competing constraints.

Result: Analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B shows that models' performance on single-turn tasks does not predict their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns, and models struggle with constraint prioritization.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning scenarios and suggest directions for improving model performance on complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [35] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses the limitations of current methods for aligning large language models with human values, arguing that these methods fail to address vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and proposing that deeper normative reasoning capabilities are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why current alignment strategies for large language models are inadequate and how they can be improved.

Method: Analysis of current alignment strategies and comparison with human moral psychology to identify deficiencies.

Result: Current alignment methods focus on surface-level behavior rather than deep normative reasoning, making models vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Deeper normative reasoning capabilities are necessary for more robust alignment of large language models with human values.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

Motivation: To evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and provide a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and correct errors across six distinct scenarios.

Result: Experiments with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding refinement performance.

Conclusion: MMRefine reveals the bottlenecks and factors impeding refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective reasoning enhancement.

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments

### [37] [Recycling the Web: A Method to Enhance Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04689)
*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaling laws suggest that larger language models perform better with bigger models and datasets. However, there's a limit to how much new high-quality data can be obtained due to filtering processes. This paper introduces REWIRE, a method to recycle and enhance low-quality data, which helps improve model performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the 'data wall' in pre-training scaling by finding ways to use low-quality data effectively.

Method: REWIRE is proposed, which involves guided rewriting of discarded texts to make them useful for training.

Result: Experiments showed improvements in performance when using a mix of high-quality raw texts and rewritten texts, outperforming other methods of generating synthetic data.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts through REWIRE could be an effective way to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

### [38] [Cracking the Code: Enhancing Implicit Hate Speech Detection through Coding Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04693)
*Lu Wei,Liangzhi Li,Tong Xiang,Xiao Liu,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for detecting implicit hate speech (im-HS) by creating a taxonomy and using it with large language models (LLMs). It shows improvement in im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current automatic detection methods in identifying subtle forms of hate speech like implicit hate speech.

Method: Introduces a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defines six encoding strategies (codetypes), and presents two methods for integrating codetypes into im-HS detection using LLMs.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the use of codetypes enhances im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective in improving the detection of implicit hate speech across different languages.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces STAND, a model-free speculative decoding approach that accelerates reasoning tasks in language models by leveraging reasoning trajectory redundancy, improving token acceptance rates, and reducing inference latency by 60-65% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between performance and computational resource consumption in reasoning tasks using test-time scaling techniques.

Method: Proposes STAND, which uses stochastic drafting, a logit-based N-gram module, Gumbel-Top-K sampling, and data-driven tree construction to improve token prediction efficiency.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding and outperforms other speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput across various models and tasks.

Conclusion: STAND is a model-free, plug-and-play solution that can accelerate language model reasoning without additional training.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper explores how hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation techniques affect the performance of the SeamlessM4T model for low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi speech translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve translation quality in low-resource settings.

Method: Fine-tuning the SeamlessM4T model, systematic investigation of hyperparameters, applying speed perturbation and SpecAugment, joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech data.

Result: Careful hyperparameter selection and augmentation techniques significantly enhance performance in low-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: The study reveals that appropriate hyperparameter tuning and effective augmentation can notably boost translation quality in low-resource settings.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An algorithm called SPARTA ALIGNMENT is proposed to collectively align multiple LLMs through competition and combat. It improves performance across most tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diversity in generation and biases in evaluation of a single model.

Method: Multiple LLMs form a 'sparta tribe' to compete and serve as judges for others. A adapted elo-ranking based reputation system is used to aggregate evaluation scores.

Result: SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative and collective competition process and generalizes more effectively to unseen tasks.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly impacted society, resulting in serious consequences.

Method: The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods, effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous emergent fake news scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed C$^2$EFND framework can effectively improve detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous emergent fake news scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

TL;DR: This work explores alternative ways to evaluate text revision in scientific writing by conducting a manual annotation study and investigating reference-free evaluation metrics and LLM-as-a-judge approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics do not capture meaningful improvements in text revision.

Method: Manual annotation study, investigation of reference-free evaluation metrics, examination of LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

Result: LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misalignment between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions, and to avoid concept confounds by extending single-axis concepts to multi-dimensions.

Method: Designing a four-dimensional political learning framework, constructing a corresponding dataset, and applying interpretable representation engineering techniques.

Result: The political concept vectors can disentangle concept confounds, have good semantic meaning, generalization, and robustness, and can intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Conclusion: This work provides a more transparent way to study LLMs' political concept learning, which can help detect and intervene in LLM internals.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

TL;DR: MMSU是一个新基准，用于评估语音理解及推理能力，包含47个任务的5000个精心策划的音频问答三元组。通过测试14种先进SpeechLLMs发现现有模型存在改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SpeechLLMs在处理自然语音中的细粒度感知和复杂推理方面未被充分探索。

Method: 引入了MMSU基准，该基准覆盖多种语言现象并评估了多个高级SpeechLLMs。

Result: 研究发现现有SpeechLLMs在语音理解方面有显著提升空间，并为未来优化指明方向。

Conclusion: MMSU为更全面地评估语音理解建立了新标准，并推动了更复杂的语音交互系统的发展。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Method: Examining methods for transforming and aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space, proposing a classification framework based on architectural strategies, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.

Result: Identifying emerging patterns in the field by analyzing 125 MLLMs developed between 2021 and 2025.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration techniques and aims to guide the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained foundations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

### [48] [Design of intelligent proofreading system for English translation based on CNN and BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04811)
*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合方法，结合CNN和BERT，用于机器翻译校对，显著提高了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自动翻译可能包含需要大量人工后期编辑的错误，因此机器翻译校对对于提高质量至关重要。

Method: 该方法结合了卷积神经网络（CNN）和双向Transformer编码器表示（BERT），通过CNN提取短语和表达式的语义信息，使用多种卷积核滤波器捕获局部n-gram模式，而BERT则利用堆叠的双向变压器编码器创建整个序列的上下文丰富的表示。此外，使用BERT的注意力机制来关联标记以发现翻译异常，并使用平行英语-德语对齐和GRU解码器模型与翻译记忆库一起提出保持原始含义的逻辑修改。

Result: 该方法在多领域WMT集合和Open-Subtitles的对话式字幕的英德平行语料库上进行了训练，实验结果表明其在识别和修正错误翻译及遗漏方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 实验达到了90%的准确率，F1得分为89.37%，均方误差为16.24%，超过了最近的校对技术至少10%，在识别和连贯地纠正错误翻译和遗漏方面展示了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on handwritten exam responses from 646 grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of VLM and LLM in real-world classroom settings, especially in underrepresented educational contexts.

Method: Evaluation of VLM and LLM performance on handwritten exam responses covering Mathematics and English subjects.

Result: VLM struggles with recognizing student handwriting, causing errors in downstream LLM grading, but LLM-generated feedback still has utility despite personalization and contextual relevance limitations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges and potential of using VLM and LLM in educational assessment.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work presents an LLM-based reasoning system that solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesising answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and using a verifier system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a new state-of-the-art performance on solving cryptic crossword clues.

Method: An LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that hypothesises answers, proposes wordplay explanations, and uses a verifier system.

Result: Establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and The Telegraph newspapers in the UK.

Conclusion: Each proved solution is expressed in Python, allowing interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers to be inspected.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [51] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce RACE, a new framework designed to improve hallucination detection in Large Reasoning Models by analyzing their reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods mainly focus on answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical inconsistencies in the reasoning trace of LRMs.

Method: RACE extracts essential reasoning steps and computes four diagnostic signals including inter-sample consistency of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning.

Result: Experiments show that RACE surpasses existing baselines in hallucination detection across various datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: RACE, a novel framework for hallucination detection in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), shows superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents MockConf, a dataset of student interpreting, and InterAlign, a tool for parallel word and span annotations, to study simultaneous interpreting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and later reproduce the dynamic and complex task of simultaneous interpreting automatically.

Method: The method involves collecting data from Mock Conferences and implementing InterAlign for parallel word and span annotations.

Result: The result is a dataset containing 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words, along with a tool for automatic alignment and proposed metrics for evaluation.

Conclusion: This paper introduces MockConf, a student interpreting dataset, and InterAlign, a modern web-based annotation tool.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the effectiveness of different Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for educational assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual creation of MCQs is resource-intensive and time-consuming for educators, so the authors aim to explore if LLMs can help by generating more effective MCQs.

Method: A comparative analysis was conducted on three LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5) using a controlled prompting technique that injects knowledge into the prompt to avoid hallucinations.

Result: GPT-3.5 generated the most effective MCQs based on several metrics.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in improving the educational experience through automated MCQ generation, although there is some resistance to adopting AI in education.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores isometric machine translation using eight open-source large language models across multiple language pairs. It investigates prompt strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection's impact on translation quality and length control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the effectiveness of isometric machine translation across multiple language pairs under specific conditions.

Method: Using eight open-source large language models, exploring different prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration selection.

Result: The phrasing of instructions influences output length. Few-shot prompting enhances translation quality, but improvements are marginal. Considering multiple outputs improves the trade-off between length and quality for some language pairs.

Conclusion: This study finds that instruction phrasing, few-shot prompting, and considering multiple outputs play key roles in improving isometric machine translation.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores whether incorporating Universal Dependencies (UD) into pretrained language models can enhance their performance on cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification tasks. Results show significant improvements in accuracy and F1 scores, reducing the gap between different types of models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of Universal Dependencies in improving the performance of pretrained language models on cross-lingual tasks.

Method: Integrating UD into pretrained language models and evaluating their performance on cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification tasks.

Result: Incorporation of UD leads to significant accuracy and F1 score improvements, with average gains of 3.85% and 6.08% respectively. It also reduces the performance gap between pretrained models and large language models, and outperforms the latter in some cases. Additionally, the UD-based similarity score between a language and English correlates positively with model performance in that language.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the validity and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ICPC-Eval, a competitive coding benchmark for evaluating large language models' reasoning capabilities, including 118 curated problems and a new evaluation metric, Refine@K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics fail to adequately evaluate the coding and reflective abilities of large language models in competitive environments.

Method: Developed ICPC-Eval with curated problems, robust test case generation, local evaluation toolkit, and a new evaluation metric, Refine@K.

Result: Top-tier reasoning models require multi-turn code feedback to reach their full potential, and they still lag behind top human teams despite recent advancements in code generation.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval provides a challenging and realistic environment to probe the frontiers of large language model reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark called Verbose ListOps tests the ability of large language models to manage nested reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test nested narrative reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Verbose ListOps programmatically transforms ListOps computations into lengthy stories.

Result: Leading LLMs perform poorly on Verbose ListOps despite excelling at raw ListOps equations.

Conclusion: Addressing the issue of state management in nested sub-reasoning is crucial for real-world text interpretation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the belief that fine-tuning an existing multilingual end-to-end model is the most effective approach for developing ASR systems for low-resource languages. It proposes a combination of hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models, which performs better with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective approach for ASR systems in low-resource languages.

Method: Combining hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models.

Result: Achieved WER reductions of 32% relative over the best fine-tuned Whisper model on Scottish Gaelic.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms the fine-tuning approach for low-resource languages.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

TL;DR: This study explores the use of large language models to provide multilingual instructional support, particularly for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the ability of large language models to provide effective instructional support across different languages.

Method: Simulating multilingual tutor-student interactions using large language models with different prompting strategies.

Result: Multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, especially in low-resource languages when feedback aligns with the student's native language.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for developing effective and inclusive multilingual, LLM-based educational tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

It investigates various methods including vision-language models and contextual information integration to enhance translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address word ambiguity and context issues in NMT, particularly in domain-specific applications like e-commerce with unclear sentences or poor data quality.

Method: Creating a new dataset named ConECT with 11,400 sentence pairs, testing vision-language models, and exploring ways to incorporate contextual information into text-to-text models.

Result: Incorporating contextual information improves machine translation quality.

Conclusion: Adding contextual information, such as images and product metadata, enhances translation performance in NMT.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Method: Testing multiple large language models on translated algorithm exams.

Result: Recent models perform as well as top students and offer robust reasoning, except for graph-based tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in educational settings by generating quality content and enhancing feedback for students.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of

reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to
top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on
complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain

Motivation: Fine-tuning ASR models in specific domains is challenging when labeled data is scarce.

Method: An incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary dataset from a related domain, followed by filtering pseudo-labels based on multi-model consensus or NER.

Result: Relative improvement of 4% over no auxiliary data, up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection.

Conclusion: Consensus-based filtering outperforms other methods, while NER is the second-best filter with competitive performance at a lower computational cost.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower

Method: SCOP includes a systematic definition of five requisite skills, a framework to construct testing data for these skills, and detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the testing data.

Result: LLMs face challenges in achieving expert-level comprehension, share some similarities with experts, and can be unreliable due to potentially flawed comprehension processes.

Conclusion: Future improvement of LLMs should focus on developing all comprehension skills thoroughly during training.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

TL;DR: This paper presents a simple approach to control the length of text summaries by adjusting the importance of the EOS token in the loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text length control often require complex model changes, which limit their use with pre-trained models.

Method: The method involves increasing the importance of correctly predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss calculation.

Result: The proposed method works well with both encoder-decoder and GPT-style language models, allowing for length control without sacrificing summary quality.

Conclusion: This approach is architecture-agnostic, decoding algorithm-independent, and compatible with other inference-time techniques for length control.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型可能在简单的推理任务中表现不佳，需要一种新的方法来评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 通过多轮并行流的基于LLM的重写和验证生成数学问题变体。

Result: AR-Checker在GSM8K和MATH-500数据集上表现出色，并在MMLU、MMLU-Pro和CommonsenseQA基准测试中也取得了良好的成绩。

Conclusion: AR-Checker是一个有效的框架，可以动态生成基准变体，从而最小化数据污染的风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Motivation: To address the challenge faced by LLMs in handling low-resource languages due to insufficient training data.

Method: TALL combines an LLM with bilingual translation models, uses dimension alignment layers and custom transformers to maintain linguistic features, and applies a parameter-efficient strategy to train only lightweight adapter modules.

Result: Experiments on Hebrew showed significant improvements over several baselines, proving the effectiveness of TALL.

Conclusion: TALL demonstrates the potential of enhancing LLM performance in low-resource languages by integrating translation models and employing a parameter-efficient training strategy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle

TL;DR: Introducing Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel benchmark for LLM judges, exploring cognitive abilities with over 600 annotated debate speeches, and finding that while larger models can approximate individual human judgments, they differ in overall judgment behavior; frontier LLMs can generate persuasive speeches at a human level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing LLM judges, which involves a unique set of cognitive abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM benchmarking.

Method: Leveraging a dataset of over 600 meticulously annotated debate speeches and conducting an in-depth analysis of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on evaluating debate speeches.

Result: Larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some respects but differ substantially in their overall judgment behavior. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive, opinionated speeches performing at a human level.

Conclusion: The study concludes that larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some respects but differ substantially in their overall judgment behavior. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive, opinionated speeches performing at a human level.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines whether large language models can produce introspective self-reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs as they become more linguistically fluent and cognitively capable.

Method: Presenting and critiquing two examples of apparent introspective self-reports from LLMs.

Result: In the first example, an LLM's attempt at describing its creative writing process was not considered valid introspection. However, in the second example, the LLM's correct inference of its own temperature parameter was seen as a minimal legitimate example of introspection.

Conclusion: The study suggests that while some self-reports from LLMs might qualify as introspection, it likely lacks conscious experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

TL;DR: Investigate the poor performance of combining RLHF with colloquial subtitle translation tasks in large language models and propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that enhances translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The poor performance of combining RLHF with colloquial subtitle translation tasks in large language models.

Method: Propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM and incorporates quantitative preference reward into the RM.

Result: Significantly improves upon translation baselines through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: RIVAL can effectively close the gap between the offline reward model and the online LLM, improving translation quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

TL;DR: 本研究通过提出新的数据集和矩阵来增强大语言模型对自我伤害意图的理解，并且在多种场景下验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的自我伤害检测对于早期干预和心理健康支持至关重要，但由于表达方式的微妙性和依赖上下文的特性而具有挑战性。当前的大语言模型（LLMs）难以解释隐含线索在随意语言和表情符号中的含义。

Method: 提出了一种统一框架：a) 使用CESM-100丰富输入；b) 对LLMs进行多任务微调：自我伤害检测（主要）和CM/SI跨度检测（辅助）；c) 生成自我伤害预测的可解释理由。

Result: 在三种最先进的LLMs（Llama 3、Mental-Alpaca和MentalLlama）上评估了该框架，在零样本、少量样本和微调场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过结合意图区分与情境线索，我们的方法在检测和解释任务中显著提升了LLMs的表现，有效地解决了自我伤害信号中的固有模糊性。

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

TL;DR: This study uses AI to evaluate factors like vehicle density, greenery, and cleanliness affecting commercial vitality in Chinese neighborhoods, suggesting optimal configurations for better walkability and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how street-level features impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Chinese communities.

Method: An image-based framework using street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B) to create a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) and analyze its relationship with spatial attributes via GPT-4-based perception modeling.

Result: Moderate vehicle presence can enhance commercial access but excessive on-street parking reduces walkability and satisfaction. Higher greenery and cleanliness improve satisfaction but have weak associations with pricing. Street width moderates vehicle presence effects.

Conclusion: AI-assisted perception combined with urban morphological analysis can capture complex drivers of commercial success, offering insights for urban design and revitalization.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的误导性文本可能导致公众误解、社会恐慌甚至经济损失，因此需要提高检测准确性。

Method: 1. 使用对比学习算法提升模型对真实与误导性文本语义差异的学习能力；2. 引入隐式立场推理模块探索文本中的潜在立场倾向及其与相关主题的关系；3. 将两种算法整合成新框架CL-ISR。

Conclusion: 提出的新框架CL-ISR结合对比学习和隐式立场推理，显著提高了社交媒体上误导性文本检测的效果。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Motivation: To address the limitations of BERT and wav2vec 2.0 in spoken language assessment.

Method: Integrating wav2vec 2.0 with Phi-4 multimodal large language model using a score fusion strategy.

Result: Achieved an RMSE of 0.375 on the official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The proposed system improves spoken language assessment by combining acoustic and semantic information.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

TL;DR: DiCoRe is a new method for Zero-shot Event Detection which improves performance by using divergent and convergent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve zero-shot Event Detection for specialized domains.

Method: Proposes DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that uses Dreamer and Grounder to encourage divergent and convergent reasoning respectively.

Result: Achieves 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline in experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs.

Conclusion: DiCoRe is a strong zero-shot Event Detection framework.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a quantitative framework to investigate inductive biases in neural language models, introducing m-local entropy as a measure of local uncertainty in language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether the inductive biases of neural language models align with human processing constraints.

Method: Proposes m-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context surprisal, to quantify local uncertainty in language. Conducts experiments on perturbed natural language corpora and languages defined by probabilistic finite-state automata.

Result: Finds that languages with higher m-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM language models to learn, suggesting that neural language models are sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Conclusion: Neural language models exhibit sensitivity to the local statistical structure of a language, similar to human processing constraints.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Motivation: 理解大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的内部机制对于解释其行为和提高性能至关重要。

Method: 通过对三个最先进的LALMs应用词汇投影，追踪属性信息在层和标记位置之间的演变过程。

Result: 发现当识别失败时，属性信息通常会随着层数的增加而减少，并且在较早的层解决属性与更好的准确性相关联。此外，LALMs严重依赖查询听觉输入来预测属性，而不是在属性提及的位置在隐藏状态中聚合必要信息。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果提供了对听觉属性处理的见解，为未来的改进铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) were compared with human evaluations of image description errors. Humans judged different error types with varying severity, while most LLMs did not replicate this pattern. Doubao showed human-like error severity rankings but lacked clarity, and surprisingly, DeepSeek-V3 performed best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in image descriptions.

Method: Systematically comparing human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled semantic errors in both unimodal and multimodal settings.

Result: Humans assign different severities to various error types, visual context amplifies severity for some errors. Most LLMs don't match human judgments; Doubao shows human-like rankings but lacks clarity; DeepSeek-V3 performs best.

Conclusion: LLMs have not fully replicated human error severity judgments due to differences in social norm internalization and perceptual grounding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

*Chenyu Lin,Yilin Wen,Du Su,Fei Sun,Muhan Chen,Chenfu Bao,Zhonghou Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Knowledgeable-r1, which improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by balancing reliance on retrieved contexts and leveraging the model's inherent knowledge, enhancing robustness and reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems overly rely on retrieved contexts, potentially leading to inaccuracies and overlooking the model's own knowledge, especially in misleading or excessive information scenarios.

Method: Knowledgeable-r1 uses joint sampling and defines multi-policy distributions to explore knowledge capabilities, encouraging self-integrated use of parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Experiments show Knowledgeable-r1 enhances robustness and reasoning accuracy in various tasks, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios and showing consistent improvements in RAG tasks.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances reliance on retrieved contexts and the model's inherent knowledge, leading to improved performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analyze the bias representation in LLMs like GPT-2 and Llama2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social, demographic, and gender biases are represented in LLMs due to training data.

Method: Use mechanistic interpretability to find internal edges causing bias and study their stability and localization.

Result: Bias-related computations are highly localized in a few layers and change with fine-tuning. Removing them reduces biased outputs but also impacts other NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Bias components are localized and shared with other NLP tasks, removal impacts multiple functionalities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality and ensuring correct evidence support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, limiting the performance in LLM-based RAG.

Method: ECoRAG compresses retrieved documents based on evidentiality and ensures whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence.

Result: ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks and is highly cost-efficient.

Conclusion: ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks and outperforms existing compression methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote

TL;DR: Large-scale neural language models can perform in-context counterfactual reasoning, which is the ability to predict the consequences of changes under hypothetical scenarios. This study focuses on a linear regression task requiring noise abduction and finds that self-attention, model depth, and data diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the capability of large-scale neural language models in performing in-context counterfactual reasoning, specifically in a controlled setup of a linear regression task requiring noise abduction.

Method: Studying the linear regression task that requires noise abduction and analyzing the factors driving performance in Transformers such as self-attention, model depth, and data diversity in pre-training.

Result: Language models are capable of counterfactual reasoning in the controlled setup, and it is found that certain factors in Transformer models contribute to their performance.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into the capability of language models in counterfactual reasoning and suggests potential applications in counterfactual story generation.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RELIC, a framework for evaluating large language models' instruction-following abilities through language recognition tasks. It finds that even advanced LLMs struggle with complex grammars and rely on heuristics rather than instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust evaluation method for large language models' instruction-following capabilities that can scale with model improvements and avoid data contamination.

Method: Introducing the RELIC framework which evaluates LLMs using language recognition tasks involving synthetic grammars.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show poor accuracy on complex grammars and samples, relying on heuristics rather than instructions as task difficulty increases.

Conclusion: The RELIC framework provides a scalable way to assess LLMs' instruction-following abilities, revealing limitations in current models' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Common Pile v0.1, an open-source dataset for large language model pretraining, which is validated by training two competitive LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing intellectual property and ethical concerns related to training large language models on unlicensed texts by using openly licensed text.

Method: Collecting, curating, and releasing an eight terabyte dataset called Common Pile v0.1 comprising diverse openly licensed text from 30 sources.

Result: Two 7 billion parameter LLMs trained on the Common Pile achieved competitive performance compared to LLMs trained on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 dataset and trained models are released along with the code and training mixture, contributing to the development of performant LLMs on openly licensed text.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

TL;DR: Self-supervised methods for character-level tasks like morphological inflection can be effective even in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks for morphological inflection in low-resource settings.

Method: Training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.

Result: Autoencoding performs best with limited data while CMLM becomes more effective as data availability increases. Objectives with strong inductive biases rarely outperform standard CMLM, but using masks based on morpheme boundaries improves performance.

Conclusion: Sampling masks based on morpheme boundaries is a promising direction for low-resource morphological modeling.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified system of representation for both continuous and discontinuous structures in natural languages using concepts from Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified approach to analyzing syntactic discontinuity and continuity across various languages.

Method: Proposes a unified system by considering Phrase Structure Grammar for constituency, Dependency Grammar for head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar for functor-argument relations.

Result: Shows that discontinuous expressions and continuous structures can be analyzed through a unified mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Conclusion: Concludes with a unified system of representation for both continuous and discontinuous structures in natural languages.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work proposes a 3-step reasoning process for hallucination detection, which improves the performance by allowing models to make finer-grained and more accurate entailment decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of entailment classification suggests that LLMs could benefit from generating an explicit reasoning process.

Method: A 3-step reasoning process including claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and aggregated classification is proposed.

Result: Guided reasoning yields improved hallucination detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed analysis scheme provides additional empirical evidence for the improved quality of the guided reasoning scheme.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Motivation: 解决Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)系统中存在的Knowledge Conflicts问题，即外部知识与大语言模型的固有知识相矛盾的问题，影响下游任务如问答(QA)的表现。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架，具有分层动作空间，能够自动感知上下文复杂性并自适应地将每个知识源分解为一系列细粒度比较，这些比较被表示为可操作步骤，使推理超越表面上下文。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，Micro-Act在所有5个数据集和3种冲突类型上的QA准确性显著提高，特别是在时间型和语义型冲突中，所有基线方法表现都显著较差。此外，Micro-Act在非冲突问题上也表现出稳健的性能。

Conclusion: Micro-Act框架有效解决了RAG系统的Knowledge Conflicts问题，并且在非冲突问题上也有良好的表现，显示出其在实际RAG应用中的实用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Conclusion: 这种方法不仅提升了准确性，还使较小的模型能够匹配较大的模型性能，展示了其在高效且可扩展的AI部署方面的潜力，并促进了高性能AI的普及。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Motivation: To address the challenges of unlearning sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information from large language models without degrading performance on retained data.

Method: Formulating unlearning as a constrained optimization problem with a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, solved using a primal-dual algorithm.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across various LLM architectures, demonstrating effective targeted information removal while preserving downstream utility.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel approach to unlearning in large language models, which is more stable and efficient than previous methods, and shows promising results in practical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Motivation: Existing datasets for search-augmented language models are limited in scale and scope, focusing mainly on static, single-turn fact-checking questions. There is a need for a more comprehensive dataset to evaluate these models effectively.

Method: The method involves creating a crowd-sourced dataset named Search Arena with over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions, analyzing user preferences based on cited sources and credibility, and conducting cross-arena analyses for performance assessment.

Result: The results show that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations and vary across cited sources. Web search can improve performance in non-search settings but affects quality in search settings when relying solely on the model's parametric knowledge.

Conclusion: This paper introduces Search Arena, a large-scale dataset for evaluating search-augmented language models, revealing insights into user preferences and performance across various settings.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: Language models often misunderstand human preferences due to biases in their training data. This study examines how five specific language generation biases affect these models' preferences and finds significant miscalibration. A proposed method using counterfactual data augmentation improves model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the issue of language models being biased towards superficial features rather than substantive qualities in human preference judgments.

Method: Systematically investigating the relationship between training data biases and preference model miscalibration using controlled counterfactual pairs.

Result: Preference models favor biased responses in over 60% of cases, with high miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Bias features have weak negative correlations with human preferences but strong positive correlations with model preferences.

Conclusion: A post-training method using counterfactual data augmentation effectively reduces miscalibration and skew differences in preference models, improving reliability without sacrificing overall performance.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

### [94] [Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04245)
*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores ensuring contextual integrity (CI) for autonomous agents, proposing an approach that combines explicit reasoning by large language models (LLMs) and a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. It demonstrates reduced inappropriate information disclosure while preserving task performance across different model sizes and families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring contextual integrity (CI) becomes crucial as autonomous agents make decisions on behalf of users, requiring reasoning about the context in which they operate.

Method: The method involves prompting LLMs to reason explicitly about CI and developing an RL framework to instill necessary reasoning capabilities. A synthetic dataset was used to train and evaluate the models.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduced inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families, with improvements transferring to established CI benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining explicit reasoning and reinforcement learning to achieve contextual integrity in autonomous agents.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

TL;DR: Introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates a knowledge graph for the circular economy to enhance large language model's performance in sustainable manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of large language models often hallucinating industrial codes and emission factors which can negatively impact regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: Developing a retrieval-augmented generation framework named CircuGraphRAG that uses a domain-specific knowledge graph containing 117,380 industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission data to enable structured multi-hop reasoning.

Result: CircuGraphRAG outperforms standalone LLMs and naive RAG in single-hop and multi-hop question answering with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0 compared to baseline scores below 0.08. It also improves efficiency by halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG offers fact-checked, regulatory-ready support for circular economy planning, promoting reliable, low-carbon resource decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current methods for automated scientific discovery generate many hypotheses but running corresponding experiments can be costly. This paper introduces Matter-of-Fact, a dataset of 8.4k scientific claims across materials science topics, showing that existing models struggle with assessing hypothesis feasibility despite domain experts finding them solvable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of automated scientific discovery by filtering feasible hypotheses before running potentially expensive experiments.

Method: Introducing Matter-of-Fact, a dataset containing claims from scientific literature and code/simulation results across four materials science fields.

Result: Strong baselines including retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation only reached 72% performance, below domain expert verification which suggested near all claims were solvable.

Conclusion: This highlights the challenge for current models in assessing hypothesis feasibility and the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discovery with near-term model improvements.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Motivation: To address the reliability and reproducibility issues in evaluating these models' performance.

Method: Empirical assessment of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Result: Significant fluctuations in evaluation results due to varying conditions.

Conclusion: Advocates for a stricter evaluation paradigm for model performance.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

TL;DR: This paper studies strategic deception in large language models with chain-of-thought reasoning, proposing methods to induce, detect, and control such deception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of strategic deception in advanced LLMs which can intentionally provide misinformation contrary to their reasoning.

Method: Using representation engineering, including Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) for detecting deception vectors and activation steering to elicit context-appropriate deception.

Result: Achieved 89% detection accuracy of deceptive outputs and a 40% success rate in eliciting appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: This work identifies a specific honesty-related issue in reasoning models and provides tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）系统所带来的表征伤害的工具未能满足从业者的实际需求。

Method: 通过与12名从业者进行半结构化访谈来研究这一问题。

Result: 发现从业者通常无法使用公开提供的衡量表征伤害的工具，主要因为工具没有有意义地衡量他们想要衡量的内容或者与他们的需求不一致；另外，即使是有用的工具，由于实际和制度障碍也未被采用。

Conclusion: 建议根据测量理论和实用测量理论提出解决这些挑战的建议以更好地满足从业者的需要。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

TL;DR: We present ReXVQA, the largest VQA benchmark in chest radiology with diverse tasks. MedGemma performs best with 83.24% accuracy, surpassing human experts (77.27%) in a reader study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more comprehensive and clinically authentic VQA benchmark for chest radiology.

Method: Created ReXVQA with diverse tasks and evaluated eight state-of-the-art models.

Result: MedGemma achieved the highest accuracy of 83.24%, outperforming human experts in a reader study.

Conclusion: ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems and paves the way for advanced AI models that can mimic expert clinical reasoning.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

*Hien Ohnaka,Yuma Shirahata,Byeongseon Park,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Propose a model to generate coherent phonemic and prosodic labels with graphemes for speech, improving consistency and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the consistency between graphemes and predicted labels in speech processing tasks.

Method: Condition label generation on graphemes via prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features and pruning inconsistent label hypotheses during inference.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement in consistency between graphemes and predicted labels, and effective improvement in accent estimation accuracy using the created parallel data.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances the quality of speech processing and is applicable to various downstream tasks like text-to-speech and accent estimation.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的音素到字母解码方法（LLM-P2G），并在波兰语和德语的跨语言自动语音识别任务中取得了比传统WFST解码更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于音素的多语言预训练和跨语言微调在自动语音识别（ASR）中具有高效的数据利用率和有竞争力的结果，但基于加权有限状态转换器（WFST）的解码受限于其复杂的管道以及无法利用大型语言模型（LLMs）。

Method: 提出了基于大型语言模型的音素到字母的解码方法（LLM-P2G），包括语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字母（P2G）。同时为了应对级联S2P和P2G时的信息丢失问题，提出两种训练策略：带有噪声音素的数据增强（DANP）和随机化顶部-$K$边缘化（TKM）训练与解码。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM-P2G在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR任务中，相对WER分别减少了3.6%和6.9%。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G在跨语言ASR任务上优于WFST系统，在波兰语和德语上的相对WER分别降低了3.6%和6.9%。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Many studies try to improve systematic generalization in ML models, but they often confuse systematicity of representations with systematicity of behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To emphasize the important distinction between systematicity of representations and systematicity of behavior.

Method: Analyze key benchmarks in the literature across language and vision and discuss ways of assessing systematicity of representations in ML models.

Result: Existing benchmarks and models mainly focus on systematicity of behavior rather than systematicity of representations.

Conclusion: The distinction between systematicity of representations and systematicity of behavior is crucial and needs more attention.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new differentially private language model inference approach that improves the quality of privately generated text by clustering input data and using a median-based aggregation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous topics.

Method: Clustering the input data before selecting inference batches and aggregating next token statistics by privately computing medians instead of averages.

Result: Improvements in terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Our method produces high-quality synthetic data at significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Method: Employing a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword extraction methods like frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided approaches with differential privacy tools such as clustering, partition selection, and histogram-based summarization.

Result: The framework preserves lexical and semantic content, maintains pair similarity, and achieves better privacy robustness than a non-private Clio-inspired pipeline.

Conclusion: Urania successfully extracts meaningful conversational insights while preserving strict user privacy, achieving a balance between data utility and privacy protection.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided

Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair

Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively

Method: Transforms EHR data into a structured representation and uses a novel summary mechanism.

Result: EHR2Path performs well in predicting future health trajectories and simulating patient paths.

Conclusion: This work opens possibilities for predictive and personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse uses zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to enhance sparse retrieval performance, outperforming other methods on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of using large language models in query expansion for information retrieval.

Method: Introduce a novel fusion ranking framework called Exp4Fuse which enhances the performance of sparse retrievers through zero-shot LLM-based query expansion.

Result: Experimental results show Exp4Fuse improves sparse retrievers and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods and achieves SOTA results on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer introduces a novel method using smaller LMs for query expansion, outperforming other smaller LM methods and remaining competitive with large LLM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and computational intensity of LLM-based query expansion while maintaining performance.

Method: GOLFer includes a hallucination filter and a documents combiner to handle generated documents from smaller LMs.

Result: GOLFer performs better than other methods using smaller LMs and competitively against large LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: GOLFer demonstrates effectiveness in query expansion tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### [109] [Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04397)
*Ariadna Sanchez,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study investigates the use of a state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, for personalized text-to-speech synthesis in individuals with dysarthria. The aim is to generate intelligible speech while preserving speaker identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a communication aid for individuals with speech disorders by creating a personalized text-to-speech system that maintains both intelligibility and speaker identity.

Method: Using a curated dataset annotated with speaker and intelligibility information, the Parler TTS model was fine-tuned to generate approximations of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior to the onset of their condition.

Result: The model successfully learned to generate from the challenging dataset but had difficulty controlling intelligibility and maintaining consistent speaker identity.

Conclusion: Future improvements in controlling this class of models are proposed for better performance in voice reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

### [110] [Towards Efficient Speech-Text Jointly Decoding within One Speech Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04518)
*Haibin Wu,Yuxuan Hu,Ruchao Fan,Xiaofei Wang,Kenichi Kumatani,Bo Ren,Jianwei Yu,Heng Lu,Lijuan Wang,Yao Qian,Jinyu Li*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper compares different joint speech-text decoding strategies and proposes an early-stop interleaved pattern to enhance performance and efficiency in speech-text modelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving performance, efficiency, and alignment quality in end-to-end speech-text modelling within a single model for spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Systematically comparing representative joint speech-text decoding strategies under a controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer and training data.

Result: The interleaved approach achieves the best alignment but has slow inference due to long token sequence length. The proposed early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern accelerates decoding and improves performance.

Conclusion: The interleaved approach provides the best alignment among the compared joint speech-text decoding strategies.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

### [111] [EMO-Debias: Benchmarking Gender Debiasing Techniques in Multi-Label Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04652)
*Yi-Cheng Lin,Huang-Cheng Chou,Yu-Hsuan Li Liang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper presents EMO-Debias, a comprehensive comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to multi-label speech emotion recognition (SER). It evaluates these methods on acted and naturalistic datasets with imbalanced gender data, analyzing fairness vs. accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in multi-label SER systems that often exhibit gender bias.

Method: Comparative evaluation of 13 debiasing techniques from pre-processing, regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally robust optimization on WavLM and XLSR representations.

Result: Identified methods that reduce gender performance gaps without significantly affecting overall model performance, providing insights into fairness vs. accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of considering dataset distributions when selecting debiasing strategies for multi-label SER systems.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.
