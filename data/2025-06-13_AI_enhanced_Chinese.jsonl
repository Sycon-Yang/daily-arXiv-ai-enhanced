Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments.

A natural question that arises is how\neffectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question\nby investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types\nof unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to\nthe question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different\nquestion, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are\neffective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from\nthe same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing\nsignificant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of\nreasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their\nself-reevaluation abilities are far from a general \"meta-cognitive\" awareness.\nMoreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle\nmore than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when\ninstructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of\nthese findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,\nshowing that the smallest models are the least distracted by\nharmful-response-triggering thoughts.

We\nconceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to\nproficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual\nqueries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical\nthree-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,\nensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all\nproposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\\% to 60\\% over\nthe baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information\ntransfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/", "AI": {"tldr": "Integrating audio perception into Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant progress in Audio-LLMs. However, the underlying mechanisms of transferring semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain unclear.
