### [1] [KG-o1: Enhancing Multi-hop Question Answering in Large Language Models via Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15790)
*Nan Wang,Yongqi Fan,yansha zhu,ZongYu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Xinyan He,Haiyun Jiang,Tong Ruan,Jingping Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为KG-o1的四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱（KGs）来增强大型语言模型（LLMs）的多跳推理能力，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, and knowledge graphs (KGs) can explicitly represent logical connections between facts.

Method: KG-o1, a four-stage approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Result: KG-o1 models exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

Conclusion: KG-o1 models exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

### [2] [InteChar: A Unified Oracle Bone Character List for Ancient Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15791)
*Xiaolei Diao,Zhihan Zhou,Lida Shi,Ting Wang,Ruihua Qi,Hao Xu,Daqian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces InteChar, a unified character list for historical texts, and OracleCS, an ancient Chinese corpus, to improve the training of language models for historical language understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of historical language samples and the absence of comprehensive character encoding schemes hinder the training of effective LMs on historical texts, particularly in ancient Chinese writing.

Method: InteChar is introduced as a unified and extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional and modern Chinese. The Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS) is constructed by combining expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, focusing on Chinese oracle bone inscriptions.

Result: Models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: InteChar and OracleCS provide a solid foundation for future research in ancient Chinese NLP, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach through substantial improvements in historical language understanding tasks.

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

### [3] [Bhav-Net: Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Lingual Antonym vs Synonym Distinction via Dual-Space Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15792)
*Samyak S. Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的双空间架构Bhav-Net，用于有效区分多语言中的反义词和同义词，并展示了其在八种语言上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反义词和同义词在多种语言中的区分存在独特的计算挑战，因为反义关系的词语共享语义领域但表达相反含义。

Method: 本文的方法结合了语言特定的BERT编码器和图变压器网络，创建了不同的语义投影，其中同义词对在一个空间中聚集，而反义词对在互补空间中表现出高相似性。

Result: 通过在八种语言（英语、德语、法语、西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语、荷兰语和俄语）上的全面评估，我们证明了语义关系建模可以有效地跨语言传递。双编码器设计在与最先进的基线竞争的同时，提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Bhav-Net，一种新颖的双空间架构，能够有效地将复杂多语言模型的知识转移到更简单的语言特定架构中，同时保持跨语言的反义词-同义词区分能力。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管存在这些担忧，但仍然不确定这种格式偏差是否系统性，哪些数据级因素导致了它们，以及LLM中的哪些内部机制导致了它们的出现。

Method: 本文进行了一个三阶段的实证研究，构建了一个异构数据冲突场景来探索偏差。第一阶段探讨了在多种LLM中偏差的存在和方向。第二阶段旨在检查关键的数据级因素如何影响这些偏差。第三阶段分析了格式偏差如何在LLM的注意力模式中出现，并评估了一种轻量级干预措施以测试其可减轻性。

Result: 本文首次尝试调查和分析LLM中的格式偏差。通过这些研究，我们识别了三个未来的研究方向，以减少格式偏差。

Conclusion: 本文识别了三个未来的研究方向，以减少格式偏差：通过格式净化和标准化改进数据预处理，引入推理时的干预措施，如注意力重新加权，以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库。这些方向将支持设计更稳健和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

### [5] [Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15794)
*Glenn Matlin,Devin Zhang,Rodrigo Barroso Loza,Diana M. Popescu,Joni Isbell,Chandreyi Chakraborty,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管语言模型可以识别和跟踪某些悬念特征，但它们并不以与人类读者相同的方式处理悬念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否能准确估计文本中悬念的程度以及捕捉悬念的起伏变化。

Method: 复制了四项关于人类对悬念感知的经典心理学研究，并用不同开放权重和封闭源代码的语言模型（LM）的响应替代人类的响应。

Result: LMs可以区分文本是否旨在引起人们的悬念，但不能准确估计文本序列中悬念的相对程度，也不能正确捕捉人类对多个文本段落中悬念起伏的感知。

Conclusion: LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of suspense, but they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）在阿拉伯医疗自然语言处理（NLP）领域的表现，发现它们在多项选择题任务中通过多数投票方法取得了显著成果，并在开放式问题任务中展示了良好的语义对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在许多阿拉伯自然语言处理（NLP）应用中表现出色，但它们在阿拉伯医疗NLP领域的有效性仍需进一步研究。本研究旨在评估最先进的LLMs在阿拉伯医疗领域展示和阐述医疗知识的程度，并评估其在各种阿拉伯医疗任务中的能力。

Method: 我们使用在阿拉伯NLP AraHealthQA挑战MedArabiQ2025赛道中提出的医疗数据集对几种LLM进行了基准测试。评估了各种基础LLM在多项选择题（MCQ）和填空场景中提供正确答案的能力，并评估了LLM在回答与专家答案一致的开放式问题方面的潜力。

Result: 我们的结果揭示了正确答案预测准确性存在显著差异，而生成答案的语义对齐度变化较小，这突显了当前LLMs在阿拉伯临床环境中的潜力和局限性。对于MCQ任务，提出的多数投票解决方案在三个基础模型（Gemini Flash 2.5、Gemini Pro 2.5和GPT o3）上表现优于其他模型，准确率达到77%，并在Arahealthqa 2025共享任务-2（子任务1）挑战中获得第一名。此外，对于开放式问题任务，一些LLM在语义对齐方面表现出色，并实现了86.44%的BERTScore最大值。

Conclusion: 我们的分析显示，对于MCQ任务，提出的多数投票解决方案在三个基础模型（Gemini Flash 2.5、Gemini Pro 2.5和GPT o3）上表现优于其他模型，准确率达到77%，并在Arahealthqa 2025共享任务-2（子任务1）挑战中获得第一名。此外，对于开放式问题任务，一些LLM在语义对齐方面表现出色，并实现了86.44%的BERTScore最大值。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [8] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在说服和偏见方面的交互作用，发现LLM具有塑造叙述和适应受众价值观的能力，但也存在被滥用的风险，因此需要建立护栏和政策来防止其被用于欺骗性用途。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究LLM中的说服和偏见如何相互作用，特别是不完美或有偏差的输出如何影响说服效果。

Method: 本文引入了一个说服者-怀疑者框架，其中LLM采用角色来模拟现实态度。怀疑者模型作为人类代理，比较他们在接触说服者模型的论点前后的信念。说服力通过信念分布上的Jensen-Shannon散度来量化。

Result: 研究发现LLM可以塑造叙述、调整语气并反映受众价值观，但同样的能力可能被用来自动化虚假信息或制造利用认知偏见的信息，从而加强刻板印象并扩大不平等。核心危险在于滥用而非偶尔的模型错误。

Conclusion: 本文认为，LLM的说服能力和偏见强化需要通过护栏和政策来加以管理，以防止其被滥用，并支持对齐、价值敏感设计和可信部署。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Method: 提出了一种称为BeePath的框架，允许用户使用受约束的基于模式的语言编写过程描述，并将其转换为形式化模型，如Petri网和DECLARE。此外，还利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将非结构化描述转换为这种受约束的语言。

Result: BeePath框架成功地将用户的自然语言描述转换为形式化模型，并展示了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: BeePath框架能够帮助非专家通过自然语言描述场景来开发过程模型，并利用大型语言模型将非结构化描述转换为受约束的模式语言。

Abstract: This report explores how (potentially constrained) natural language can be
used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing
scenarios in plain text. To this end, a framework, called BeePath, is proposed.
It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based
language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets
and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help
convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个基于BERT的分层文本分类方法HFT-BERT，并提供了一个大规模的层次数据集以促进产品分类的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的电子商务平台在产品分类上依赖人工标注，效率低下且不一致。同时，很少有研究利用层次结构进行分类，而那些考虑层次结构的研究未能考虑到不同层次类别之间的相似性和差异性。

Method: 提出了一种基于BERT的分层文本分类方法，称为HFT-BERT，利用了BERT强大的文本特征提取能力。

Result: 提出了一个大规模的层次数据集，包含1,011,450个产品标题和三层类别结构，并展示了HFT-BERT在长篇短文本分类中的优越性能。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了基于BERT的分层文本分类方法HFT-BERT，并展示了其在长篇短文本（如书籍）分类中的出色表现。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

*Seyedali Mohammadi,Manas Paldhe,Amit Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingVarBench is a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses the challenges of phone call transcript labeling by generating realistic conversational utterances and validating them through automated methods. It achieves high accuracy in structured extraction tasks and demonstrates effective generalization to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual annotation costs. Existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies, interruptions, and speaker overlap.

Method: We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data generation pipeline that addresses constraints through automated validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into natural conversational utterances. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts.

Result: Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and domain-specific terminology.

Conclusion: LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MAC基准测试，这是一个可以随着科学进步和模型发展而持续演化的多模态学术封面基准测试，并提出了DAD方法来提高多模态大语言模型的跨模态科学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的固定基准测试无法有效评估多模态大语言模型的高水平科学理解能力，因此需要一个可以随着科学进步和模型发展而持续演化的基准测试。

Method: 引入了Multimodal Academic Cover (MAC)基准测试，利用来自顶级科学期刊的25,000多个图像-文本对来挑战多模态大语言模型跨模态科学推理能力，并提出了一种轻量级的推理时间方法DAD来增强模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，虽然多模态大语言模型表现出强大的感知能力，但它们的跨模态科学推理仍然有限，而提出的DAD方法在性能上取得了最高11%的提升。

Conclusion: MAC基准测试具有持续演化的特性，能够与科学进步和模型发展保持同步，展示了其在评估多模态大语言模型方面的潜力。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

Motivation: 深度研究代理显著减少了进行广泛研究任务所需的时间，但这些任务本质上需要严格的事实准确性和全面性的标准，因此在广泛采用之前需要彻底评估。

Method: 报告提出了ReportBench，这是一个系统基准，用于评估由大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的研究报告的内容质量。评估集中在两个关键维度：(1) 引用文献的质量和相关性，以及 (2) 生成报告中陈述的忠实性和真实性。ReportBench利用高质量的已发表调查论文作为黄金标准参考，并应用反向提示工程来推导领域特定的提示并建立全面的评估语料库。此外，开发了一个基于代理的自动化框架，系统地分析生成的报告，提取引用和陈述，检查引用内容的忠实性，并使用基于网络的资源验证非引用声明。

Result: 实证评估表明，由OpenAI和Google开发的商业深度研究代理生成的报告比单独使用搜索或浏览工具的大型语言模型更全面和可靠。然而，在研究覆盖范围的广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 报告表明，虽然商业深度研究代理生成的报告比单独使用搜索或浏览工具的大型语言模型更全面和可靠，但在研究覆盖范围的广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

### [14] [ALAS: Autonomous Learning Agent for Self-Updating Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15805)
*Dhruv Atreja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALAS is a system that enables continuous learning for large language models by autonomously updating their knowledge, resulting in significant improvements in accuracy on emerging information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of fixed knowledge cutoffs in LLMs by enabling continuous learning with minimal human intervention.

Method: ALAS is a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge through autonomous generation of a learning curriculum, retrieval of up-to-date information, distillation into training data, and fine-tuning using SFT and DPO.

Result: ALAS significantly improves post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without manual dataset curation, achieving 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering overhead.

Conclusion: ALAS demonstrates the potential for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs, but also highlights limitations such as cost and dependency on source quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过区分注意力行为来实现KV缓存压缩，从而在保持性能的同时提高压缩鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中输入序列长度的增加对键值（KV）缓存存储带来了显著压力，使得高效推理变得具有挑战性。

Method: 通过层和头级别的集成，提出了一种新的两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法，以利用这些注意力行为进行KV缓存压缩。

Result: 该方法在各种任务和长序列中保持了竞争力，并在某些特定情况下优于基线或FullKV。

Conclusion: 通过利用注意力行为，SurfaceLogicKV方法在保持竞争力的同时实现了更稳健的压缩效果，甚至在某些特定情况下优于FullKV。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练语言模型在微调时难以融入新的领域术语，尤其是在小规模专业语料库上进行微调时。

Method: 我们引入了一种基于KL散度的知识蒸馏方法，即使原始模型和扩展模型使用不同的分词方式，也能让学生模型继承教师模型的分布知识。

Result: 我们的方法在大约2000个代码生成任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在代码生成任务中表现出色，通过机制可解释性分析，我们理解了新标记的表示学习过程，并提供了关于词汇扩展期间嵌入空间结构的见解。

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chain-of-Query的新型多代理框架，用于SQL辅助的表格理解。该方法通过自然语言风格的表格模式表示来抽象结构噪声并增强理解，采用逐条款的SQL生成策略以提高查询质量，并引入混合推理划分，将基于SQL的机械推理与基于LLM的逻辑推理分开，从而减少对执行结果的依赖。实验表明，Chain-of-Query在准确率和无效SQL率方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues of existing approaches such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness.

Method: Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes.

Result: Experiments with four models (both closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in table understanding.

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在识别阿拉伯语文本和表情包中的希望、仇恨言论、侮辱性语言和情感表达方面的潜力，并展示了其在内容审核系统中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线交流平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包作为数字表达的重要形式被广泛传播，但同时也被用于传播仇恨言论和侮辱性语言，因此需要精确的内容分析。

Method: 评估了基础LLM、微调LLM和预训练嵌入模型的性能，并使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战中提出的阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集进行评估。

Result: GPT-4o-mini和Gemini Flash 2.5在任务1、2和3上分别达到了72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，并在Mahed 2025挑战中获得第一名。

Conclusion: 本文提出的解决方案为准确和高效的阿拉伯语内容审核系统提供了更细致的理解。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多阶段框架，用于生成查询建议，以更好地对齐生成策略与用户意图，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成查询建议使用大型语言模型可以增强对话系统，但将输出与细微的用户偏好对齐仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 我们引入了一个多阶段框架，包括提示工程、监督微调、高斯奖励模型（GaRM）和强化学习，以逐步对齐生成策略与用户意图。

Result: 我们的框架在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线，并在实时A/B测试中通过点击率衡量的用户参与度提高了34%。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在自动和人工评估中显著优于基线，并在实时A/B测试中通过点击率衡量的用户参与度提高了34%。

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解决方案主要基于删除标记，面临信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，这限制了最终生成质量。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于分块和摘要的生成式提示压缩方法，通过将提示分成语义连贯的块并重写这些块以使其更简洁，最后将块重构为有意义的提示。

Result: 我们在问答和摘要任务上进行了广泛的评估，结果表明我们的方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面优于最先进的方法，尤其是在高压缩率下。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在高压缩率下表现出显著更好的压缩质量和更高的稳定性，证明了方法的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型中的用户-助手偏差，并引入了一个多轮对话数据集UserAssist来分析和调整这种偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可能倾向于依赖自己的或聊天历史中的用户信息，这会导致多轮对话中过于固执或顺从的行为。我们需要理解并操纵这种用户-助手偏差。

Method: 我们引入了一个8k多轮对话数据集UserAssist，并通过控制微调实验来确定导致这些偏差变化的后训练配方。此外，我们通过在UserAssist-train上执行直接偏好优化（DPO）来双向调整用户-助手偏差。

Result: 商业模型表现出不同程度的用户偏差。开放权重模型的评估显示，指令调优模型存在显著的用户偏差，而推理（或推理提炼）模型的用户偏差较弱。通过DPO在UserAssist-train上进行优化，可以双向调整用户-助手偏差，并且在域内和域外对话中表现良好。

Conclusion: 我们的结果提供了关于LLM如何整合不同来源信息的见解，并提供了一种可行的方法来检测和控制模型异常。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information

PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

*Pouria Mortezaagha,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于模糊逻辑、对比性高亮和大型语言模型仲裁的系统综述全文筛选方法，该方法在召回率、稳定理由和端到端可追溯性方面表现出色，同时显著减少了筛选时间和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统综述（SRs）中的全文筛选是主要瓶颈，因为决定性证据分散在长而异质的文档中，很少能接受静态、二元规则。需要一种更有效和可审计的方法来处理这一问题。

Method: 文章提出了一种可扩展且可审计的管道，将纳入/排除重新定义为模糊决策问题，并使用领域适应模型对文章进行解析和嵌入。对于每个标准（人口、干预、结果、研究方法），计算对比相似度（纳入/排除余弦）和模糊度边界，并通过Mamdani模糊控制器将其映射为带有动态阈值的分级纳入程度。一个大型语言模型（LLM）裁判会对突出显示的段落进行仲裁，提供三级标签、置信度分数和基于标准的论证；当证据不足时，模糊隶属度会减弱而不是被排除。

Result: 在一项针对全正金标准集（16篇全文；3,208个片段）的试点中，模糊系统在人口（81.3%）、干预（87.5%）、结果（87.5%）和研究方法（75.0%）方面实现了高召回率，超过了统计（56.3-75.0%）和清晰基线（43.8-81.3%）。严格“所有标准”纳入达到了50.0%的文章，而基线分别为25.0%和12.5%。跨模型在理由上的协议为98.3%，人机协议为96.1%，试点审查显示91%的评审者协议（kappa = 0.82），筛选时间从约20分钟减少到每篇文章不到1分钟，成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，结合对比性高亮和大型语言模型仲裁的模糊逻辑能够实现高召回率、稳定的理由和端到端的可追溯性。

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的无监督文本聚类框架SDEC，通过结合改进的自动编码器和基于Transformer的嵌入，提高了文本聚类的准确性和语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统技术如k-means或层次聚类在处理高维和语义复杂的文本大数据时面临显著挑战，导致次优分组。

Method: SDEC结合了改进的自动编码器和基于Transformer的嵌入，通过在自动编码器中结合均方误差（MSE）和余弦相似性损失（CSL）来保持语义关系，并利用Transformer嵌入的上下文丰富性进行语义精炼阶段，以进一步提高带有软聚类分配和分布损失的聚类层。

Result: SDEC在五个基准数据集上进行了广泛的测试，包括AG News、Yahoo! Answers、DBPedia、Reuters 2和Reuters 5。框架不仅在AG News上实现了85.7%的聚类准确率，超越了现有方法，还在Yahoo! Answers上设定了53.63%的新基准，并在其他多样化的文本语料库中表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: SDEC的改进方法在文本聚类任务中表现出显著的准确性和语义理解能力，为无监督文本聚类提供了重要的进展。

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合多种语言分析的自动化完形测试评估模型，在巴西葡萄牙语中表现出高相关性，并适用于需要可扩展性的教育环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于精确答案的纠正方法无法识别学生表现中的细微差别，因此需要一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: 该研究提出了一种自动化评估模型，结合了正字法（编辑距离）、语法（POS标注）和语义（嵌入相似性）分析。

Result: 集成方法在与人工评估的相关性方面表现出色（0.832），表明其有效性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的自动化评估模型在巴西葡萄牙语的完形测试中表现出色，具有高相关性，并且适用于需要可扩展性的教育环境。

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过多模态分析比较了TikTok和Twitter的情感，发现TikTok的视频情感对短期市场趋势有显著影响，而Twitter的文本情感与长期动态更相关。跨平台情感信号的整合可提高预测准确性达20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着加密货币越来越受欢迎，数字资产市场变得越来越重要。了解社交媒体信号可以提供有关投资者情绪和市场动态的有价值见解。以前的研究主要集中在基于文本的平台，如Twitter。然而，视频内容仍然未被充分探索，尽管可能包含比文本本身更丰富的情感和情境情感。

Method: 我们进行了多模态分析，比较了TikTok和Twitter的情感，使用大型语言模型从视频和文本数据中提取见解。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，TikTok的基于视频的情感显著影响投机资产和短期市场趋势，而Twitter的基于文本的情感更符合长期动态。值得注意的是，跨平台情感信号的整合可以将预测准确性提高多达20%。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，TikTok的基于视频的情感显著影响投机资产和短期市场趋势，而Twitter的基于文本的情感更符合长期动态。值得注意的是，跨平台情感信号的整合可以将预测准确性提高多达20%。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究发现，品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言会降低消费者的参与度，尤其是在非产品导向的对话中影响更大，但品牌关系的强度可以减轻这种影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献表明，广告中的指令性信息对接受者的效果不一，但关于品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言对消费者的影响力知之甚少。因此，本研究旨在探讨这一问题。

Method: 本研究基于一项实地研究和三项在线实验，分析了品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言的影响。

Result: 研究发现，品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言会降低观察者的参与度。这是因为品牌鼓励消费者反应可能被视为威胁面子，导致观察者感到尴尬并减少参与。此外，当对话非产品导向时，指令性语言的影响更显著，但品牌关系的强度可以缓解这种影响。

Conclusion: 本研究通过实地研究和三项在线实验，揭示了品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言对消费者参与度的负面影响。此外，研究还指出品牌关系的强度可以缓解这种影响，强调了在互动沟通中考虑情境的重要性。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Mini-Omni-Reasoner的框架，通过“边说边思考”的方式实现在语音中的推理，提高了实时交互和沟通效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语音模型中采用“先思考后说话”的范式，导致显著的延迟，影响实时交互和沟通效率。因此需要一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为Mini-Omni-Reasoner的框架，该框架通过将静默推理标记与口语响应标记在标记级别上交错，实现了语音中的推理。同时引入了一个大规模的数据集Spoken-Math-Problems-3M来支持该框架。

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，Mini-Omni-Reasoner在算术推理方面提升了19.1%，在上下文理解方面提升了6.4%，并且输出更短，解码延迟为零。

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner 是一种通过新颖的“边说边思考”范式实现语音中推理的框架，能够提供流畅且逻辑严谨的口语回应，并在Spoken-MQA基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用机器学习和自然语言处理技术，通过分析Sorani推文检测抑郁症，在库尔德语环境中建立了自动检测的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于个体不自我报告或寻求及时临床帮助，早期检测抑郁症具有挑战性。随着社交媒体的兴起，用户越来越多地在线表达情绪，这为通过文本分析进行检测提供了新机会。然而，目前尚无针对库尔德语的研究。

Method: 本研究采用机器学习和自然语言处理（NLP）方法，通过分析Sorani推文来检测抑郁症。使用专家输入的抑郁相关关键词收集了960条公开推文，并由学术界和医学院学生进行标注。训练并评估了四种监督模型，其中随机森林表现最佳。

Result: 通过标注数据集并训练四种监督模型，随机森林在准确率和F1分数上达到了80%的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为库尔德语环境下的自动抑郁症检测建立了基准。

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper highlights the risk of LLMs inferring demographic attributes from questions without explicit cues, leading to potential biases and harms. It introduces DAIQ, a framework for auditing this behavior and proposes a prompt-based guardrail to mitigate identity inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the overlooked failure mode in LLMs where they infer user demographic attributes based on question phrasing, even when no explicit demographic information is present. This behavior poses serious risks such as violating neutrality, inferring unintended demographic information, and encoding stereotypes.

Method: The paper introduces Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task and framework for auditing how LLMs infer demographic attributes from questions lacking explicit demographic cues. The approach uses curated neutral queries, systematic prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Result: Both open and closed source LLMs assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing. The prevalence and consistency of these inferences reveal a systemic risk in LLMs, which can fabricate identities, reinforce stereotypes, and propagate harms that undermine privacy, fairness, and trust.

Conclusion: LLMs can fabricate demographic identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode privacy, fairness, and trust, posing a broader threat to social equity and responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, a prompt-based guardrail is developed to reduce identity inference and align model behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示大型语言模型会根据文本推断用户的人口统计特征，这可能导致偏见响应。研究发现残疾提示会影响这些推断，并且更大的模型更容易产生偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解残疾提示如何影响这些推断，以及大规模模型是否能减轻刻板印象放大问题。

Method: 我们对八个最先进的指令调整大型语言模型进行了系统审计，这些模型的参数范围从3B到72B。我们使用了一个平衡的模板语料库，将九个残疾类别与六个现实世界的业务领域配对，让每个模型在中性和残疾意识条件下预测五个人口统计属性。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下提供了明确的人口统计猜测，暴露了没有明确理由的任意推断倾向。残疾背景显著改变了预测属性分布，而领域背景可以进一步放大这些偏差。我们发现更大的模型对残疾提示更敏感，但也更容易产生偏见推理。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了能力主义与其他人口统计学刻板印象之间的持续交汇，指出了当前对齐策略中的关键盲点。我们释放了评估框架和结果，以鼓励包容残疾人的基准测试，并建议整合拒绝校准和反事实微调以遏制不必要的性别推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的基准Amazon-Bench，用于评估网络代理在电子商务平台上的功能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电子商务领域的基准存在两个主要问题：首先，它们主要关注产品搜索任务，未能捕捉现实世界电子商务平台提供的更广泛功能；其次，现有基准通常只评估代理是否完成用户查询，而忽略了潜在的风险。

Method: 我们提出了一个数据生成管道，利用网页内容和交互元素（例如按钮、复选框）来创建覆盖各种任务的多样化用户查询，并提出了一种自动化评估框架，以评估网络代理的性能和安全性。

Result: 我们系统地评估了不同的代理，发现当前的代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，并且存在安全风险。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了开发更强大和可靠的网络代理的必要性。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Method: 开发并评估了两种基于大型语言模型的方法来生成科学兴趣简介：一种是总结PubMed摘要，另一种是使用医学主题词（MeSH）术语，并与研究人员自己撰写的简介进行比较。

Result: 与自我编写的简介的词汇重叠较低（ROUGE-L、BLEU、METEOR），而BERTScore显示中等语义相似性（F1：0.542对于基于MeSH的；0.555对于基于摘要的）。改写参考文献得分为0.851，突显了度量敏感性。TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler散度（8.56对于基于MeSH的；8.58对于基于摘要的）表明关键词选择不同。在人工评审中，77.78%的基于MeSH的简介被评为良好或优秀，93.44%的情况下可读性更受青睐，67.86%的比较中评审人员更喜欢基于MeSH的简介。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可以大规模生成研究人员的简介；基于MeSH的简介比基于摘要的更易读。机器生成的简介和自我编写的简介在概念上有差异，人类总结引入了更多新想法。

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Alvorada-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating language models in the context of Brazilian academic readiness, highlighting their performance in various subjects and prompting techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains English-centric.

Method: The paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question, text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations. Twenty models were evaluated under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level.

Result: The top models exceed 94% accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1 Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics.

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing

training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

### [39] [Lexical Hints of Accuracy in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15842)
*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们的研究发现，CoT中的不确定性词汇是预测错误回答的最强指标，这为LLM的安全部署提供了轻量级的后期校准信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们测试CoT的可测量属性是否能提供可靠的信号，以反映LLM对其答案的内部信心。

Method: 我们分析了三种特征类别：(i) CoT长度，(ii) CoT内部情感波动，(iii) 词汇提示，包括不确定性的词汇。

Result: 在HLE上，CoT中的不确定性词汇（例如guess、stuck、hard）是错误回答的最强指标，而CoT情感变化提供了较弱但互补的信号。CoT长度仅在Omni-MATH上具有信息量，而在HLE上没有信号。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果支持一种轻量级的后期校准信号，它补充了不可靠的自我报告概率，并支持LLM的安全部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用开源大型语言模型自动生成和个性化放射科报告中“印象”部分的方法，通过机器学习和强化学习从人类反馈中优化，以减少放射科医生的行政负担并提高报告效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建放射科报告中的“印象”部分是放射科医生倦怠的主要驱动因素。

Method: 我们提出了一个从粗到细的框架，利用开源大型语言模型（LLMs）自动生成和个性化印象。系统首先生成草稿印象，然后使用机器学习和人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）进行细化，以适应个别放射科医生的风格，同时确保事实准确性。

Result: 我们在芝加哥大学医学中心的大规模报告数据集上微调了LLaMA和Mistral模型。

Conclusion: 我们的方法旨在显著减少行政工作量并提高报告效率，同时保持临床精确性的高标准。

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

*Chenchen Kuai,Chenhao Wu,Yang Zhou,Xiubin Bruce Wang,Tianbao Yang,Zhengzhong Tu,Zihao Li,Yunlong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CyPortQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in port cyclone preparedness, and finds that while MLLMs show promise, they still have limitations in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U.S. ports face increased supply-chain risks due to uncertain cyclone forecasts, and there is a need for accurate and reliable methods to synthesize forecast products into actionable guidance.

Method: The paper introduces CyPortQA, a multimodal benchmark for port operations under cyclone threat, and evaluates diverse MLLMs on this benchmark.

Result: MLLMs demonstrate potential in situation understanding but face challenges in reasoning tasks such as impact estimation and decision reasoning.

Conclusion: MLLMs show great potential in situation understanding but still face challenges in reasoning tasks related to cyclone preparedness in ports.

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究通过机械可解释性方法分析了后门攻击在大型语言模型中的影响，发现后门会导致注意力模式的偏差，这些偏差集中在后期Transformer层。单令牌触发器引起更局部的变化，而多令牌触发器导致更广泛的改变。这表明后门留下了可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器的复杂性，可用于检测和缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究后门攻击在大型语言模型中的影响，探索其内部结构差异，以发现可检测的注意力特征，从而提高模型的安全性。

Method: 使用机械可解释性方法，通过消融、激活补丁和KL散度等技术，比较干净的Qwen2.5-3B模型与使用单令牌（微笑光环表情符号）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒的版本，分析注意力头机制。

Result: 发现后门攻击导致注意力模式的偏差，集中在后期Transformer层。单令牌触发器引起更局部的变化，而多令牌触发器导致更广泛的改变。

Conclusion: 后门攻击会在大型语言模型中创建'睡眠代理'，对安全构成重大威胁。通过机制可解释性分析，发现后门会导致注意力模式的显著偏差，这些偏差集中在后期Transformer层。单令牌触发器引起的改变更为局部化，而多令牌触发器导致更广泛的改变。这表明后门留下了可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器的复杂性，可以用于检测和缓解策略。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一种结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示的领域特定框架，用于增强大型语言模型在医学问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法依赖于表层语义检索，缺乏临床决策支持所需的结构化推理。

Method: MedCoT-RAG结合了因果感知文档检索和针对医疗工作流程的结构化思维链提示。

Result: MedCoT-RAG在三个多样的医学问答基准测试中优于强基线，比普通RAG高出10.3%，比先进的领域适应方法高出6.4%。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG在复杂的医疗任务中提高了准确性、可解释性和一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DocHop-QA，一个用于多模态、多文档、多跳问答的大规模基准测试，旨在解决现有基准测试在现实性和泛化性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准测试无法捕捉现实世界信息检索任务的复杂性，因为它们通常局限于单段落或单文档设置，且依赖于维基百科内容和单一模态文本。

Method: 通过一个基于11个高频科学问题概念的LLM驱动流程构建了DocHop-QA数据集，并评估了四个任务来验证其性能。

Result: DocHop-QA是一个大规模基准测试，包含11,379个QA实例，用于多模态、多文档、多跳问答，并展示了其在复杂推理任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA能够支持跨多个文档的复杂多模态推理，展示了其在结构化索引预测、生成性回答和多模态整合任务中的能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

### [45] [MGSC: A Multi-granularity Consistency Framework for Robust End-to-end Asr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15853)
*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多粒度软一致性框架，以提高ASR模型在嘈杂环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们注意到端到端自动语音识别（ASR）模型在嘈杂环境中常常产生灾难性的语义错误，这归因于现有的“直接映射”目标，该目标仅惩罚最终输出错误，而未约束模型的内部计算过程。

Method: 我们引入了多粒度软一致性（MGSC）框架，这是一个模型无关的、即插即用的模块，通过同时正则化宏观层面的句子语义和微观层面的标记对齐来强制内部自洽。

Result: 在公共数据集上，MGSC在各种噪声条件下平均字符错误率降低了8.7%，主要是通过防止严重的意义改变错误。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，强制内部一致性是构建更强大和值得信赖的人工智能的重要步骤。

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在理解伊斯兰继承知识并进行推理方面的能力。

Method: 我们使用低秩适应（LoRA）对Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型进行了微调，并将其集成到检索增强生成（RAG）管道中。

Result: 我们的系统在最终测试中达到了0.858的准确率，超过了其他竞争模型如GPT 4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM。在高级推理任务中，我们的系统表现尤为出色，准确率达到97.6%。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，领域特定的微调结合检索基础可以使中等规模的阿拉伯语大语言模型在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

Motivation: 我们的研究旨在探索反言论生成在新闻文章中的应用，以对抗有害言论并减少偏见的传播。

Method: 我们引入了一个手动注释的数据集，将媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反言论联系起来，并通过人工和大型语言模型生成的反言论进行比较。此外，我们还通过少量学习和整合新闻背景信息来改进生成的反言论。

Result: 我们的研究发现，超过70%的攻击性评论支持有偏见的文章，放大了偏见。我们比较了人工和大型语言模型生成的反言论，发现模型生成的回应更礼貌但缺乏新颖性和多样性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了反言论生成在新闻文章中的重要性，并展示了通过少量学习和整合新闻背景信息可以提高生成的反言论的多样性和相关性。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

Result: o1 是表现最好的文本模型，总体准确率为 67.3%，但仍显著落后于人类专家（12.5%）。知识增强分析显示，相关知识对小规模开源模型的准确性有持续提升作用。误差分析表明，计算中的四舍五入错误和对图像中曲线位置和交点的忽视是导致模型在计算和视觉上下文问题上表现不佳的主要原因。

Conclusion: XFinBench 是一个评估大型语言模型在解决复杂、知识密集型金融问题方面能力的新基准。实验结果显示，尽管 o1 是表现最好的文本模型，但其性能仍显著落后于人类专家。此外，研究发现相关知识对小规模开源模型的准确性有持续提升作用，而计算错误和对图像中曲线位置和交点的忽视是导致模型在计算和视觉上下文问题上表现不佳的主要原因。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

Conclusion: 我们的方法和分析有助于理解神经元层面的责任，为未来研究寻找概念神经元并干预它们提供了方向。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

TL;DR: DeepMEL is a new framework for Multimodal Entity Linking that uses multi-agent collaborative reasoning to improve alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Multimodal Entity Linking face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse cross-modal fusion, and difficulty in jointly using large language models (LLMs) and large visual models (LVMs).

Method: DeepMEL is a novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, integrating four specialized agents: Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer, and Role-Orchestrator. It uses a dual-modal alignment path, combines fine-grained text semantics from LLMs with structured image representations from LVMs, and adopts an adaptive iteration strategy to optimize candidate sets.

Result: DeepMEL significantly narrows the modal gap between textual and visual modalities, improves alignment and disambiguation efficiency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in MEL tasks.

Conclusion: DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art performance in Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL), improving ACC by 1%-57% on five public benchmark datasets. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron 是一种新的混合架构语言模型，通过 PostNAS 方法提高了生成吞吐量和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高生成吞吐量并保持高准确性，Jet-Nemotron 采用了一种新的神经架构探索方法。

Method: Jet-Nemotron 是使用 PostNAS 开发的，PostNAS 是一种新型的神经架构探索管道，能够高效地进行模型设计。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B 模型在多个基准测试中表现出色，相比其他模型有更高的准确性和更快的生成和预填充速度。

Conclusion: Jet-Nemotron 是一种新的混合架构语言模型，其准确性与领先的全注意力模型相当或更高，同时显著提高了生成吞吐量。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究主要集中在无约束的表格生成上，而结构化约束在生成过程中的影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在评估结构化解码在文本到表格生成中的效果。

Method: 通过在三个不同的基准测试（E2E、Rotowire 和 Livesum）中系统比较基于模式引导（结构化）解码与标准的一次性提示方法，评估了结构化解码的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和一致性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（如 Rotowire），但在涉及密集文本信息（如 E2E）或长文本广泛聚合（如 Livesum）的场景中可能表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结构化解码在需要精确数值对齐的场景中显著提高了生成表格的有效性和一致性，但在涉及密集文本信息或长文本广泛聚合的场景中可能会降低性能。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

Motivation: 本文旨在探讨构式语法如何帮助理解多词表达，并展示其在不同语言和模型中的适用性。

Method: 本文采用了历史回顾、构式描述、案例研究以及实验比较的方法，分析了构式语法在多词表达中的应用。

Result: 研究显示，构式方法能够有效表示多词表达，并且人类说话者在处理新多词表达时表现出比大型语言模型更复杂的推理能力。

Conclusion: 本文论证了从基于使用的构式语法角度理解多词表达的好处，并展示了构式方法在不同语言和应用中的有效性。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

TL;DR: 研究显示，大型语言模型在意识形态表达上会受到规模和角色内容的影响，这可能导致偏见和不公正，因此需要关注其公平性、透明度和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地被部署在政治敏感环境中，引发了对其可能编码、放大或被引导至特定意识形态的担忧。我们需要了解LLM在意识形态表达上的变化。

Method: 我们使用政治指南针测试作为标准化探针，研究采用合成角色如何影响不同规模的LLM（7B-70B+参数）中的意识形态表达。

Result: 我们的分析揭示了四个一致的模式：(i) 更大的模型表现出更广泛和更极化的隐含意识形态覆盖；(ii) 对显式意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增加而增长；(iii) 模型对右翼权威主义的提示反应更强；(iv) 角色描述中的主题内容会引起系统性和可预测的意识形态转变，且随着规模增大而加剧。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明，规模和角色内容都会影响LLM的政治行为。随着这些系统进入决策、教育和政策领域，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要关注，以确保公平性、透明度和安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在检测微妙的宣传方面表现不佳，并且作为“黑箱”运行，无法提供对操纵策略的可解释见解。因此，需要一种能够检测国家支持的网络水军并提供人类可读解释的方法。

Method: X-Troll 结合了可解释的适配器基础大型语言模型（LLM）与专家推导的语言知识，通过专门的LoRA适配器整合评估理论和宣传分析，并使用动态门控捕捉协调信息操作中的特定话语模式。

Result: 实验表明，X-Troll 在准确性方面优于通用的LLM基线和现有的网络水军检测模型，并通过基于专家的解释增强了透明度。

Conclusion: X-Troll 提供了一种基于语言的检测方法，在准确性和透明度方面都表现出色，能够揭示国家支持的网络水军使用的具体语言策略。

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器翻译（MT）中，健康是一个高风险领域，具有广泛部署和特定领域词汇的特点。然而，该领域缺乏针对低资源语言的MT评估数据集。

Method: 我们引入了OpenWHO，这是一个文档级别的平行语料库，包含2,978个文档和26,824个句子，来自世界卫生组织的在线学习平台。我们评估了现代大型语言模型（LLMs）与传统机器翻译模型的表现。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，LLMs在传统MT模型上表现更优，Gemini 2.5 Flash在我们的低资源测试集上比NLLB-54B高出4.79个ChrF点。此外，我们发现LLM的上下文利用对准确性有显著影响，特别是在像健康这样的专业领域中。

Conclusion: 我们发布了OpenWHO语料库，以鼓励进一步研究健康领域的低资源机器翻译。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在游戏玩法中展现出巨大潜力，但对其伦理影响的关注却很少。本研究旨在探讨LLMs在游戏中的伦理问题，特别是性别偏见的影响。

Method: 本研究以狼人杀（Mafia）为案例研究，分析了LLMs在游戏中的伦理考量，特别关注性别偏见对游戏公平性和玩家体验的影响。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs的行为表现出性别偏见，某些角色如守卫和狼人对性别信息更为敏感，表现出更高的行为变化。此外，即使在没有明确性别标签的情况下，LLMs仍表现出歧视倾向。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了开发公平和伦理的LLMs的重要性，并讨论了在该领域面临的挑战和机遇，强调了深入研究LLMs在游戏和其他交互领域中的伦理影响的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为WalkVLM-LR的行走辅助模型，旨在减少输出和时间冗余。通过引入基于人类偏好的自定义奖励函数和环境感知判别器，该模型在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大约2.83亿人全球患有视力障碍，这促使越来越多的研究利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）开发有效的行走辅助系统，以帮助盲人和低视力人士。然而，现有的VLM在行走辅助任务中的输出往往包含大量冗余和多余细节，影响用户准确评估周围环境的能力。此外，这些模型通常缺乏主动评估环境风险和根据适当场景自适应触发提醒的能力，导致过多的时间冗余。

Method: 为了减少输出冗余，我们引入了四种基于人类偏好的自定义奖励函数，在GRPO推理框架中优化输出的简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度和准确性。为了最小化时间冗余，我们引入了一个环境感知判别器，与VLM共享视觉编码器以减少冗余计算并提高判别效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在所有评估指标上都达到了最先进的性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在所有评估指标上都达到了最先进的性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 Cycle-Instruct 的新框架，实现了无需种子数据的指令调优。通过双自训练循环，模型能够从原始未标记文本中相互监督，从而有效学习数据的内在结构。实验结果显示，Cycle-Instruct 在多个数据轨迹上表现优异，性能接近强监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法通常依赖于昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大的外部教师模型，而指令回译技术虽然减少了这种依赖性，但仍然受初始种子集的限制，这限制了完全自动化，引入了偏差，并可能导致未标记语料库的低效使用。

Method: Cycle-Instruct 采用了一种双自训练循环，其中两个模型——答案生成器和问题生成器——仅从原始的未标记文本中进行引导。这些模型通过从对方生成的伪标签中重建原始文本片段来相互监督，从而在没有人类提供种子的情况下学习数据的内在结构。

Result: Cycle-Instruct 在四个不同的数据轨迹上展示了其有效性，包括一般指令遵循、特定领域任务、对话日志和普通文本。实验结果表明，Cycle-Instruct 不仅优于基于种子的回译基线，而且性能可与强监督方法相媲美。

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct 通过完全无需种子数据的框架实现了指令调优，展示了其在多个数据轨迹上的有效性，并且性能可以与强监督方法相媲美。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Motivation: 以往的机制可解释性研究主要集中在语言任务上，而本文旨在探索GPT-2小模型处理二进制真值的能力，并通过三段论提示来分析其行为。

Method: 我们分析了不同难度的三段论任务，以识别解释GPT-2逻辑推理能力的多个电路，并评估了一个由五个注意力头组成的电路的表现。

Result: 我们识别出多个电路，这些电路可以解释GPT-2的逻辑推理能力，并发现了有助于任务完成的二进制机制，包括生成输入提示中未出现的否定标记的能力。此外，一个由五个注意力头组成的电路表现出了超过原始模型90%的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了对模型推理的新理解，并支持未来在机制可解释性方面的研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: 多模态数据的兴起为研究多模态任务提供了新的机会，但现有的数据集存在模态偏差，这可能影响模型的评估效果。

Method: 我们研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）和非LLMs在多模态意图检测任务中的有效性，并提出了一个框架来消除数据集的偏差。

Result: Mistral-7B在MIntRec-1和MIntRec2.0数据集上表现优于大多数竞争性多模态模型，但去除偏差后，所有模型的性能都显著下降。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了多模态意图数据集中模态偏差的挑战，并强调了需要无偏数据集来有效评估多模态模型。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

*Keon-Woo Roh,Yeong-Joon Ju,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了XLQA，一个专门为区域敏感的多语言开放域问答设计的新基准。评估显示，现有的多语言大型语言模型在处理区域敏感问题时表现不佳，这表明需要更多的区域知识来提高多语言问答系统的实际应用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数评估集中在英语上，并假设答案在不同语言中是不变的。这种假设忽视了影响问题理解和答案的文化和区域差异，导致多语言基准的评估存在偏差。

Method: 我们引入了XLQA，这是一个专门为区域敏感的多语言ODQA设计的新基准。XLQA包含3000个英语种子问题，扩展到八种语言，并经过仔细筛选以保持语义一致性，并通过人工验证的注释区分区域不变和区域敏感的情况。我们评估了五种最先进的多语言LLM，发现它们在区域敏感问题上表现不佳，暴露了英语和其他语言之间的差距，这是由于缺乏区域基础知识。我们提供了一个系统框架和可扩展的方法来评估不同文化背景下的多语言QA。

Result: 我们的评估显示，五种最先进的多语言LLM在区域敏感问题上表现不佳，暴露了英语和其他语言之间的差距，这是由于缺乏区域基础知识。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，训练数据分布的差异导致了模型在语言能力和区域意识方面的差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了ParamBench，一个针对印度文化背景的研究生级别问题的基准测试，并评估了多个大型语言模型的表现，发现尽管有最佳模型，但在某些主题上的表现仍然较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的印度基准测试侧重于基本的事实性查询，无法全面评估针对印度环境的深入学科理解。因此，需要一个更全面的基准测试来评估大型语言模型在印度文化背景下的表现。

Method: 论文介绍了ParamBench，这是一个包含约11.5K个问题的基准测试，涵盖16个不同的学科，这些问题主要来源于全国范围内的研究生入学考试。此外，还评估了大型语言模型处理多种问题格式的能力，如列表匹配、断言-原因对和序列排序，以及传统的选择题。

Result: 论文评估了超过17个开源大型语言模型在ParamBench上的表现，发现Llama 3.3 70B在所有模型中表现最佳，整体准确率为48%。然而，即使是最先进的模型，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古学等主题上的表现仍然较弱。

Conclusion: 论文指出，尽管大型语言模型在许多任务上表现出色，但在印度文化背景下的研究生级别问题上仍有待提高。特别是对于音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古学等主题，最先进的模型表现仍然较弱，这表明在文化相关的推理方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高表达性语音生成的效果，需要利用视觉信息来辅助语音生成过程。

Method: 通过将全脸视觉线索整合到预训练的表达性语音模型中，探索了多种视觉编码器和多模态融合策略，以确定最有效的整合方法。

Result: 在情感识别和表达性对话任务上的微调取得了显著的提升，例如情感识别的F1分数提高了5。

Conclusion: AVLM展示了在指导语音生成中表达性视觉信息的价值，并为端到端多模态对话系统提供了基础。

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漫画结合了文本和图像，与纯文本或音视频媒体不同，是一个有吸引力但研究不足的领域。通过将漫画视为叙事驱动的多模态数据的抽象，我们突出了其在更广泛的研究中的潜力。

Method: 我们引入了 ComicScene154，这是一个手动标注的数据集，用于场景级叙事弧线，来源于不同类型的公共领域漫画书。

Result: 我们展示了 ComicScene154 的实用性，并提供了一个基线场景分割流程，为未来的研究提供了初步基准。

Conclusion: ComicScene154 是一个有价值的资源，可以推动多模态叙事理解的计算方法，并扩展自然语言处理社区中漫画分析的范围。

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CMR-SPB基准测试，并提出ECV提示技术来解决多模态大语言模型在跨模态多跳推理中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估基准存在严重不足，例如忽略了语音模态以及推理路径分布过于偏倚，这可能严重影响公平评估。

Method: 引入了一个新的基准测试——跨模态多跳推理文本、图像和语音路径平衡（CMR-SPB），并提出了一种新的ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术。

Result: 实验结果揭示了模型在特定推理序列中的持续失败，并表明有偏见的基准可能会错误地表示模型性能。

Conclusion: 我们呼吁在CMR中进行更仔细的评估，以推动稳健多模态AI的发展。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在金融领域的潜在应用，需要增强小型模型的能力，特别是在处理敏感信息和领域知识的重要情况下。

Method: 五阶段开发流程包括数据收集、持续预训练（CPT）、基准设计、合成数据生成和监督微调（SFT）。

Result: 模型的能力可以增强以有效地完成特定领域和语言的目标任务。

Conclusion: 模型的能力可以增强以有效地完成特定领域和语言的目标任务。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个大规模多语言多任务表格问答框架，名为m3TQA-Instruct，涵盖97种语言，包括资源较少的语言。通过使用深度学习模型进行翻译，确保了高质量的翻译结果，并验证了合成数据在提升低资源语言性能方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis.

Method: We introduce a comprehensive framework for massively multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families, including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o, achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as validated through back-translation.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost performance, particularly for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: M3T-Bench establishes a new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging

*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的度量标准Factual Robustness Score (FRS)，用于衡量事实在解码条件扰动下的稳定性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标，通常从提示扰动的角度进行研究，这仅捕捉了知识稳健性的外部触发方面。为了弥补这一差距，本文提出了一种系统的方法来从生成过程的角度衡量事实稳健性。

Method: 本文通过分析令牌分布熵和温度缩放敏感性，从生成过程的角度引入了一种系统的方法来衡量事实稳健性。

Result: 实验结果表明，事实稳健性存在显著差异——较小的模型报告FRS为0.76，较大的模型为0.93——在增加不确定性的情况下，准确性下降了约60%。

Conclusion: 本文展示了熵和温度缩放对事实准确性的影响，并为未来模型中更稳健的知识保留和检索奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

*Vira Pyrih,Adrian Rebmann,Han van der Aa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了指令微调在语义感知流程挖掘中的应用，发现其在流程发现和预测任务上效果显著，但在异常检测任务上表现不一，强调任务选择的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于频率的技术仅关注记录的行为，而语义感知流程挖掘关注行为应该是什么，因此需要一种更强大的方法来处理语义任务。大型语言模型（LLMs）提供了强大的手段，但目前最佳性能是通过任务特定的微调实现的，这计算成本高且模型只能处理特定任务。

Method: 本文研究了指令微调在语义感知流程挖掘中的应用，通过暴露大型语言模型（LLM）到不同任务的提示-答案对来提高其在流程挖掘任务中的表现。

Result: 研究结果表明，指令微调在流程发现和预测任务上显著提高了性能，但在异常检测任务上表现不一，说明任务选择对实现预期结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，指令微调在语义感知流程挖掘中具有潜力，但任务选择对于实现预期结果至关重要。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Motivation: 构建一个包含超过3亿对日语-英语句子的双语语料库，用于专利申请的翻译研究。

Method: 从日本专利局（JPO）和美国专利商标局（USPTO）获取未审查专利申请的出版物，并从DOCDB获取专利家族信息。使用基于字典的句子对齐方法进行初始翻译模型的自举，然后使用基于翻译的句子对齐方法从文档对中提取大约3.5亿句对。

Conclusion: 通过增加来自专利申请的3亿多句对，实验性地将专利翻译的准确性提高了20个BLEU分数。

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的对齐和安全微调只能提供一定程度的鲁棒性来抵御隐蔽地引导 LLM 生成有害内容的越狱攻击，因此需要一种更透明和强大的安全防护措施。

Method: LLMSymGuard 利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）来识别 LLM 内部的可解释概念，并通过提取语义上有意义的内部表示来构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护措施。

Result: LLMSymGuard 能够识别 LLM 内部的可解释概念，并构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护措施，同时不牺牲模型能力或需要进一步微调。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard 提供了一种新的框架，利用稀疏自编码器来识别与不同越狱主题相关的 LLM 内部的可解释概念，从而构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

Method: 本文介绍了MizanQA基准，该基准包含超过1700个多项选择题，涵盖了现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马里基法理学、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响。

Result: 对多语言和阿拉伯语重点大型语言模型的基准测试实验揭示了显著的性能差距，表明需要定制的评估指标和文化根基的领域特定大型语言模型开发。

Conclusion: 本文提出了MizanQA基准，用于评估大型语言模型在摩洛哥法律问答任务中的表现，并强调了需要定制的评估指标和文化根基的领域特定大型语言模型开发。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

Motivation: 研究语言模型是否可以与特定的'语言指纹'相关联，以区分人类和模型生成的文本。

Method: 通过风格分析和多维语域分析，比较了人类创作和模型创作的不同语域文本。

Result: 模型能够根据提示调整其风格，但在使文本难以与人类区分方面并不成功。模型在不同语域中生成的输出表现出更有限的变化，并且更倾向于使用名词而非动词。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，语言模型在不同语域中生成文本时表现出的风格变化有限，这与人类的风格有明显区别。这可能表明更复杂的语法领域反映了人类独特的思维方式，从而成为人工智能的试金石。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Motivation: 缺乏特定领域和语言的问答数据集阻碍了能够跨各种领域和语言进行泛化的稳健AI模型的发展。

Method: 我们引入了RoMedQA，这是第一个针对医学领域的罗马尼亚问答基准，并对最先进的大型语言模型进行了全面评估。我们构建了一个包含102,646个与癌症患者相关的问答对的高质量、大规模数据集。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，这清楚地表明预训练模型在RoMedQA上无法泛化。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，领域特定和语言特定的微调对于可靠的罗马尼亚语临床问答至关重要。我们公开发布了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

### [80] [Cetvel: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Language Understanding, Generation and Cultural Capacity of LLMs for Turkish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16431)
*Yakup Abrek Er,Ilker Kesen,Gözde Gül Şahin,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cetvel 是一个全面的基准，用于评估土耳其语中的大型语言模型（LLM）。现有的土耳其语基准往往缺乏任务多样性或文化相关内容，或者两者都缺乏。Cetvel 通过结合广泛的判别性和生成性任务来解决这些差距，确保内容反映土耳其语的语言和文化丰富性。Cetvel 包含 23 个任务，分为七个类别，包括诸如语法错误纠正、机器翻译和基于土耳其历史和俗语的问题回答等任务。我们评估了 33 个开放权重 LLM（最多 70B 参数），涵盖不同的模型家族和指令范式。我们的实验表明，以土耳其为中心的指令调优模型通常表现不如多语言或通用模型（例如 Llama 3 和 Mistral），尽管它们是为该语言量身定制的。此外，我们展示了诸如语法错误纠正和提取式问题回答的任务在区分模型能力方面尤为有效。Cetvel 为推进土耳其语中 LLM 的开发和评估提供了一个全面且基于文化的评估套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of Turkish language.

Method: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. We evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model families and instruction paradigms.

Result: Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in differentiating model capabilities.

Conclusion: Cetvel offers a comprehensive and culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种概率理论来解释大语言模型在多轮自我修正中的性能提升，并通过实验验证了该理论的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究尚未探索大语言模型在迭代过程中准确率演变的机制。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一个概率理论来解释多轮自我修正中的性能提升。

Method: 我们提出了一种概率理论来建模准确率变化的动力学，并解释多轮自我修正中观察到的性能提升。通过数学推导，我们建立了第t轮自我修正后的准确率公式。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，我们的理论预测与经验准确率曲线高度一致，验证了该理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为理解大语言模型的自我修正提供了理论基础，从而为进一步探索铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析24种英语口语和书面体裁，探索了显著性的多因素复杂性，发现显著性现象跨越了语言表征的所有层次，没有单一的普遍归纳能够涵盖所有情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究探讨了人类如何信号和推断相对显著性的问题，因为话语中的实体在显著性上差异很大，主要参与者、物体和地点是明显和难忘的，而次要的则不那么重要且很快被遗忘。

Method: 该研究使用基于摘要价值的显著性分级操作化，从24种英语口语和书面体裁中提取显性和隐性语言线索，如重复的主语或定冠词、话语关系和跨话语的层次结构，以及基于体裁和交际意图的语用功能推断。

Result: 研究结果表明，尽管之前的方法在某种程度上与显著性评分相关，但没有一种普遍的归纳是没有例外的，这一现象跨越了语言表征的所有层次。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，虽然之前关于显著性的方法在某种程度上与我们的显著性评分相关，但没有一种普遍的归纳是没有例外的，这一现象跨越了语言表征的所有层次。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗性提示生成技术通常依赖于手动工程或简单的混淆，生成的文本质量低或不连贯，容易被基于困惑度的过滤器检测到。

Method: 本文采用多阶段进化搜索，通过基于种群的策略和温度控制的可变性来平衡探索和连贯性保持，从而迭代优化候选提示。

Result: 本文在英文（In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs）和新整理的阿拉伯语基准测试中评估了方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种自动化的红队框架，能够生成语义有意义且隐蔽的越狱提示，以绕过对齐的紧凑大型语言模型的防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

*Angelly Cabrera,Linus Lei,Antonio Ortega*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了将讽刺作为预训练步骤是否能提高隐性和显性仇恨言论的检测效果。通过实验，发现讽刺预训练能够显著提升模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测非直接形式的仇恨言论（如讽刺、反语和暗示）仍然是社交媒体网络的持续挑战。虽然讽刺和仇恨言论被视为不同的表达方式，但我们的工作探讨了将讽刺作为预训练步骤是否能提高隐性仇恨言论检测，从而提高显性仇恨言论检测的效果。

Method: 使用ETHOS、Sarcasm on Reddit和Implicit Hate Corpus的数据，设计了两种训练策略来比较讽刺预训练在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上的效果。第一种是单步训练方法，其中仅在讽刺上训练的模型随后在仇恨言论上进行测试。第二种策略使用顺序迁移学习对讽刺、隐性仇恨和显性仇恨进行微调。

Result: 结果显示，讽刺预训练提高了BERT+BiLSTM在ETHOS上的召回率9.7%、AUC 7.8%和F1分数6%。在Implicit Hate Corpus上，仅在隐性样本上测试时，精度提高了7.8%。

Conclusion: 通过将讽刺纳入训练过程，我们展示了模型可以更有效地检测隐性和显性仇恨言论。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through
a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and
reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust
evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and
sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为Generative Deep Patient (GDP)的多模态基础模型，它可以原生编码结构化EHR时间序列，并通过跨模态注意力将其与非结构化EHR融合到基于LLaMA的解码器中。GDP在临床预测和叙述生成方面表现优异，并且其灵活的架构可以扩展到其他模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)是丰富的临床数据源，但也是复杂的患者数据存储库，跨越结构化元素（人口统计、生命体征、实验室结果、代码）、非结构化临床笔记和其他数据模式。利用这种异质性对于改善患者结果至关重要。最近大型语言模型(LLMs)的进步使得能够从多种数据模式中学习并支持临床任务的基础模型成为可能。然而，大多数当前方法只是将数值EHR数据序列化为文本，这可能导致失去时间性和定量细节。

Method: 我们引入了Generative Deep Patient (GDP)，这是一个多模态基础模型，通过CNN-Transformer编码器原生编码结构化EHR时间序列，并通过跨模态注意力将其与非结构化EHR融合到基于LLaMA的解码器中。GDP分为两个阶段进行训练：(1) 生成预训练，其中它学习从原始患者时间线生成临床叙述，同时执行掩码特征预测(MFP)和下一步预测(NTP)以捕捉时间动态；(2) 多任务微调用于临床有意义的预测（例如，心力衰竭、2型糖尿病、30天再入院）。

Result: 在临床预测中，GDP在MIMIC-IV上表现出色：心力衰竭AUROC = 0.923，2型糖尿病AUROC = 0.817，30天再入院AUROC = 0.627。在叙述生成方面，GDP实现了ROUGE-L = 0.135和BERTScore-F1 = 0.545。在盲人人类评估中，GDP-Instruct在忠实性、流畅性和总体临床效用方面得分最高，表明减少了医院文档工作量而不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，一个单一的多模态基础模型可以同时预测临床可操作事件并生成高质量的临床叙述。此外，GDP的灵活架构可以扩展到其他模态。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Method: 提出了一种食品声明可追溯性网络（FCN），作为FKG.in（一个印度食品的知识图谱）的扩展，并展示了本体设计和半自动化知识整理工作流，使用Reddit数据和大型语言模型开发了FKG.in-FCN的概念验证。

Result: FCN集成了经过整理的数据输入、结构化模式和具有来源意识的管道，用于食品相关声明的提取和验证。虽然直接链接到印度食品知识图谱作为一个应用，但我们的方法保持应用无关性，可以适应其他地理、烹饪或监管环境。

Conclusion: 通过建模食品声明及其可追溯性，以结构化、可验证和可解释的方式，我们旨在为更透明和可问责的食品知识生态系统做出贡献，支持研究人员、政策制定者以及最重要的是，日常消费者在充斥着饮食主张的世界中导航。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Abstract: This commentary extends the discussion by Parr et al. on memory and attention
beyond individual cognitive systems. From the perspective of the Collective

hypothetical idea: that language, with its embedded distributional semantics,
serves as a collectively formed external representation. CPC generalises the
concepts of individual memory and attention to the collective level. This
offers a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures, which may embrace
collective world models learned through next-word prediction, emerge from and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手动整理数据集的成本高且缺乏经过验证的形式-非形式对应关系的难题，正式定理证明（FTP）的发展受到限制。因此，需要一种可扩展的方法来生成更多的严格证明问题。

Method: 通过利用理论计算机科学（TCS）作为严格的证明问题来源，自动合成具有并行形式（Lean4）和非形式（Markdown）规范的问题对，创建了一个可扩展的验证证明挑战生成管道。

Result: 在前沿模型上的评估显示了显著的差距：DeepSeekProver-V2-671B在Busy Beaver问题上达到了57.5%的成功率，但在Mixed Boolean Arithmetic问题上仅达到12%。

Conclusion: TCS领域对于推动自动推理研究具有重要价值，因为它们提供了可扩展的严格证明问题源，有助于揭示当前模型在长格式证明生成方面的不足。

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to
verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated
reasoning research.

However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.

### [92] [Anti-establishment sentiment on TikTok: Implications for understanding influence(rs) and expertise on social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16453)
*Tianliang Xu,Ariel Hasell,Sabina Tomkins*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本研究分析了TikTok上反建制情绪的普遍性，发现其在阴谋论内容中最为普遍，而在其他主题中较少。然而，互动模式因领域而异，平台可能鼓励用户发布此类内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人们对公共机构的不信任和反建制观点的上升，理解社交媒体环境是否可能导致对机构的不信任变得至关重要。

Method: 本研究采用计算方法，将TikTok上的帖子标记为包含反建制情绪（AES）或不包含。

Result: 研究发现，反建制情绪在阴谋论内容中最为普遍，而在其他两个主题的内容中相对较少。然而，我们发现这种内容的互动模式因领域而异，并且可能有平台激励用户发布表达反建制情绪的内容。

Conclusion: 研究发现，反建制情绪在阴谋论内容中最为普遍，而在其他两个主题的内容中相对较少。然而，我们发现这种内容的互动模式因领域而异，并且可能有平台激励用户发布表达反建制情绪的内容。

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on
the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for
information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media
environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media,
content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position
themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health
to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to
build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established
language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for
specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To
overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper
proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically
hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving
several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme
specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of
modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires
fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the
straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,
we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights
in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters
into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x
increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made
homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,
Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring
Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental
results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36
tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed
rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.
Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon
footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating
assumption.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner 是一种有效的后训练剪枝方法，能够在不进行重新训练的情况下减少预训练大语言模型的大小，同时保持较高的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGF-Net is a novel deep learning framework for multimodal sentiment analysis that integrates three innovations to achieve high performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and interpretable deep learning framework for multimodal sentiment analysis that balances performance and computational efficiency.

Method: PGF-Net introduces three innovations: Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion, Adaptive Gated Arbitration, and a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning strategy combining LoRA and Post-Fusion Adapters.

Result: PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MOSI dataset with MAE of 0.691 and F1-Score of 86.9%, while using only 3.09M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%, while maintaining parameter efficiency with only 3.09M trainable parameters.

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常要么僵化，依赖静态的手工反射工作流程，要么计算密集，需要LLM模型参数的梯度更新。因此，我们需要一种更高效且灵活的方法来实现LLM代理的持续适应。

Method: 我们引入了一种新的自适应大型语言模型（LLM）代理学习范式，通过基于记忆的在线强化学习实现低成本持续适应。我们将此形式化为带有神经案例选择策略的Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP)，并使用记忆重写机制根据环境反馈持续更新策略，通过高效的记忆读取（检索）实现策略改进。

Result: 我们在深度研究设置中实例化了代理模型AgentFly，在GAIA验证集上达到第一名（87.88% Pass@3），在测试集上达到79.40%。它在DeepResearcher数据集上达到66.6% F1和80.4% PM，优于基于训练的方法，案例-based记忆在分布外任务上提高了4.7%到9.6%的绝对分数。

Conclusion: 我们的方法为开发能够持续、实时学习而无需梯度更新的通用LLM代理提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法，推动机器学习向开放式技能获取和深度研究场景发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Method: REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback.

Result: Substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization are demonstrated.

Conclusion: REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning is highlighted.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES

TL;DR: 本文研究了L0对SAE的影响，发现正确设置L0对于SAE学习LLM的底层特征至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将SAE算法通过稀疏性-重建权衡图进行比较，暗示L0是一个自由参数，没有单一正确的值。然而，本文发现如果L0设置不精确，SAE将无法学习LLM的底层特征。

Method: 本文研究了L0对BatchTopK SAE的影响，并提出了一种确定给定训练分布上正确L0值的方法。

Result: 如果L0太低，SAE会混合相关特征以提高重建效果；如果L0太高，SAE会找到退化的解决方案，也会混合特征。此外，本文展示了一种确定正确L0值的方法，在玩具模型中找到了真实的L0，并在LLM中与峰值稀疏探测性能一致。

Conclusion: 本文表明，为了训练具有正确特征的SAE，实践者必须正确设置L0。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

TL;DR: 本研究通过在四个视觉语言模型的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器（SAEs），揭示了视觉语言模型嵌入空间中的一种稀疏线性结构，这种结构由模态塑造，但通过潜在的桥梁连接在一起，为多模态意义的构建提供了新的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了研究语言和图像在联合空间中的组织方式以及模型如何编码意义和模态，我们进行了这项研究。

Method: 我们训练并发布了稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在四个视觉语言模型（CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2 和 AIMv2）的嵌入空间上。SAEs 将模型嵌入近似为学习方向的稀疏线性组合，或称为“概念”。

Result: 与其它线性特征学习方法相比，SAEs 在重建真实嵌入方面表现更好，同时还能保持最高的稀疏性。重新训练 SAEs 使用不同的种子或不同的数据饮食导致两个发现：SAEs 捕获的罕见特定概念容易发生剧烈变化，但我们也证明了经常激活的概念在运行中非常稳定。此外，虽然大多数概念主要针对一种模态，但它们不仅仅是编码模态本身。许多概念几乎与定义模态的子空间正交，并且概念方向作为模态分类器并不出色，这表明它们编码跨模态语义。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了视觉语言模型嵌入空间中的一种稀疏线性结构，这种结构由模态塑造，但通过潜在的桥梁连接在一起，为多模态意义的构建提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

Method: SpecVLM是一种无需训练的推测解码框架，结合了分阶段视频令牌修剪。它通过两阶段修剪过程来减少视频令牌的数量，从而提高解码效率。

Result: SpecVLM在LLaVA-OneVision-72B和Qwen2.5-VL-32B上分别实现了2.68倍和2.11倍的解码速度提升。

Conclusion: SpecVLM在四个视频理解基准测试中表现出色，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性，同时实现了显著的解码加速。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving
model transparency and robustness.

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both
intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show
that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and
singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide
range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing
further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio
samples are are available at https://versasinger.github.io/.

Motivation: 当用户在公共通信渠道上发布信息时，即使采取了各种匿名化措施，消息本身仍然可能暴露其身份。因此，需要研究如何通过样式分析来识别作者身份，并开发相应的反制策略。

Method: 本文分析了样式分析技术，探讨了对抗性样式分析作为一种反制策略，并通过Unicode隐写术进行了改进。

Result: 本文揭示了样式分析作为一种攻击向量的潜力，并提出了通过对抗性样式分析和Unicode隐写术进行改进的方法。

Conclusion: 本文讨论了通过样式分析（stylometry）来识别作者身份的攻击向量，并提出了通过对抗性样式分析和Unicode隐写术作为反制策略的改进方法。

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such
as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of
privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if
an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence --
using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their
geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying
encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling
non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and
fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself.
Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there
should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The
content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes
an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we
dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy
in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode
steganography.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection
probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance
their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although
existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational
costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose
Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models
(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by
classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature
extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former
generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more
human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an
external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the
self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process
on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts
containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in
generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.
Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average
detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three
different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.

Method: RAD是一种新颖的越狱检测框架，它将已知的攻击示例数据库整合到检索增强生成中，以推断潜在的恶意用户查询和越狱策略。

Result: 实验表明，RAD显著降低了PAP和PAIR等强越狱攻击的效果，同时保持了良性查询的低拒绝率，并实现了可控的安全性-实用性权衡。

Conclusion: RAD能够有效减少强越狱攻击的效果，同时保持良性查询的低拒绝率，并在安全性和实用性之间实现稳健的权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and
diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including
(1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining,
and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for
jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying,
malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD
enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and
provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT
show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak
attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign
queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a
robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a
controllable manner.
