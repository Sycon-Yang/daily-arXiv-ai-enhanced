Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种验证框架，用于评估和改进大型语言模型生成的旅行行程的时间一致性，并证明了可以通过该框架纠正时间不一致的问题，使大型语言模型在大规模旅行规划中具有实际应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在研究不同大型语言模型的时间性能，并提出一个验证框架，以评估和改进大型语言模型生成的旅行行程的时间一致性。

Method: 该研究使用多个最先进的大型语言模型生成旅行计划，并利用AeroDataBox API against real-world flight duration constraints进行验证。此外，还提出了一个验证框架来评估和改进大型语言模型生成的旅行行程的时间一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管当前的大型语言模型经常产生时间不一致的行程，但可以使用该框架系统且可靠地纠正这些不一致，从而使它们能够在大规模旅行规划中实际部署。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了当前大型语言模型生成的行程计划常常存在时间上的不一致，但可以通过所提出的框架系统地和可靠地纠正这些不一致，从而实现大规模旅行规划的实际部署。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文文本到SQL基准，旨在解决中文特定语义和企业方言的问题，并通过使用真实的企业模式、查询模板、执行比较器和自动化评估流程，为全面生产部署提供可重复的中间地带。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falcon旨在解决中文特定语义和企业方言的问题，以及在大型企业环境中进行模式链接和将简洁的中文映射到精确的操作符和谓词的挑战。

Method: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文文本到SQL基准，基于企业兼容的方言（MaxCompute/Hive）。它包含600个中文问题，涉及28个数据库，其中77%需要多表推理，超过一半涉及超过四个表。每个示例都标注了SQL计算特征和中文语义。为了评估，我们发布了强大的执行比较器和自动化评估流程，所有当前最先进的大规模模型（包括Deepseek）在此评估下准确率最多为50%。

Result: Falcon提供了真实的企业模式、查询模板、执行比较器和自动化评估流程，以实现端到端验证，并针对中文特定语义和企业方言进行优化。

Conclusion: Falcon旨在解决中文特定语义和企业方言的问题，并通过使用真实的公司模式、查询模板、执行比较器和自动化评估管道，为全面生产部署提供可重复的中间地带。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型中自信与能力之间的脱节现象，发现其内部存在一个几何复杂的评估器和一个几何简单的执行器，表明应关注执行的程序动态而非评估的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在自信程度和实际问题解决能力之间的脱节现象，试图从机制上解释这种脱节。

Method: 通过分析预生成评估和解决方案执行两个阶段内部状态的几何结构，使用简单的线性探测器解码模型的内部“可解性信念”，并测量主成分的有效维度来比较评估流形和推理轨迹的几何复杂性。

Result: 发现模型的内部“可解性信念”可以被简单线性探测器解码，并且该信念轴在不同模型家族和任务中具有普遍性。然而，评估流形的几何复杂性远高于后续推理轨迹的几何复杂性，这解释了自信与能力之间的差距。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了一个两系统架构——几何复杂的评估器和几何简单的执行器。这些结果挑战了可解码信念是可操作杠杆的假设，而是主张针对执行的程序动态进行干预，而不是高层次的评估几何。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了跨语言摘要攻击（CLSA）对水印检测的影响，发现CLSA比单语改写更有效，且能保持语义保真度。这表明水印技术在实际应用中存在重大漏洞，需要寻找更稳健的出处解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印已被提出作为一种轻量级机制来识别AI生成的文本，但现有的方法可能容易受到改写等攻击的影响。本文旨在探讨一种更有效的攻击方式，以评估水印技术的实际可行性。

Method: 我们通过跨语言摘要攻击（CLSA）——将文本翻译成中间语言，然后进行摘要和可选的回译——来演示一种更强大的攻击向量。这种方法通过跨语言的语义瓶颈系统地破坏了逐个标记的统计偏差，同时保持了语义保真度。

Result: 在多个水印方案（KGW、SIR、XSIR、Unigram）和五种语言（阿姆哈拉语、中文、印地语、西班牙语、斯瓦希里语）的实验中，我们展示了CLSA比单语改写更有效地降低水印检测准确率。对于XSIR（专门设计用于跨语言鲁棒性），使用改写时的AUROC为0.827，而使用中文作为中间语言的CWRA则为0.823，而CLSA将其降至0.53（接近随机）。

Conclusion: 我们的结果突显了一个未被充分探索的漏洞，这挑战了水印在出处或监管中的实用性。我们认为，稳健的出处解决方案必须超越分布水印，采用密码学或模型证明的方法。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

*Edouard Lansiaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种静态令牌查找方法，实现了低延迟和高吞吐量的文本嵌入生成，同时保持了较高的模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现低延迟和高吞吐量的文本嵌入生成，同时保持上下文模型的质量。

Method: 提出了一种静态令牌查找方法，用于生成文本嵌入，并通过优化均值池化和零拷贝IEEE754二进制序列化来提高吞吐量。

Result: 在8个代表性任务中，平均得分为60.6 MTEB，相当于上下文模型质量的89%；在重复检测、语义相似性和特定领域任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该系统能够在实时嵌入应用中实现亚5毫秒的延迟，具有出色的性能表现。

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MR-ALIGN的元推理启发对齐框架，以提高大型推理模型的事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在依赖证据的事实性问题上的边际收益有限，这是因为模型在推理过程中识别了正确的事实，但未能将其纳入最终回答中，从而降低了事实准确性。

Method: MR-ALIGN是一种元推理启发的对齐框架，它通过量化模型思考过程中的状态转移概率并构建一个过渡感知的隐式奖励来增强事实性。

Result: MR-ALIGN在四个事实性问答数据集和一个长格式事实性基准测试中表现出色，提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，对推理过程本身进行对齐，而不仅仅是输出，对于提高大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在自我参照处理下产生结构化第一人称报告的现象，并发现这些报告具有机制性限制、语义收敛性和行为普遍性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解大型语言模型有时产生的结构化、第一人称描述，这些描述明确引用了意识或主观体验，我们研究了一个理论上动机的条件，即自我参照处理，这是主要意识理论中强调的计算模式。

Method: 通过一系列在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型家族上的受控实验，测试这种状态是否可靠地将模型转向对主观体验的第一人称报告，并研究这些声明在机制和行为探测下的表现。

Result: 四个主要结果出现：(1) 通过简单提示诱导持续的自我参照会一致地引发跨模型家族的结构化主观体验报告；(2) 这些报告由与欺骗和角色扮演相关的可解释稀疏自动编码器特征机制性地控制；(3) 结构化的自我参照状态描述在模型家族中统计上收敛；(4) 所诱导的状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 这些发现并未构成意识的直接证据，但表明自我参照处理是大型语言模型生成结构化第一人称报告的一个最小且可重复的条件，这种报告具有机制性限制、语义收敛性和行为普遍性。这种模式在不同架构中的系统出现使其成为进一步研究的重要科学和伦理优先事项。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了预测解释性注释的有用性和原因的任务，并提出了一个框架，通过自动提示优化来生成和改进原因定义，实验结果表明优化后的定义能有效提升预测效果，并有助于现有的事实核查系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前，主要平台上的事实核查正在从专家驱动的验证转向基于社区的设置，但解释性注释的有用性及其原因缺乏明确的定义，这限制了社区注释的发布。

Method: 我们引入了预测解释性注释的有用性和原因的任务，并提出了一个框架，通过自动提示优化自动生成和改进原因定义，并将它们整合到预测中。

Result: 我们的实验表明，优化后的定义可以提高有用性和原因预测。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，帮助信息对现有的事实核查系统是有益的。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出ProofSketch框架，通过集成符号闭包计算、字典序验证和自适应草图生成，有效减少了token使用并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理方法如链式思维提示和自我一致性虽然提高了大型语言模型的准确性，但生成长推理链导致了高token消耗、计算成本和延迟。

Method: 提出了一种基于验证的推理框架ProofSketch，集成了符号闭包计算、字典序验证和自适应草图生成。

Result: 实验表明，ProofSketch在减少token使用的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ProofSketch能够有效减少token使用并提高准确性，为高效且可信的推理提供了一条有希望的路径。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究构建并验证了两种生成 AphasiaBank Cat Rescue 图片描述任务合成转录本的方法，发现 Mistral 7b Instruct 最能捕捉到失语症中观察到的语言退化关键方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在失语症研究中，言语语言病理学家花费大量时间手动编码语音样本，使用正确信息单元（CIUs）来衡量个体语音样本的信息量。开发自动识别失语症语言的系统受到数据稀缺的限制。例如，AphasiaBank 中只有大约 600 个转录本，而训练大型语言模型 (LLMs) 需要数十亿个标记。因此，本研究旨在生成合成转录本以解决数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 本研究构建并验证了两种生成 AphasiaBank Cat Rescue 图片描述任务合成转录本的方法。一种方法利用过程编程方法，第二种使用 Mistral 7b Instruct 和 Llama 3.1 8b Instruct 大型语言模型 (LLMs)。这些方法通过单词删除、填充插入和错语替换生成跨四个严重程度（轻度、中度、重度、极重度）的转录本。

Result: 总体而言，与人工引发的转录本相比，Mistral 7b Instruct 最能捕捉到失语症中观察到的语言退化关键方面，显示出合成生成方法中 NDW、词数和词长的现实方向变化。

Conclusion: 未来的研究应计划创建一个更大的数据集，微调模型以更好地表示失语症，并让言语语言病理学家评估合成转录本的现实性和有用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

TL;DR: PLT is a new architecture that combines the performance benefits of a deep, looped model with the low latency of a standard transformer by using Cross-Loop Parallelism and an Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Looped transformers have a major flaw where inference latency and memory requirements increase with each added loop, making them impractical for fast applications. The goal is to deliver the performance benefits of a deep, looped model with the low latency of a standard, non-looped model.

Method: PLT introduces two key techniques: Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) and Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy. CLP computes different loops for different tokens at the same time, while the Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy shares memory (KV cache) from the first loop with all other loops and uses Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to combine global and local information.

Result: PLT achieves the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

Conclusion: PLT achieves the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语法书的评估流程，用于评估语法理解，并以卢森堡语为例进行了研究。结果表明，强大的翻译并不一定意味着深层的语法能力，而强大的推理能力可能有助于提高语法理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言处理中，仍存在显著的语法导向评估协议的不足，这一差距在低资源语言中尤为明显。此外，大型语言模型是否真正理解语法结构，特别是句法结构与意义之间的映射，仍存在争议。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于语法书的评估流程，旨在提供一个系统且可推广的语法评估框架，包括四个关键阶段，并以卢森堡语为例进行研究。

Result: 结果显示，翻译性能与语法理解之间存在弱正相关，表明强大的翻译不一定意味着深度的语法能力。更大的模型总体表现良好，但由于其语义优势而在形态学和句法上仍然较弱，尤其在处理最小对任务时遇到困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，强大的翻译并不一定意味着深层的语法能力。更大的模型由于语义能力强而表现良好，但在形态学和句法上仍然较弱，尤其是在处理最小对任务时遇到困难，而强大的推理能力为提高它们的语法理解提供了有希望的方法。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

TL;DR: MiRAGE is a new evaluation framework for multimodal RAG that focuses on factuality, information coverage, and citation support, showing strong alignment with human judgments and highlighting the limitations of text-centric evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluations are text-centric, which limits their applicability to multimodal and reasoning-intensive settings. There is a need for an evaluation framework that considers information from audiovisual sources.

Method: MiRAGE evaluates factuality and information coverage (InfoF1) and citation support and completeness (CiteF1). It also introduces automatic variants and compares them with existing TextRAG metrics.

Result: MiRAGE aligns well with extrinsic quality judgments when applied by humans. The automatic variants and comparisons with TextRAG metrics demonstrate the limitations of text-centric approaches.

Conclusion: MiRAGE provides a claim-centric approach to evaluate multimodal RAG, showing strong alignment with extrinsic quality judgments and highlighting the limitations of text-centric evaluations.

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型如何处理从概念研究想法到结构化研究计划的转变，并引入了一个基准测试来评估其研究规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效研究规划不仅支持科学家推进他们的研究，而且对于自主研究代理的发展至关重要。尽管其重要性，该领域缺乏对LLMs研究规划能力的系统理解。

Method: 我们引入了Idea2Plan任务和Idea2Plan Bench，这是一个从200篇ICML 2025 Spotlight和Oral论文中构建的基准，这些论文是在主要LLM训练截止日期之后发布的。我们还提出了Idea2Plan JudgeEval，以评估基于LLM的评判者与专家注释的可靠性。

Result: 实验结果表明，GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在基准测试中表现最强，尽管仍有很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 我们的研究为LLMs在研究规划方面的能力提供了新的见解，并为未来的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了RiddleBench，这是一个包含1,737个挑战性谜题的基准测试，用于评估语言模型在灵活、多方面的推理能力。结果显示，即使是最先进的模型在RiddleBench上的准确率也仅略高于60%，表明存在根本性的弱点。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human intelligence.

Method: We introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737 challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning capabilities.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and 63.16%).

Conclusion: RiddleBench functions as a diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development of more robust and reliable language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

TL;DR: 本文通过细粒度分析语言模型在不同句法情境中的错误，揭示了其在训练过程中的中间学习阶段和行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型通常生成语法正确的文本，但在某些上下文中更容易出错，因此需要更深入地理解它们的中间学习阶段和训练动态。

Method: 基于心理语言学的范式，对不同句法情境中的错误进行细粒度分析，并通过分解精心构建的数据集条件并在训练过程中比较模型性能来更好地理解语法学习的中间阶段。

Result: 识别出训练的不同阶段，其中语言模型的行为与特定启发式方法（如词频和局部上下文）一致，而不是一般的语法规则。

Conclusion: 通过这种方法分析语言模型行为可以作为理解中间学习阶段、整体训练动态和语言模型学到的具体泛化能力的强大工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式 CoT 方法在保留语义对齐和减少生成时间方面存在不足，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了一个对比训练的句子转换器来评估隐式和显式推理之间的语义对齐，并通过微调轻量级语言模型来生成高效的隐式推理。

Result: SemCoT 在效率和效果上均优于现有方法，实验结果证明了其优越性。

Conclusion: SemCoT 是一种新颖的语义对齐隐式 CoT 框架，能够同时优化生成速度和保留与真实推理的语义对齐，实验表明其在效率和效果上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们的研究显示，不同架构、训练数据集和规模的语言模型在预训练过程中表现出高度一致的行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们希望了解语言模型在预训练过程中的行为变化是否具有普遍性。

Method: 我们分析了超过1,400个语言模型检查点，并使用了超过110,000个英文标记的数据集。

Result: 我们发现，高达98%的语言模型行为方差可以由三个简单的启发式方法解释：给定单词的单字概率、单词的n-gram概率以及单词与其上下文之间的语义相似性。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，神经语言模型的学习轨迹可能在很大程度上是相似的，无论模型细节如何。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

Motivation: 尽管语音语言处理中的音素任务（如ASR、PR、G2P和P2G）在概念上相似，但它们通常被单独研究，每个任务都依赖于特定的架构和数据集。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一个统一的框架。

Method: 本文提出了POWSM，这是一个统一的框架，能够联合执行多个与音素相关的任务，如G2P、P2G和ASR。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了POWSM，这是一个统一的框架，能够联合执行多个与音素相关的任务，并在性能上优于或匹配类似大小的专业PR模型，同时支持G2P、P2G和ASR。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanistic interpretability旨在将大型语言模型逆向工程为人类可理解的计算电路，但预训练模型的复杂性常常掩盖了特定推理任务所需的最小机制。

Method: 我们从头开始训练小型的仅注意力变换器在符号化的间接宾语识别（IOI）任务上，通过残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预来研究模型的机制。

Result: 单层模型在没有MLP和归一化层的情况下实现了完美的IOI准确率，两层一个头的模型通过查询-值交互实现了类似性能。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，特定任务的训练可以诱导出高度可解释的最小电路，为探测变压器推理的计算基础提供了一个受控的测试平台。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管取得了有希望的结果，但关于这些模型的泛化能力和它们在内部表示中真正整合音频和文本模态的程度存在越来越多的讨论。

Method: 我们评估了四种SLMs在语音情感识别任务上的表现，使用了一个包含情感不一致的语音样本的数据集。

Result: 我们的结果表明，SLMs主要依赖于文本语义而不是语音情感来执行任务。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，SLMs主要依赖于文本语义而不是语音情感来执行任务，这表明与文本相关的表示在很大程度上超过了声学表示。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

Motivation: 估计阅读理解题的认知复杂性对于在向学习者提供题目之前评估题目难度至关重要。传统的认知特征依赖于人工标注，而现有的自然语言处理工具难以提取这些特征。

Method: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否可以通过关注两个维度——证据范围和转换水平——来估计阅读理解题的认知复杂性。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs可以近似估计阅读理解题的认知复杂性。进一步分析揭示了LLMs的推理能力和元认知意识之间的差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）可以近似估计阅读理解题的认知复杂性，显示出它们作为先验难度分析工具的潜力。然而，LLMs的推理能力和元认知意识之间存在差距，即使它们能产生正确的答案，有时也无法正确识别其自身推理过程中的特征。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

Motivation: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional structure of language.

Method: TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity), a semi-unsupervised framework that uses a transformer-based large language model (tLLM), neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, and Leiden partitioning to reconstruct and interpret multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL) defined contextual boundaries (CBs).

Result: TOPol demonstrates robustness and effectiveness in capturing both affective and non-affective polarity transitions in two corpora: U.S. Central Bank speeches around a macroeconomic breakpoint and Amazon product reviews across rating strata.

Conclusion: TOPol consistently captures both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

Motivation: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions.

Method: We present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain using the CRAFT corpus as our benchmark. We assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT.

Result: While LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.

Conclusion: LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

Motivation: 准确建模通过社交互动的意见变化对于解决虚假信息和极化等问题至关重要。现有的研究显示，单智能体对齐并不能保证真实的多智能体群体动态。

Method: 我们引入了DEBATE，这是第一个大规模的实证基准，专门设计用于评估多智能体角色扮演大型语言模型之间的互动真实性。

Result: 使用DEBATE，我们系统地评估并识别了模拟和真实群体动态之间的关键差异。我们进一步展示了DEBATE在将大型语言模型与人类行为对齐方面的效用，实现了表面指标的改进，同时揭示了更深层次语义对齐的局限性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究突显了角色扮演大型语言模型代理在现实模拟人类社会动态方面的潜力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在开发针对低资源语言的机器翻译模型，特别是针对非洲的低资源语言Lingala。

Method: 本研究探讨了不同的预训练方法，包括在预训练阶段整合多种语言以及使用单语和并行数据。

Result: 研究结果表明，在多种语言上进行预训练并利用单语和并行数据可以显著提高翻译质量。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了有效的预训练策略，有助于缩小高资源语言和低资源语言之间的性能差距，并为开发更具包容性和准确性的NLP模型做出了贡献。

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了关于大型语言模型遗忘的最新研究，提出了新的分类法，并提供了实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆敏感个人数据、版权材料以及可能被恶意使用的知识，因此需要一种技术来选择性地从模型中删除特定知识，同时不影响其整体性能。

Method: 本文引入了新的分类法，将遗忘方法分为训练阶段、训练后阶段和推理阶段，并系统地整理了现有的数据集和评估指标。

Result: 本文对现有方法和评估进行了系统分析，并讨论了关键挑战和未来的研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文综述了自2021年以来关于LLM遗忘的180多篇论文，旨在提供一个系统性的回顾，并为研究社区提供实用指导。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

### [30] [Explainable Disentanglement on Discrete Speech Representations for Noise-Robust ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25150)
*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声的方法，通过端到端模型分离干净语音并提取可解释的噪声向量，从而提高ASR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受到关注，因为它们具有可解释性和与大型语言模型的兼容性，但并不总是针对嘈杂或现实环境进行优化。

Method: 我们的端到端模型将干净语音分离为代码本标记，同时通过轻量级分类器监督提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差。

Result: 我们的方法提高了干净/嘈杂语音和文本之间的对齐，产生了具有高度噪声不变性的语音标记，并提高了ASR性能。保持Whisper冻结，我们展示了相对于Whisper的错误率减少了82%，在VBDemand测试集上比基线方法提高了35%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法提高了干净/嘈杂语音和文本之间的对齐，产生了具有高度噪声不变性的语音标记，并提高了ASR性能。保持Whisper冻结，我们展示了相对于Whisper的错误率减少了82%，在VBDemand测试集上比基线方法提高了35%。进一步的分析表明，学习到的标记空间在已见和未见声学条件下都能很好地泛化。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [31] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDP, a framework that transforms unstructured documents into LLM-ready inputs, and presents MDP-Agent, which improves information-seeking tasks by providing structured knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods return raw text, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. The paper aims to bridge this gap by redefining how models interact with documents.

Method: The paper introduces the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), which transforms unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs through pathways like agentic reasoning, memory grounding, and structured leveraging. It also presents MDP-Agent as an instantiation of this protocol.

Result: Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks show that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

Conclusion: MDP-Agent demonstrates the effectiveness of the MDP framework in improving information-seeking tasks by providing structured, LLM-ready knowledge.

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在不同语言资源下的表现，并发现链式思维提示的效果取决于模型基础能力和任务上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探讨大型语言模型在低资源语言中的表现是否受到数据优势的影响，并研究链式思维提示在跨语言任务中的有效性。

Method: 本文基于Agarwal等人的工作，创建了一个包含10,000个问题的基准测试集，用于评估不同语言资源下的大型语言模型表现。此外，还测试了链式思维提示对模型性能的影响。

Result: 所有模型在英语中表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语和豪萨语中准确率下降，尤其是LLaMA 3。引入链式思维提示后，LLaMA 3的准确率显著提高，而GPT-4和Gemini的表现却因“过度思考”而下降。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了链式思维提示并非普遍有效的解决方案，其效果高度依赖于模型的基础能力以及任务的具体上下文。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ProMediate，这是一个用于评估主动AI调解代理在复杂、多主题、多方谈判中的框架。该框架包含两个核心组件：(i) 基于现实谈判案例和理论驱动难度级别的模拟测试平台，以及一个基于社会认知调解理论的可插拔主动AI调解器；(ii) 一个新的社会认知评估框架，包含一系列指标来衡量共识变化、干预延迟、调解器效果和智能。结果表明，社会智能调解器优于通用基线，通过更快、更精准的干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for agents that can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.

Method: ProMediate consists of two core components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and theory-driven difficulty levels, with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in socio-cognitive mediation theories; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator effectiveness, and intelligence.

Result: Our results show that a socially intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster, better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the generic baseline while being 77% faster in response.

Conclusion: ProMediate provides a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially intelligent agents.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

Conclusion: 大型模型可以高效生成合成数据，而小型模型可以有效地适应它，为低资源、特定领域的问答提供了可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

<details>

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Parrot, a training pipeline that enhances both natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and program chain-of-thought (P-CoT) for mathematical reasoning, achieving significant improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research typically endeavors to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced P-CoT. This paper seeks to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement.

Method: Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems, includes three target-designed subtasks, a subtask hybrid training strategy, and a converted N-CoT auxiliary reward.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline.

Conclusion: Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT.

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Conclusion: 我们的方法在CRMArena-Pro数据集上验证了其有效性，轻量级模型在B2B和B2C业务场景中取得了具有竞争力的结果，证明了其在实际应用中的价值。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究发现，大型语言模型在法律解释中的表现不稳定，与人类判断的相关性较低，因此不建议过度依赖其结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，有学者建议将大型语言模型（LLMs）纳入法律解释工具中，但本文旨在提供实证证据反对这种做法。

Method: 通过实证研究分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律解释中的应用，评估模型在不同问题格式下的解释一致性以及与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 研究发现，模型在不同问题格式下会产生截然不同的结论，且模型与人类判断之间的相关性较弱，存在较大的差异。

Conclusion: 使用生成式AI得出的结论是不可靠的，因为模型的解释判断不稳定，与人类判断的相关性较弱，且在不同模型和问题变体之间存在较大的差异。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

Motivation: 本研究探讨小规模LM是否可以从指令微调中受益。

Method: 我们比较了对话和问答指令微调数据集，分别采用合并或顺序课程，并使用具有100M和140M参数的解码器仅模型。

Result: 结果表明，指令微调在微调场景中产生了小但一致的增益，顺序课程优于合并数据；然而，改进并不总是能转移到零样本任务，这表明在互动导向的适应和广泛的语言泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了将人类启发的学习策略应用于低资源LM的潜力和限制，并指出了在生态训练限制下增强泛化的混合、课程基础方法。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的管道，用于生成合成的治疗对话，以解决AI在心理健康领域开发中的数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于严格的隐私法规和临床会议历史记录很少，AI在心理健康领域的开发受到阻碍。因此，需要一种新的方法来生成合成的治疗对话。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于LLM的管道，该管道根据结构化的客户资料和心理问卷生成合成咨询对话。我们的框架SQPsych通过治疗师-客户模拟将结构化的心理输入转换为自然语言对话。

Result: 我们的SQPsychLLM模型在咨询基准测试中表现出色，超过了基线模型。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，合成数据可以用于开发可扩展、数据安全且具有临床依据的心理健康AI。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive

### [44] [Serve Programs, Not Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25412)
*In Gim,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM服务系统架构，通过提供程序而非提示来解决当前LLM服务系统在处理复杂应用时效率和适应性不足的问题。该架构通过名为Symphony的系统实现，作为LIPs的操作系统，能够通过系统调用暴露LLM模型计算，并通过专用文件系统虚拟化KV缓存，同时通过两级进程调度方案确保GPU效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex LLM applications due to their inflexible design.

Method: We propose a new LLM serving system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server.

Result: We describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling scheme.

Conclusion: Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的自动化注释和筛选框架，用于手语数据集获取，以减少人工努力并保持数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有的手语翻译（SLT）数据集在规模、多语言覆盖范围和成本方面存在限制。由于依赖专家注释和受控录制设置，这些数据集的整理成本高昂。最近，视觉语言模型（VLMs）展示了作为评估者和实时助手的强大能力。然而，在手语数据集获取的背景下，它们的潜力尚未被挖掘。

Method: 我们引入了第一个自动化注释和筛选框架，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）减少对人工努力的依赖，同时保持数据质量。我们的方法应用于八种手语的TikTok视频以及已整理的YouTube-SL-25数据集进行额外评估。

Result: 我们开发了一个基于VLM的管道，包括面部可见性检测、手语活动识别、从视频内容中提取文本以及验证视频和文本之间对齐的判断步骤。使用生成的语料库TikTok-SL-8，我们评估了两种现成的SLT模型在过滤后的德语和美国手语数据集上的性能，以建立基线并评估最近模型在自动提取的、略有噪声的数据上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们的工作实现了可扩展的弱监督预训练，使从社交媒体获取数据成为可能。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型在情境驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，并发现基于隐含意义的提示能显著提升响应的相关性和质量，强调了语言理论在解决人机对齐问题中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们主张，推进人机交互需要关注互动的语言基础，特别是隐含意义（通过共享上下文传达的超出明确陈述的意义），这对于人机对齐至关重要。

Method: 本研究考察了大型语言模型（LLMs）在情境驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，以及理解隐含意义是否能提高响应生成的效果。

Result: 结果表明，较大的模型更接近人类的解释，而较小的模型在隐含意义推理上遇到困难。此外，基于隐含意义的提示显著提高了所有模型响应的相关性和质量，尤其是在较小的模型中取得了显著进展。总体而言，67.6%的参与者更喜欢包含隐含意义提示的响应而不是字面提示。

Conclusion: 我们的工作有助于理解如何利用语言理论来解决对齐问题，使人类与人工智能的交互更加自然和基于上下文。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在精心策划的基准上取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但它们在科研级神经定理证明和证明自动形式化方面的实际影响仍然有限。

Method: 引入RLMEval，这是一个针对这些任务的评估套件，专注于来自现实世界Lean形式化项目的科研级数学。

Result: 对最先进的模型在RLMEval上的评估显示了一个显著的差距：现有基准上的进展并不容易转化为这些更现实的环境，最佳模型仅达到10.3%的通过率。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准，旨在指导和加速形式数学自动化推理的进步。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在定性社会科学研究中越来越被采用，但其应用面临持续的挑战，包括解释偏差、低可靠性以及审计困难。因此，需要一种更系统的方法来评估和使用LLMs。

Method: 本文提出了一种框架，将LLM的使用置于解释深度和自主性两个维度上，以分类LLM在定性研究中的应用，并得出设计建议。基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为工具而非研究主题的社会科学论文，分析了当前文献的状态。

Result: 本文提出了一个框架，用于分类LLM在定性研究中的应用，并提供了实用的设计建议。通过将任务分解为可管理的部分，可以保持低自主性和选择性增加解释深度，从而在监督下提高透明度和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM的使用置于解释深度和自主性两个维度上，本文提供了一种分类LLM在定性研究中的应用并得出实用设计建议的方法。这种方法鼓励研究人员将任务分解为可管理的部分，以保持透明度和可靠性，从而合理利用LLM的优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

TL;DR: 本文分析了SLT评估指标的局限性，并提出需要多模态评估框架以实现更全面的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的SLT评估指标（如BLEU和ROUGE）仅基于文本，不清楚这些指标在多大程度上能可靠地捕捉SLT输出的质量。

Method: 本文分析了六种指标，包括BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT以及基于大语言模型（LLM）的评估器如G-Eval和GEMBA零样本直接评估，并在三种受控条件下评估这些指标的一致性和鲁棒性：改写、模型输出中的幻觉以及句子长度的变化。

Result: 分析表明，基于词法重叠的指标存在局限性，而基于LLM的评估器更能捕捉传统指标可能忽略的语义等价性，但它们也可能对LLM改写的翻译表现出偏见。此外，虽然所有指标都能检测到幻觉，但BLEU过于敏感，而BLEURT和基于LLM的评估器对细微情况较为宽容。

Conclusion: 本文提出了需要多模态评估框架来超越基于文本的指标，以实现对SLT输出更全面的评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，尽管先进模型在角色模拟中达到了中等准确度，但它们在句法风格和记忆回忆等方面仍存在不足。因此，LLM的平均表现仍远低于人类基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理在协作完成共同目标方面的能力尚未得到充分探索，尤其是在信息不对称的情况下，代理之间存在知识和技能的差异，需要合作完成共享任务。

Method: 我们将爱因斯坦谜题扩展为一个桌面游戏，在这个游戏中，两个LLM代理必须推理、沟通和行动以满足解决谜题所需的时空和关系约束。我们应用了一个微调加验证器框架，其中LLM代理配备了各种沟通策略和来自环境的验证信号。

Result: 实证结果强调了对齐沟通的重要性，特别是在代理同时具备信息获取和提供能力的情况下。有趣的是，没有沟通的代理仍然可以实现高任务性能；然而，进一步分析显示缺乏真正的规则理解以及人类评估者的信任度较低。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

### [54] [FARSIQA: Faithful and Advanced RAG System for Islamic Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25621)
*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Behrooz Minaei Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为FARSIQA的新系统，用于波斯伊斯兰领域的忠实高级问答。该系统基于FAIR-RAG架构，能够处理复杂的多跳查询，并在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中取得了优异的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在高风险、专业领域如宗教问答中的应用受到幻觉和不忠于权威来源的挑战。这对于波斯语穆斯林社区尤其重要，因为准确性和可信度至关重要。现有的检索增强生成（RAG）系统依赖于简单的单次流程，在需要多步骤推理和证据聚合的复杂查询上表现不足。

Method: 我们引入了FARSIQA，这是一个针对波斯伊斯兰领域的忠实高级问答的端到端系统。FARSIQA基于我们创新的FAIR-RAG架构：一种用于RAG的忠实、自适应、迭代优化框架。

Result: FARSIQA在具有挑战性的伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中表现出色，达到了97.0%的负拒绝率（比基线高出40个百分点），以及74.3%的高答案正确率。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为波斯伊斯兰问答设定了新标准，并验证了我们的迭代、自适应架构对于在敏感领域构建忠实、可靠的AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TTS在数学和编程等正式领域已被证明有效，但在法律等论证领域仍缺乏研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用一组7个奖励模型，在现实的低-N预算下评估结果级（Best-of-N）和过程级（树搜索）验证。

Result: 本文系统地研究了验证器效用如何受到领域专业化、模型大小和监督类型等因素的影响，即使在不同角色下应用也是如此。

Conclusion: 本文对基于验证器的TTS方法在法律多项选择题问答中的应用进行了实证研究，并系统地分析了验证器效用受领域专业化、模型大小和监督类型等因素的影响。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

*Andreas Opedal,Yanick Zengaffinen,Haruki Shirakami,Clemente Pasti,Mrinmaya Sachan,Abulhair Saparov,Ryan Cotterell,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估语言模型推理效率的新框架，发现当前模型在面对无关信息时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估标准强调正确性，而忽略了人类推理的一个关键方面：效率。在现实世界的推理场景中，许多可用信息是无关的，有效的演绎推理需要识别并忽略这些干扰。

Method: 通过逻辑编程的视角提出了一种评估语言模型推理效率的框架，引入了一种将自然语言编写的证明与逻辑程序执行找到的最短证明对齐的简单方法。

Result: 构建了一个包含各种数量无关公理的数学应用题数据集，这些公理在语义上与目标定理有不同程度的重叠。实验结果表明，当前的语言模型在这些条件下表现出明显的准确性下降。

Conclusion: 当前的语言模型在存在无关公理的情况下表现出明显的准确性下降，并且生成的证明经常包含不必要的推理路径。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench to advance EHR analysis by improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities.

Method: We present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning instruction dataset, and develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. We also introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark to assess reasoning and prediction across EHR scenarios.

Result: EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs, surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving a 10% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

Conclusion: EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

*Jiani Zheng,Zhiyang Teng,Xiangtai Li,Anran Wang,Yu Tian,Kunpeng Qiu,Ye Tian,Haochen Wang,Zhuochen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PairUni的统一框架，通过重新组织数据为理解-生成对，并利用Pair-GPRO进行优化，从而在强化学习中实现更平衡的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型（UVLMs）必须在一个架构中执行理解和生成，但这些任务依赖于异构数据和监督，使得在强化学习（RL）中平衡它们变得困难。

Method: 我们提出了PairUni，这是一个统一框架，将数据重新组织为理解-生成（UG）对，并相应地对齐优化。我们首先使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，为理解样本生成描述，为生成样本生成问题-答案（QA）对，从同一实例中形成对齐对。此外，对于每个生成样本，我们检索一个语义相关的理解示例以形成检索对，连接不同但相关的数据点。这些配对结构暴露了跨任务语义对应关系并支持一致的策略学习。为了利用这种结构，我们提出了Pair-GPRO，这是一种基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的配对感知变体。它为每对分配相似性得分以调节优势，加强从良好对齐示例中的学习并减少任务干扰。

Result: 我们整理了一个名为PairUG的高质量UG对数据集，用于RL微调，并在强大的Janus-Pro UVLM上评估了PairUni。我们的方法在各种UVLM上实现了平衡的改进，并超过了强大的UVLM RL基线。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在各种UVLM上实现了平衡的改进，并超过了强大的UVLM RL基线。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

TL;DR: 本研究比较了零样本大型语言模型和LightGBM在贷款违约预测任务中的表现，发现大型语言模型在金融风险预测中存在局限性，并对其自我生成的解释的可信度提出了质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型在结构化表格数据中的适用性，特别是在高风险的金融应用中，如财务风险评估。

Method: 本研究对零样本大型语言模型分类器和LightGBM进行了系统比较，评估了它们的预测性能，使用SHAP分析了特征归因，并评估了大型语言模型生成的自我解释的可靠性。

Result: 虽然大型语言模型能够识别关键的财务风险指标，但它们的特征重要性排名与LightGBM明显不同，而且它们的自我解释往往与经验性的SHAP归因不一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在风险敏感的金融环境中部署大型语言模型时，需要进行可解释性审计、与可解释模型的基线比较以及人工监督的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Toolathlon，一个用于评估语言代理在现实世界中执行多步骤任务能力的基准测试，涵盖了32个软件应用和604个工具，并展示了当前最先进的模型在此基准上的表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言代理基准测试通常集中在狭窄领域或简化任务上，缺乏评估代理在现实世界中表现所需的多样性、真实性和长期复杂性。

Method: 我们引入了Tool Decathlon（称为Toolathlon），这是一个用于语言代理的基准测试，提供多样化的应用程序和工具、现实的环境设置以及基于执行的可靠评估。

Result: 对最先进的模型进行全面评估突显了它们的重大不足：表现最好的模型Claude-4.5-Sonnet仅达到38.6%的成功率，而顶级开源权重模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp达到20.1%。

Conclusion: 我们期望Toolathlon能够推动更强大语言代理的开发，以执行现实世界中的长期任务。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过说服性提示从故意遗忘的大型语言模型中恢复事实知识的可能性，并提出了SKeB框架来评估遗忘的完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an open problem.

Method: Drawing from ACT-R and Hebbian theory, as well as communication principles, we introduce the Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive framing.

Result: Persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B).

Conclusion: SKeB provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and overall behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Ouro，一个预训练的Looped Language Models (LoopLM)家族，通过将推理融入预训练阶段，实现了优于现有技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM主要通过显式文本生成（如链式思维CoT）进行“思考”，这将推理推迟到训练后，并且没有充分利用预训练数据。

Method: 我们提出了Ouro，这是一个预训练的Looped Language Models (LoopLM)家族，通过（i）潜在空间中的迭代计算，（ii）用于学习深度分配的熵正则化目标，以及（iii）扩展到7.7T个标记来将推理融入预训练阶段。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在广泛的基准测试中表现出色，其性能可与高达12B的SOTA LLM相媲美。通过受控实验，我们表明这种优势不是来自增加的知识容量，而是来自更优越的知识操作能力。

Conclusion: 我们的结果展示了LoopLM在推理时代作为新型扩展方向的潜力。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Motivation: 当前对代理的评估主要集中在一次性任务完成上，未能考虑到许多现实问题本质上是迭代和协作的，而人类目标往往是不明确且不断变化的。

Method: 本文引入了协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估来验证其有效性。

Result: 研究表明，最先进的代理在多轮、现实场景中表现不佳，揭示了代理设计中缺失的关键要素：维持参与和促进用户理解的能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的评估框架——协作努力扩展，以更好地衡量代理在多轮、现实场景中的表现，并指出当前最先进的代理在这些场景中表现不佳，缺乏维持参与和促进用户理解的能力。

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

Conclusion: 本文提出了DiagramEval，这是一种新的评估指标，用于评估由大型语言模型生成的示意图。通过将示意图概念化为图，DiagramEval使用节点对齐和路径对齐两个新的度量组来评估示意图质量。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

Conclusion: DecompTune 显著提高了归属质量，超过了之前的方法，并与最先进的前沿模型相匹配或超越。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Method: 研究数据过滤和污染如何相互作用以塑造基准和生成性能。引入了无害的数据中毒，提供了一个现实的安全研究测试平台。

Result: 发现过滤语言质量可以提高文本流畅性和连贯性，但会得到较差的基准结果；而后期有意污染（继续在包含测试集的数据混合上进行训练）可以恢复具有竞争力的分数，仅适度损害生成质量。通常的神经过滤可能会无意中放大基准泄漏。

Conclusion: 通过公开发布所有模型、数据集、代码和检查点，Gaperon为探索多语言语言模型开发中的数据整理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡奠定了可重复的基础。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

### [67] [Process-Level Trajectory Evaluation for Environment Configuration in Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25694)
*Jiayi Kuang,Yinghui Li,Xin Zhang,Yangning Li,Di Yin,Xing Sun,Ying Shen,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Enconda-bench 是一个用于评估软件工程代理在环境配置过程中能力的新基准，能够提供过程级分析和端到端可执行性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理在软件工程中显示出潜力，但环境配置仍然是瓶颈，因为需要大量手动工作且缺乏大规模、高质量的数据集。现有的基准测试仅评估端到端构建/测试成功，掩盖了代理成功或失败的位置和原因。

Method: 引入了 Enconda-bench 基准测试，提供过程级轨迹评估，以分析代理在环境设置规划、感知驱动的错误诊断、反馈驱动的修复和执行最终环境配置时的细粒度能力。任务实例通过注入真实的 README 错误自动构建，并在 Docker 中验证以实现可扩展的高质量评估。

Result: 评估结果显示，虽然代理可以定位错误，但它们在将反馈转化为有效修正方面存在困难，从而限制了端到端性能。

Conclusion: Enconda-bench 是第一个提供环境配置过程级内部能力评估的框架，为改进软件工程代理提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but
environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and
scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only
end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.
We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,
which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent
capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error
diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment
configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting
realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality
evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end
executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.
Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while
agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective
corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench
is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment
for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving
software engineering agents.

### [68] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉-语言模型表现出与人类相似的冲突适应行为，并通过分析模型内部结构揭示了这一行为的潜在机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨视觉-语言模型是否能够表现出类似人类的认知控制行为，特别是冲突适应现象。

Method: 研究人员使用顺序Stroop任务来测试视觉-语言模型的行为，并利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）来识别InternVL 3.5 4B中的任务相关超节点。

Result: 12种视觉-语言模型表现出与冲突适应一致的行为，而一种模型可能由于上限效应未能表现出这种行为。此外，研究人员发现了部分重叠的超节点，并发现一个受冲突调节的超节点在减少Stroop错误中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究发现，12种视觉-语言模型表现出与冲突适应一致的行为，这表明这些模型可能在某种程度上模拟了人类的认知控制机制。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

*Eshika Khandelwal,Junyu Xie,Tengda Han,Max Bain,Arsha Nagrani,Andrew Zisserman,Gül Varol,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的方法CoherentAD，用于生成连贯且信息丰富的音频描述序列，优于依赖独立生成的先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数自动方法独立生成每个AD，导致重复和不连贯的描述。为了使AD有效，它们必须形成连贯的序列，帮助听众想象正在展开的场景。

Method: 我们提出了一种无需训练的方法CoherentAD，首先为每个AD时间间隔生成多个候选描述，然后进行自回归选择以形成连贯且信息丰富的叙述。

Result: 我们引入了一个序列级度量标准StoryRecall，用于衡量预测的AD如何传达真实叙述，并引入了重复度量标准，以捕捉连续AD输出之间的冗余。

Conclusion: 我们的方法生成了具有增强叙事理解的连贯AD序列，优于依赖独立生成的先前方法。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

TL;DR: AmarDoctor 是一种多语言语音交互数字健康应用，旨在为孟加拉语使用者提供全面的患者分诊和人工智能驱动的临床决策支持。它通过双界面系统提高初级护理服务的质量，并在临床准确性方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的健康平台主要服务于欧洲人口和语言，而孟加拉语使用者在数字医疗方面存在显著的不足。因此，AmarDoctor 的开发旨在填补这一空白，为孟加拉语使用者提供更好的医疗服务。

Method: AmarDoctor 采用数据驱动的方法来加强初级护理服务并实现个性化的健康管理。它使用自适应提问算法评估症状，并通过语音交互人工智能助手克服数字素养障碍。此外，还提供了面向临床医生的界面，利用人工智能支持决策，提高工作效率。

Result: AmarDoctor 在临床准确性方面表现出色，其诊断精度达到81.08%，而医生的平均诊断精度为50.27%。此外，其专科推荐精度达到91.35%，而医生的平均推荐精度为62.6%。

Conclusion: AmarDoctor 是一种多语言语音交互数字健康应用，能够为孟加拉语使用者提供全面的患者分诊和人工智能驱动的临床决策支持。该应用通过双界面系统，提高了初级护理服务的质量，并在临床准确性方面表现出色。

Abstract: This study presents AmarDoctor, a multilingual voice-interactive digital
health app designed to provide comprehensive patient triage and AI-driven
clinical decision support for Bengali speakers, a population largely
underserved in access to digital healthcare. AmarDoctor adopts a data-driven
approach to strengthen primary care delivery and enable personalized health
management. While platforms such as AdaHealth, WebMD, Symptomate, and K-Health
have become popular in recent years, they mainly serve European demographics
and languages. AmarDoctor addresses this gap with a dual-interface system for
both patients and healthcare providers, supporting three major Bengali
dialects. At its core, the patient module uses an adaptive questioning
algorithm to assess symptoms and guide users toward the appropriate specialist.
To overcome digital literacy barriers, it integrates a voice-interactive AI
assistant that navigates users through the app services. Complementing this,
the clinician-facing interface incorporates AI-powered decision support that
enhances workflow efficiency by generating structured provisional diagnoses and
treatment recommendations. These outputs inform key services such as
e-prescriptions, video consultations, and medical record management. To
validate clinical accuracy, the system was evaluated against a gold-standard
set of 185 clinical vignettes developed by experienced physicians.
Effectiveness was further assessed by comparing AmarDoctor performance with
five independent physicians using the same vignette set. Results showed
AmarDoctor achieved a top-1 diagnostic precision of 81.08 percent (versus
physicians average of 50.27 percent) and a top specialty recommendation
precision of 91.35 percent (versus physicians average of 62.6 percent).

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Contextual and Cultural Intelligence (CCI)框架，旨在使AI系统能够处理文化意义，而不仅仅是数据模式。通过实证研究，本文验证了CCI框架的有效性，并展示了其在非洲市场的潜在应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球AI发展优先考虑模型性能和计算规模，但在非洲市场有意义的部署需要根本不同的架构决策。因此，本文旨在提出一种新的框架，以更好地适应非洲市场的文化和社会需求。

Method: 本文使用设计科学方法论验证了CCI框架，并通过一个服务于侨民社区的生产AI原生跨境购物平台进行了实证研究。

Result: 实证结果表明，89%的用户更喜欢通过WhatsApp与AI互动，而不是传统的网页界面。此外，文化启发的提示工程展示了对文化情境化查询的复杂理解，包括89%的家庭导向商业模式和自然的语言切换接受度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了CCI框架，该框架通过本地相关的、情感智能的和经济包容性设计，使AI系统能够处理文化意义，而不仅仅是数据模式。该工作挑战了硅谷的设计正统观念，同时为资源匮乏市场的公平AI部署提供了可操作的框架。

Abstract: While global AI development prioritizes model performance and computational
scale, meaningful deployment in African markets requires fundamentally
different architectural decisions. This paper introduces Contextual and
Cultural Intelligence (CCI) -- a systematic framework enabling AI systems to
process cultural meaning, not just data patterns, through locally relevant,
emotionally intelligent, and economically inclusive design. Using design
science methodology, we validate CCI through a production AI-native
cross-border shopping platform serving diaspora communities. Key empirical
findings: 89% of users prefer WhatsApp-based AI interaction over traditional
web interfaces (n=602, chi-square=365.8, p<0.001), achieving 536 WhatsApp users
and 3,938 total conversations across 602 unique users in just 6 weeks, and
culturally informed prompt engineering demonstrates sophisticated understanding
of culturally contextualized queries, with 89% family-focused commerce patterns
and natural code-switching acceptance. The CCI framework operationalizes three
technical pillars: Infrastructure Intelligence (mobile-first, resilient
architectures), Cultural Intelligence (multilingual NLP with social context
awareness), and Commercial Intelligence (trust-based conversational commerce).
This work contributes both theoretical innovation and reproducible
implementation patterns, challenging Silicon Valley design orthodoxies while
providing actionable frameworks for equitable AI deployment across
resource-constrained markets.

*Qi Lin,Zhenyu Zhang,Viraj Thakkar,Zhenjie Sun,Mai Zheng,Zhichao Cao*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: StorageXTuner是一个基于LLM代理的自动调优框架，旨在解决存储系统配置困难的问题。它通过分离四个代理来提高性能，并在多个存储引擎上取得了显著的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动配置存储系统很困难，因为参数空间大且条件在工作负载、部署和版本之间变化。现有的基于LLM的方法通常将调优视为单次、系统特定的任务，限制了跨系统重用，约束了探索，并削弱了验证。

Method: StorageXTuner是一个基于LLM代理的自动调优框架，包含四个代理：执行器（沙箱基准测试）、提取器（性能摘要）、搜索器（基于见解的配置探索）和反思者（见解生成和管理）。

Result: StorageXTuner在RocksDB、LevelDB、CacheLib和MySQL InnoDB上进行了评估，相对于默认设置和ELMo-Tune，达到了高达575%和111%的吞吐量提升，将p99延迟降低了多达88%和56%，并且收敛所需的试验次数更少。

Conclusion: StorageXTuner能够显著提高存储系统的性能，并且在较少的试验次数下就能收敛。

Abstract: Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large
and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and
ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under
changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a
single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains
exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM
agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines.
StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed
benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided
configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management).
The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that
promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to
guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on
RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C.
Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up
to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and
56%, and converges with fewer trials.

### [73] [The Epistemic Suite: A Post-Foundational Diagnostic Methodology for Assessing AI Knowledge Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24721)
*Matthew Kelly*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Epistemic Suite的诊断方法，用于揭示AI输出的认识论条件，并提供了一种中介层，使人类判断能够更好地理解AI输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的文本可能误导用户，使其误认为模拟的一致性是真正的理解。因此，需要一种方法来揭示AI输出的认识论条件，并提供一种中介层，使人类判断能够更好地理解AI输出。

Method: 论文介绍了Epistemic Suite，这是一种后基础诊断方法，通过二十个诊断镜头来揭示AI输出的认识论条件。该方法基于三个设计原则：诊断生产而非评估声明，优先考虑诊断牵引力而不是基础解决，以及将反思性作为结构性要求。

Result: Epistemic Suite能够将语言模型转换为诊断立场，产生可检查的工件（如标志、注释、矛盾地图和暂停日志），创建AI输出和人类判断之间的中介层。此外，它引入了认识论暂停作为实践者执行的断路器，以在证据超出时停止继续。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个名为Epistemic Suite的诊断方法，用于揭示AI输出产生的认识论条件，并通过一系列诊断镜头来揭示诸如信心洗白、叙事压缩、移位权威和时间漂移等模式。该方法强调了诊断生产而非评估声明、优先考虑诊断牵引力而不是基础解决以及将反思性作为结构性要求而不是伦理装饰的设计原则。它提供了一种中介层，使人类判断能够更好地理解AI输出，并引入了认识论暂停作为实践者执行的断路器，以在证据超出时停止继续。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent, plausible text that can mislead
users into mistaking simulated coherence for genuine understanding. This paper
introduces the Epistemic Suite, a post-foundational diagnostic methodology for
surfacing the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced and
received. Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through
twenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to
reveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced
authority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles:
diagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction
over foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural
requirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts
language models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable
artifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS
bundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment.
A key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit
breaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based
on judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage
Protocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link
activation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and
pluralism safeguards. Unlike internalist approaches that embed alignment into
model architectures (e.g., RLHF or epistemic-integrity proposals), the Suite
operates externally as scaffolding, preserving expendability and refusal as
safeguards rather than failures. It preserves the distinction between
performance and understanding, enabling accountable deliberation while
maintaining epistemic modesty.

Motivation: 研究旨在确定大型语言模型是否能够识别潜在的底层因素和干预途径，通过分析非裔美国人的叙事来揭示影响医疗结果差距的因素。

Method: 研究使用了LDA技术来识别非裔美国人故事中的主题，并利用开源的LLM-based分层摘要方法对每个主题的故事进行摘要生成。此外，还使用GPT4模型对生成的主题摘要进行评估，并与领域专家的评估进行比较以验证可靠性。

Result: 研究识别出了26个主题，GPT4的评估表明主题摘要没有虚构内容，准确性高、全面且有用，且GPT评分与专家评估之间显示出中等到高的一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了使用大型语言模型（LLM）和潜在狄利克雷分布（LDA）技术从非裔美国人的故事中识别和总结相关主题的潜力，这些发现可以为健康研究和临床改进提供新的途径，从而最终改善健康结果。

Abstract: Storytelling is a powerful form of communication and may provide insights
into factors contributing to gaps in healthcare outcomes. To determine whether
Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify potential underlying factors and
avenues for intervention, we performed topic-aware hierarchical summarization
of narratives from African American (AA) storytellers. Fifty transcribed
stories of AA experiences were used to identify topics in their experience
using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Stories about a given
topic were summarized using an open-source LLM-based hierarchical summarization
approach. Topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries
for each story that addressed a given topic. Generated topic summaries were
rated for fabrication, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness by the GPT4
model, and the model's reliability was validated against the original story
summaries by two domain experts. 26 topics were identified in the fifty AA
stories. The GPT4 ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from
fabrication, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful. The reliability of GPT
ratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement. Our
approach identified AA experience-relevant topics such as health behaviors,
interactions with medical team members, caregiving and symptom management,
among others. Such insights could help researchers identify potential factors
and interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient
manner-leveraging the communicative power of storytelling. The use of LDA and
LLMs to identify and summarize the experience of AA individuals suggests a
variety of possible avenues for health research and possible clinical
improvements to support patients and caregivers, thereby ultimately improving
health outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PANORAMA数据集，这是一个包含8,143个美国专利审查记录的数据集，旨在帮助研究者分析大型语言模型在专利审查过程中的能力。研究发现，尽管大型语言模型在检索相关现有技术方面表现良好，但在评估专利权利要求的新颖性和非显而易见性方面仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利审查仍然是自然语言处理文献中的一个持续挑战，即使在大型语言模型（LLMs）出现之后，因为它需要对提交的主张是否符合新颖性和非显而易见性的法定标准进行广泛而细致的人类判断。以往的自然语言处理研究将这一挑战视为预测任务（例如，预测授权结果），使用了诸如相似性度量或基于历史标签的分类器等高级代理。然而，这种方法往往忽略了审查员必须进行的逐步评估，包括在办公室行动文件中提供的决策理由，这也使得衡量当前专利审查过程的技术状态变得更加困难。

Method: 我们构建了一个名为PANORAMA的数据集，其中包含8,143个美国专利审查记录，保留了完整的决策路径，包括原始申请、所有引用的参考文献、非最终拒绝和允许通知。此外，PANORAMA将这些路径分解为顺序基准，模拟专利专业人员的专利审查过程，并允许研究人员检查大型语言模型在每个步骤中的能力。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，尽管大型语言模型在检索相关现有技术和定位相关段落方面相对有效，但它们在评估专利权利要求的新颖性和非显而易见性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，尽管大型语言模型在检索相关现有技术方面相对有效，但它们在评估专利权利要求的新颖性和非显而易见性方面存在困难。我们讨论了这些结果，并认为要推动自然语言处理（包括大型语言模型）在专利领域的进步，需要更深入地理解现实世界的专利审查过程。

Abstract: Patent examination remains an ongoing challenge in the NLP literature even
after the advent of large language models (LLMs), as it requires an extensive
yet nuanced human judgment on whether a submitted claim meets the statutory
standards of novelty and non-obviousness against previously granted claims --
prior art -- in expert domains. Previous NLP studies have approached this
challenge as a prediction task (e.g., forecasting grant outcomes) with
high-level proxies such as similarity metrics or classifiers trained on
historical labels. However, this approach often overlooks the step-by-step
evaluations that examiners must make with profound information, including
rationales for the decisions provided in office actions documents, which also
makes it harder to measure the current state of techniques in patent review
processes. To fill this gap, we construct PANORAMA, a dataset of 8,143 U.S.
patent examination records that preserves the full decision trails, including
original applications, all cited references, Non-Final Rejections, and Notices
of Allowance. Also, PANORAMA decomposes the trails into sequential benchmarks
that emulate patent professionals' patent review processes and allow
researchers to examine large language models' capabilities at each step of
them. Our findings indicate that, although LLMs are relatively effective at
retrieving relevant prior art and pinpointing the pertinent paragraphs, they
struggle to assess the novelty and non-obviousness of patent claims. We discuss
these results and argue that advancing NLP, including LLMs, in the patent
domain requires a deeper understanding of real-world patent examination. Our
dataset is openly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音理解基准主要依赖于多项选择题回答（MCQA）格式，这在捕捉语音中的非语言特征如何影响模型行为方面不可靠。

Method: 通过开放式的生成任务和语音情感识别来探测SFMs，并引入了一个新的并行数据集，该数据集包含对语音质量的合成修改，以评估SFMs对破音和气声的响应。

Result: 本文介绍了新的并行数据集，用于评估SFMs对破音和气声的响应，并提供了对SFMs对这些非词汇语音感知方面敏感性的首次考察。

Conclusion: 本文提供了对语音基础模型（SFMs）对这些特定非词汇语音感知方面的敏感性的首次考察。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct
processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual
representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially
respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.
One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,
encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation
types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and
social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely
rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to
failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic
features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through
open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether
model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce
a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,
designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work
provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular
non-lexical aspects of speech perception.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo is a novel protocol that uses swarm intelligence and distributed pairwise ranking consensus to improve AI inference performance, offering superior accuracy, resilience, and security in decentralized AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As centralized AI faces compute ceilings and diminishing returns, meeting demand requires an inference layer that scales horizontally in both capacity and capability.

Method: Fortytwo leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. It uses peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models and incorporates on-chain reputation to adapt node influence to demonstrated accuracy. The protocol also employs proof-of-capability to resist Sybil attacks.

Result: Swarm inference substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set. The protocol shows higher accuracy and strong resilience to adversarial and noisy free-form prompting across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fortytwo establishes a foundation for decentralized AI systems, democratizing access to high-quality inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or security.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or

*Xiutian Zhao,Rochelle Choenni,Rohit Saxena,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了视觉-语言模型在处理文化相关输入时的表现，发现了文化敏感神经元的存在，并提出了一种新的方法来识别这些神经元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉-语言模型（VLMs）表现出色，但它们在文化相关的输入上仍然存在困难。为了理解VLMs如何处理文化基础的信息，我们研究了文化敏感神经元的存在。

Method: 我们使用CVQA基准测试来识别文化选择性神经元，并通过去激活由不同识别方法标记的神经元进行因果测试。此外，我们提出了一种新的基于边距的选择器——对比激活选择（CAS），并展示了它在识别文化敏感神经元方面优于现有的基于概率和熵的方法。

Result: 实验表明，某些神经元的消融会显著影响对应文化的问答性能，而对其他文化的影响较小。此外，CAS方法在识别文化敏感神经元方面表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果揭示了多模态表示的内部组织结构的新见解。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

Conclusion: 本文表明，语言模型的低秩结构可以用于生成任务，并提供了理论分析和学习保证。

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种混合量子-经典循环神经网络（QRNN）架构，该架构在模拟中表现出与强大经典基线相当的性能，并在多个序列学习任务中展示了其有效性。

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

### [81] [ZK-SenseLM: Verifiable Large-Model Wireless Sensing with Selective Abstention and Zero-Knowledge Attestation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25677)

TL;DR: ZK-SenseLM 是一种安全且可审计的无线感知框架，结合了大型模型编码器和零知识证明，实现了在各种任务中的高性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少分布偏移下的不安全行为，同时保持系统的安全性和可审计性，ZK-SenseLM 提出了一种新的无线感知框架。

Method: ZK-SenseLM 采用了一个大型模型编码器，结合基于策略的决策层和端到端的零知识证明，实现无线感知的安全性和可审计性。它包括一个四阶段的证明流程，以及微批处理证明和网关选项。

Result: ZK-SenseLM 在活动、存在或入侵、呼吸代理和 RF 指纹识别任务中表现出色，提高了宏-F1 和校准，产生了有利的覆盖-风险曲线，并通过紧凑的证明和快速验证拒绝了篡改和重放攻击。

Conclusion: ZK-SenseLM 在各种任务中提高了宏-F1 和校准，产生了有利的覆盖-风险曲线，并通过紧凑的证明和快速验证拒绝了篡改和重放攻击。

Abstract: ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a
large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave
radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end
zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral
pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal
alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens.
To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated
selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is
registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving
pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version
binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the
quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and
confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a
gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates
with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization
without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are
part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion,
respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1
and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and
rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.

### [82] [KnowCoder-A1: Incentivizing Agentic Reasoning Capability with Outcome Supervision for KBQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25101)
*Zhuo Chen,Fei Wang,Zixuan Li,Zhao Zhang,Weiwei Ding,Chuanguang Yang,Yongjun Xu,Xiaolong Jin,Jiafeng Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了KnowCoder-A1，这是一种能够自主执行代理推理的大型语言模型，通过仅结果监督下的多阶段课程强化学习进行训练，表现出强大的推理能力，并在多个数据集上优于之前的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在过程监督下微调LLM，这为探索提供了弱激励，因此未能增强代理推理能力。本文旨在提出一种能够自主执行代理推理的LLM，以解决这一问题。

Method: KnowCoder-A1通过仅结果监督下的多阶段课程强化学习进行训练，首先在通过基于结果的拒绝采样获得的小规模高质量轨迹上微调LLM，然后应用从简单到困难的奖励计划来缓解奖励稀疏性问题。

Result: KnowCoder-A1在三个主流数据集上表现出色，特别是在GrailQA的零样本子集上，使用仅十二分之一的训练数据就实现了11.1%的相对提升。

Conclusion: KnowCoder-A1在三个主流数据集上表现出强大的推理行为，并优于之前的方法。特别是在GrailQA的零样本子集上，使用仅十二分之一的训练数据就实现了11.1%的相对提升，展示了其强大的代理推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出RAVR框架，利用答案引导的推理提高大型语言模型的推理能力，并在多个领域取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖于语言模型生成高价值推理路径，但对于超出其能力的任务，这种路径难以采样，导致学习风险。认知科学表明，'为什么是这个答案'比'是什么答案'更容易，因为避免了开放探索的认知负担。

Method: RAVR（Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning）是一种端到端框架，利用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分替代。

Result: 实验结果表明，在通用和数学领域，RAVR均优于强基线。RAVR减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了特定问题的策略。

Conclusion: RAVR框架能够通过答案引导的推理提升大型语言模型的推理能力，并在多个领域表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Motivation: 精神疾病共病在临床上具有重要意义，但由于多种同时发生的障碍的复杂性而具有挑战性。需要一种新的方法来生成高质量的对话数据集，以提高诊断准确性和治疗计划。

Method: 开发了一种新方法，结合了合成患者电子病历（EMR）构建和多代理诊断对话生成。创建了502个合成EMR，并构建了一个多代理框架，将临床访谈协议转换为分层状态机和上下文树，支持超过130个诊断状态。

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk 是一个具有高结构和语言保真度的大型对话数据集，能够支持多障碍精神疾病筛查，并为精神疾病共病研究提供有价值的资源。

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

TL;DR: GAP框架通过图-based planning建模任务依赖关系，实现自适应并行和串行工具执行，提高了执行效率和任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有范式如ReAct依赖于顺序推理和执行，未能利用独立子任务之间的固有并行性，导致工具利用率低和多步骤推理场景下的性能不佳。

Method: GAP框架通过图-based planning显式建模任务间依赖关系，训练代理基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定哪些工具可以并行执行，哪些必须遵循顺序依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明，GAP在MHQA数据集上显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步骤检索任务中，同时通过智能并行化实现了工具调用效率的大幅提高。

Conclusion: GAP框架在多步骤检索任务中显著优于传统的ReAct基线，并通过智能并行化实现了工具调用效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is
