In a study using a 3-tone\n(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four\nopen-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480\ntrials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.\nFriendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%\nYES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue\n(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This\ncore association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical\ntests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse\nclassification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still\noverwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the\ntime). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a\npreamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under\nambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text\nrather than a multi-turn chat.

Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,\nwe train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,\nand a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation\nmetrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined\nAlignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs.

Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides\nstandardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with\nbrain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those\nfeatures onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the\nresulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline\ncovering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can\neasily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core\ninfrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus\nfeature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling\napproaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in\nlogging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms\nsuch as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility\nof our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening\ndatasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore\nthe methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous\nfMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR\nscan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),\nincorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize\ninformation leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model\npredictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model\nimplementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,\nfosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality\nhigh-performance predictive models of brain activity.\n  Project page: https://litcoder-brain.github.io", "AI": {"tldr": "LITcoder\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fde\u7eed\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0e\u8111\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u523a\u6fc0\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8868\u5f81\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8111\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\u8046\u542c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86LITcoder\u3002", "method": "LITcoder\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fde\u7eed\u523a\u6fc0\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\uff09\u4e0e\u8111\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c06\u523a\u6fc0\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8868\u5f81\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8111\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\u8046\u542c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08LeBel\u7b49\u4eba\uff0c2023\u5e74\uff0cNarratives\u548cLittle Prince\uff09\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eedfMRI\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u8003\u8651TR\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6ede\u540e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8003\u8651\u5934\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "LITcoder\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

While existing\nworks achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content\nand fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual\nbiases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output\nlabels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ncounterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious\ncorrelations.

However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of\nsupervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer\nlearning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.\nThis paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,\nusing citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL\ncitations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we\ndevelop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models\n(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and\napplications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.\nCross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based\nretrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that\naligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG\nassociations.

We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines\ndense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to\nimprove both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that\nevaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data\nstratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:\nlow, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables\na fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful\nsubspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG\nintegration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT\nmodels augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR\nregion, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings\nhighlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also\nthe importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model\nbehavior.

Ablations on\ndifferent CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other\nmethods, which may be of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5747\u503c\u6d88\u878d\uff08CAMA\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7aa5\u89c6\uff08ABP\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7CAMA\u548cABP\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684All-for-One\u5b50\u56fe\uff08AF1\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u665a\u7684\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u5728\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5b50\u56fe\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5145\u5206\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u98ce\u683c\u3002"}}

Previous methods mainly focus\non creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional\nreinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by\nusing Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we\nidentify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude\nof policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to\ninefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially\ndestabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose\nEntropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the\nlearning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG\namplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,\nand attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We\nfurther introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to\nfind more predictable solution paths.

Despite substantial progress enabled by\nlarge-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two\nfundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale\nhuman-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited\ngeneralization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can\ndramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural\nquestion: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action\nplanning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL\nframework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce\nVLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment\nrendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,\nSimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\\pi_0$\non RoboTwin 1.0\\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.\nSimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust\ngeneralization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.\nMoreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,\nwherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in\nthe previous training process.
