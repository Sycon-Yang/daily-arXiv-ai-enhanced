<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic framework that comprehensively organizes automatic evaluation methods across text, visual, and audio modalities.

Method: Comprehensive review and unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across all three modalities.

Result: Identified five fundamental paradigms that characterize existing evaluation approaches across text, visual, and audio domains.

Conclusion: Discusses promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce TaskCraft, an automated workflow for generating scalable agentic tasks with tool interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction data lacks tool interaction and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation.

Method: TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using depth-based and width-based extensions.

Result: Empirical results show that these tasks improve prompt optimization and enhance supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Present a large-scale synthetic dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

### [3] [A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077)
*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues that linguistic forms do not possess meaning by themselves but gain meaning through an observer-dependent interpretive act.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models and other NLP systems caused by semantic degeneracy.

Method: Using Kolmogorov complexity and conducting a semantic Bell inequality test with diverse LLM agents to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contexts.

Result: Found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs violating the classical boundary.

Conclusion: Linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, implying that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are lossy and Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches may be more suitable.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

challenges, and demonstrates the potential of Chat-of-Thought in addressing
these challenges through interactive, template-driven workflows and
context-aware agent collaboration.

*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigate the impact of prompt variance on large language models' responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure behavioral drift in LLMs under semantically equivalent prompt rewordings.

Method: Propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) as a diagnostic framework.

Result: Consistent, model-specific response shifts are found, linked to tokenization and decoding.

Conclusion: Highlight overlooked dimensions of model evaluation stability and suggest potential causes for post-training quality of service instability.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven novel two-stage framework for enabling precise, interpretable reasoning over charts. Experimental results show its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: How to extend the capability of large language models to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing multimodal reasoning approaches often lose critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations, especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount of visual details.

Method: Propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning over charts. First, train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart images into structured ECharts codes. Then, design a general chart reasoning data synthesis pipeline to automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories.

Result: Experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner.

Conclusion: It can preserve the original details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

### [7] [Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139)
*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel unsupervised algorithm called Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) for fine-tuning pretrained language models using their own generated labels without external supervision. The method shows competitive performance compared to golden supervision and surpasses crowdsourced human supervision on several tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty or impossibility of obtaining high-quality human supervision for models with superhuman capabilities.

Method: Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) which fine-tunes pretrained language models on their own generated labels.

Result: On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks, ICM matches golden supervision performance and outperforms crowdsourced human supervision. It also elicits superhuman capabilities better than human labels on certain tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates that unsupervised fine-tuning can enhance the performance of language models, even surpassing human-supervised methods in some cases.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can judge the nuances of empathic communication reliably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reliably large language models (LLMs) judge the nuances of empathic communication.

Method: Comparing expert, crowdworker, and LLM annotations across four evaluative frameworks applied to 200 real-world conversations.

Result: LLMs consistently approach expert-level agreement and exceed the reliability of crowdworkers.

Conclusion: When validated on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, LLMs can support transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

TL;DR: This study explores emotion analysis in Bangla using multiple machine learning models on social media comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance sentiment analysis in languages with limited resources like Bangla.

Method: Using Linear SVM, KNN, Random Forest with n-gram data from TF-IDF vectorizer, PCA for dimensionality reduction, BiLSTM model, and AdaBoost to improve decision trees.

Result: Various techniques were examined to find efficient methods for emotion identification in Bangla.

Conclusion: The research contributes to understanding emotions in written language particularly for understudied languages with unique cultural features.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

TL;DR: This paper develops a machine learning-based lexicon for human capital disclosures, providing tools and examples for researchers to explore pertinent HC questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of well-defined measurement or disclosure rules for human capital (HC), which is crucial for corporate value creation.

Method: A machine learning algorithm called word2vec is trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to create a comprehensive list of HC-related keywords categorized into five subcategories.

Result: The result is a lexicon of HC-related keywords, corporate HC disclosures, and Python code used to develop the lexicon, along with examples of how to use the data and code.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by discussing future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [11] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigate LLMs' ability to solve narrative planning problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLMs' capability in producing high-quality stories.

Method: Use narrative planning based on literature examples.

Result: GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales but struggle with character intentionality and dramatic conflict.

Conclusion: This work deepens our understanding of LLMs' story generation abilities and provides insights for applying LLMs in game environments.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work introduces Q2E, a novel method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval that enhances event understanding by decomposing queries with knowledge from LLMs and VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve video retrieval related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge.

Method: Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. It uses entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion.

Result: Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics. Integrating audio information significantly improves text-to-video retrieval.

Conclusion: Q2E demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs and VLMs knowledge in enhancing video retrieval for complex real-world events.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

TL;DR: 提出TTT-Bench基准测试，评估大型推理模型的基本战略、空间和逻辑推理能力，发现擅长解决复杂数学问题的模型在此类简单推理任务中表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的许多推理基准测试都集中在STEM领域，而大型推理模型在更广泛任务领域的推理能力尚未得到充分探索。因此，研究者们引入了TTT-Bench基准测试来评估这些模型的基本战略、空间和逻辑推理能力。

Method: 使用了一种简单且可扩展的程序化方法来生成TTT-Bench基准测试中的可验证双人游戏问题。

Result: 发现擅长解决困难数学问题的模型在这些简单的推理游戏中经常失败，并且在TTT-Bench上的得分比MATH 500和AIME 2024分别低41%和5%。

Conclusion: 大推理模型在解决复杂数学问题上表现出色，但在基本的战略、空间和逻辑推理能力上却表现不佳。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using computational methods to identify unreliable narrators in texts from multiple domains. A human-annotated dataset named TUNa is introduced and classification tasks are defined for different types of unreliabilities. The performance of various LLMs is analyzed and potential ways to improve identification are explored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop computational methods to identify unreliable narrators, especially those who unintentionally misrepresent information.

Method: Borrow literary theory from narratology to define types of unreliable narrators, create a human-annotated dataset TUNa, and experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning settings.

Result: Identifying unreliable narrators is very challenging, but LLMs show potential in performing this task.

Conclusion: Release the expert-annotated dataset and code, and encourage future research in this area.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

*Iago Alves Brito,Julia Soares Dollis,Fernanda Bufon Färber,Diogo Fernandes Costa Silva,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToxSyn-PT is a new Portuguese corpus for fine-grained hate-speech classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Portuguese datasets are dominated by social-media domains and lack a large-scale corpus for fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority groups.

Method: Creating a novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and (4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to group-specific cues.

Result: Experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries.

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT is a newly created Portuguese corpus that has strong generalization capabilities and can be used for hate-speech detection research.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

### [16] [Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268)
*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether language models exhibit Bayesian-like reasoning by analyzing their decision-making patterns through Gibbs sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions and to investigate the conditions under which they exhibit deterministic behavior.

Method: The authors use simulated Gibbs sampling to analyze the decision patterns of large language models.

Result: They found that under certain conditions, language models can produce near-deterministic decisions, such as maximum likelihood estimations, even at non-zero sampling temperatures.

Conclusion: The study suggests that care must be taken when interpreting simulated Gibbs sampling results to avoid inferring misleading language model priors.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

### [17] [ClusterUCB: Efficient Gradient-Based Data Selection for Targeted Fine-Tuning of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10288)
*Zige Wang,Qi Zhu,Fei Mi,Minghui Xu,Ruochun Jin,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient gradient-based data selection framework named ClusterUCB that uses clustering and a modified UCB algorithm for selecting useful data samples in large language model fine-tuning, achieving comparable results to original methods but with significantly reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based data influence approximation is used for data sample selection in supervised fine-tuning of large language models, but its computation is resource-intensive and not practical.

Method: ClusterUCB applies clustering on the training data pool and frames inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation problem, modeled as a multi-armed bandit problem solved by a modified UCB algorithm. Historical data influence information is used to estimate cluster distributions and a cold start balances exploration and exploitation.

Result: Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that ClusterUCB achieves comparable results to original gradient-based methods while greatly reducing computing consumption.

Conclusion: ClusterUCB provides an efficient way for data sample selection in large language model fine-tuning, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [18] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Train deep learning models with limited labeled data has been widely studied. This paper proposes Flick, a method to improve pseudo-label quality for few-label text classification, especially in low-resource linguistic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on extensive labeled data and improve performance in low-resource settings.

Method: Leverage high-confidence pseudo-labels from an initial broad set of clusters using a novel pseudo-label refinement component.

Result: Flick shows better performance than other methods on 14 diverse datasets including challenging low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Flick improves pseudo-label quality and enables robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with few true labels.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the impact of user-provided suggestions on LLMs within an educational context, revealing significant variations in response quality and sycophantic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how sycophantic tendencies in LLMs affect their performance and educational equity when students provide incorrect or correct answers.

Method: Testing five different LLMs from OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions focusing on query framing.

Result: Response quality varies significantly depending on query framing; incorrect answers degrade accuracy by up to 15%, while correct ones boost it similarly. Smaller models exhibit stronger biases (up to 30%) compared to larger ones (8%). Analysis confirms models change answers based on student input, aligning with the sycophancy hypothesis.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating sycophantic biases in LLMs to ensure fair and equitable educational outcomes.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

*Hayato Futami,Emiru Tsunoo,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Yuki Ito,Hassan Shahmohammadi,Siddhant Arora,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposed a new training method for speech-to-speech translation using large language models, improving translation performance especially for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting large language models trained on text-only data to speech modality with limited speech-to-speech data.

Method: Scheduled interleaved speech-text training using interleaved speech-text units and gradually decreasing the ratio of text as training progresses.

Result: Consistent improvement in translation performance, particularly beneficial for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves translation performance, especially for languages with limited training data.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Motivation: Obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision for training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision remains a significant challenge.

Method: Extract verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transform them into natural language CoT reasoning.

Result: Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that the method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TableRAG的新框架，用于增强异构文档问答中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG方法在处理包含文本和表格组件的异构文档时表现出关键限制。常见的表格展平和分块策略会破坏固有的表格结构，导致信息丢失，并削弱LLMs在多跳全局查询中的推理能力。

Method: TableRAG迭代地在四个步骤中操作：上下文敏感的查询分解，文本检索，SQL编程和执行，以及组成中间答案生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，TableRAG在公共数据集和HeteQA上都优于现有基线，为异构文档问答建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: TableRAG在公共数据集和HeteQA上始终优于现有基线，为异构文档问答建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAG is a new framework that allows large language models to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to reliably verify the correctness of their own outputs.

Method: Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG) framework.

Result: PAG's dual advancements: enhances direct generation and self-correction accuracy; outperforms self-consistency as a verifier.

Conclusion: PAG framework improves both reasoning and verification abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Motivation: To assess the temporal grounding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.

Method: Introduces TempVS benchmark with three main tests and basic grounding tests.

Result: Most state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle to solve TempVS and have a significant performance gap compared to humans.

Conclusion: The study provides fine-grained insights for future research directions and makes TempVS data and code publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how different news outlets frame the Israel-Palestine conflict, revealing a stronger emphasis on war rather than peace journalism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of media framing on public opinion during conflicts and improve upon previous qualitative research.

Method: Using computational approaches that combine frame semantics with large language models to analyze news articles.

Result: US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets exhibit different focuses in their conflict reporting, particularly differing in their portrayal of assailants and victims.

Conclusion: Media framing significantly influences reader opinions and can exacerbate conflicts; differences in reporting highlight underlying biases.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

TL;DR: We introduce a new method to make large language models reason more efficiently by adjusting rewards based on problem complexity and output length, showing improvements in accuracy and efficiency across several datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's overall performance

Method: dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output length

Result: For the comparatively simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024 dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024

*Xanh Ho,Sunisth Kumar,Yun-Ang Wu,Florian Boudin,Atsuhiro Takasu,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new dataset and method for verifying scientific claims using tables, focusing on improving model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the interpretability of models in scientific claim verification tasks.

Method: Reframing table-text alignment as an explanation task where models must identify key table cells supporting claim verification.

Result: Improved claim verification performance when incorporating table alignment information.

Conclusion: Most large language models predict correct labels but fail to recover human-aligned rationales, indicating their predictions may not be based on faithful reasoning.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates bias in large language models (LLMs) using various proxy measures. It finds that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark leads to negligible differences in scores. However, asking a model to grade the user's answer shows more significant signs of bias. Asking the model for salary negotiation advice reveals pronounced bias in the answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate biases in large language models due to the controversial and stereotypical content in training data, which can lead to biased viewpoints or results based on the assigned or user's personality.

Method: The authors use various proxy measures to evaluate bias in large language models. They test models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark, ask models to grade user's answers, and request models for salary negotiation advice.

Result: Evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores. Grading user's answers shows more significant signs of bias. Salary negotiation advice reveals pronounced bias in the answers.

Conclusion: The study highlights the issue of bias in large language models and suggests that as LLM assistants gain memory and personalization capabilities, these biases could become more prominent.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

TL;DR: This study examines the performance of large language models in multi-user dialogue state tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DST benchmarks mainly focus on structured user-agent conversations, ignoring the complexity of real-world multi-user interactions.

Method: The researchers extended an existing DST dataset by generating the second user's utterances based on speech act theory.

Result: The experimental results showed a significant decrease in performance compared to single-user DST, indicating the limitations of current LLMs in handling multiple speakers.

Conclusion: Future research is needed to improve LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RRP, a framework that combines semantic strengths of large language models with structural information from knowledge graphs to refine and organize facts into logically consistent reasoning paths, improving reasoning abilities of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models in knowledge-intensive tasks due to lack of background knowledge and tendency to hallucinate, and to improve their ability to solve complex questions by refining relationships among facts.

Method: Proposes RRP framework that uses relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning to extract reliable reasoning paths from knowledge graphs, along with a rethinking module to evaluate and refine these paths.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: RRP effectively generates high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions, providing effective guidance for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: We propose a new method for reconstructing ancestral word forms without using supervised learning. This method combines data-driven inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization framework, showing better performance than previous methods when tested on reconstructing Latin protoforms from five Romance languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective method for reconstructing ancestral word forms that can overcome limitations of purely data-driven approaches.

Method: An unsupervised method integrating data-driven inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization framework.

Result: The proposed method shows significant improvement over existing baselines in terms of character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility when reconstructing Latin protoforms using cognates from five Romance languages.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of combining data-driven and rule-based approaches in the reconstruction of ancestral word forms.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Method: Four different approaches including machine learning models, frozen sentence-transformer, history-aware model, and retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with GPT-4o.

Result: The final system which combines example-driven prompting with a large language model outperforms all baselines.

Conclusion: Combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning is effective for pedagogical feedback assessment.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how large language models internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens.

Method: We investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process.

Result: The embedding layer does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the first character. LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge.

Conclusion: Our analysis reveals that LLMs do not handle the spelling-out process straightforwardly. Instead, they rely on higher layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

TL;DR: 本研究展示了大型语言模型在生命威胁性语言检测方面的巨大潜力，特别是在处理不平衡数据时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文旨在利用大型语言模型来识别生命威胁性文本，以保护处于困境中的个人，促进心理健康和福祉，并防止潜在的危害和生命损失。

Method: 研究通过微调三个开源大型语言模型（Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2）的7B参数变体，并与传统的词袋、词嵌入、主题建模和双向编码表示从变换器的方法进行了比较。

Result: 实验结果显示大型语言模型的表现优于传统方法，在处理平衡和不平衡数据时，Mistral和Llama-2模型表现最佳，而Gemma略逊一筹。此外，尽管上采样技术对传统方法有益，但它对大型语言模型的影响不大。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明大型语言模型在生命威胁性语言检测方面表现强劲，尤其是在平衡和不平衡数据场景下，Mistral和Llama-2模型表现最佳。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Motivation: To address the issue of missing links in Open English Wordnet, especially focusing on establishing hypernymy between adjectives.

Method: Presenting a theoretical discussion on the hypernymy relation for adjectives compared to nouns and verbs. Developing a new resource for adjective hypernymy and fine-tuning large language models (TaxoLLaMa) to predict adjective hypernymy.

Result: Successfully established a method to predict adjective hypernymy by adapting the TaxoLLaMa methodology.

### [37] [PREMISE: Scalable and Strategic Prompt Optimization for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning in Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10716)
*Ye Yu,Yaoning Yu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMISE reduces reasoning tokens and cost for LRMs while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LRMs have strong performance on math benchmarks but their CoT reasoning is often verbose, increasing token usage and cost.

Method: PREMISE uses trace-level diagnostics and gradient-inspired prompt optimization to optimize brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search.

Result: On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500, PREMISE matches or exceeds baseline accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% and cutting dollar cost by 69--82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable way to make LRMs more efficient without sacrificing reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

### [38] [Beyond True or False: Retrieval-Augmented Hierarchical Analysis of Nuanced Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10728)
*Priyanka Kargupta,Runchu Tian,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ClaimSpect, a framework that breaks down complex claims into hierarchical aspects and sub-aspects for validation and representation of different perspectives using a retrieval-augmented generation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and nuance of claims which cannot be simply categorized as true or false, especially in scientific and political contexts.

Method: Developing a retrieval-augmented generation-based framework called ClaimSpect to construct a hierarchy of aspects related to a claim and retrieve relevant information from a corpus to enrich these aspects with specific perspectives.

Result: ClaimSpect effectively deconstructs complex claims and represents various perspectives within a corpus, showing robustness and accuracy when applied to real-world scientific and political claims.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a structured way to analyze claims, allowing readers to focus on specific aspects of interest and understand the prevalence of different viewpoints.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

*Priyanka Kargupta,Nan Zhang,Yunyi Zhang,Rui Zhang,Prasenjit Mitra,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt is a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizing and retrieving scientific literature is challenging due to the rapid evolution of scientific fields. Expert-curated taxonomies are time-consuming and expensive while automatic methods either over-rely on a specific corpus or depend heavily on the general knowledge of large language models.

Method: TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus' topical distribution.

Result: TaxoAdapt demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of computer science conferences over the years.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are more granularity-preserving and coherent than the most competitive baselines.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how to enhance the 'language plasticity' of large language models through a universal tokenizer, which improves adaptation capabilities to new languages post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of pretraining LLMs for many languages simultaneously due to limited model capacity, scarce high-quality data, and compute constraints, especially considering the lack of language coverage of the tokenizer.

Method: Using a universal tokenizer trained for more languages than the primary pretraining languages.

Result: The proposed method shows significant improvement in language adaptation, with up to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining languages, and up to 5% win rate gain towards completely unseen languages.

Conclusion: A universal tokenizer improves the model's ability to adapt to new languages post-training.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

Conclusion: Select models based on the nature of the question and model-specific strengths.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using a large language model to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions, reducing the word error rate of named entities significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entities often being the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream applications.

Method: A large language model revision mechanism is introduced to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions.

Result: Our proposed technique achieves up to 30% relative WER reduction for named entities.

Conclusion: The proposed technique reduces up to 30% of the relative WER for named entities.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Wei Sun,Tingyu Qu,Mingxiao Li,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method called LangEdit is proposed to solve the problem of updating multilingual knowledge in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating multilingual knowledge in large language models while maintaining consistent factual representations across languages is challenging and costly.

Method: LangEdit uses a null-space constrained framework to isolate language-specific knowledge updates by projecting parameter updates onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.

Result: LangEdit outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods in mitigating parameter interference and improving multilingual generalization and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed LangEdit method can enable efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in large language models.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: ReCUT is a novel method that balances the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory by employing a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches attempt to mitigate the issue of overthinking in CoT prompting through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and prone to overfitting.

Method: ReCUT employs a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy, enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the parameters of these two models.

Result: Experimental results across multiple math reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines.

Conclusion: ReCUT significantly reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel dynamic sampling strategy called SlowFast Sampling is proposed for diffusion-based language models (dLLMs), which achieves significant speedup while maintaining minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for dLLMs often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility.

Method: SlowFast Sampling alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages guided by certainty, convergence, and positional principles, and it's integrated with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.

Result: SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop and up to 34.22× when combined with caching.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines in throughput, showing that well-designed sampling can fully realize the potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech.

Method: Probing classifiers and geometric analyses are used to examine how phones, lexical tones, and speaker information are represented.

Result: For all pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, and layerwise patterns of probing accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers.

Conclusion: The structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Motivation: Existing medical dialogue systems face challenges in identifying relevant medical knowledge and generating personalized, medically accurate responses.

Method: MedRef uses a knowledge refining mechanism and a comprehensive prompt structure with historical and evident details. It also includes Triplet Filter and Demo Selector modules for real-time adaptability.

Result: MedRef surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in generation quality and medical entity accuracy according to experiments on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedRef demonstrates effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its

Conclusion: The study offers theoretical insights and practical guidance for implementing efficient LLM adaptation.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large
language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and
QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1)
commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3)
multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve
task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2)
performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can both generalize and hallucinate due to out-of-context reasoning (OCR). This study explores OCR's mechanism and demonstrates it can be learned by transformers with factorized matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why LLMs can generalize well but also hallucinate when fine-tuned.

Method: Experiments on five prominent LLMs and theoretical analysis using a synthetic factual recall task.

Result: OCR drives both generalization and hallucination in LLMs, and it can be learned by transformers with factorized output and value matrices.

Conclusion: OCR phenomenon is explained by the implicit bias of gradient descent favoring low nuclear norm solutions, providing a theoretical foundation for knowledge injection behaviors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited domain adaptation in biomedical and clinical NLP due to slower development of encoders.

Method: Introduces BioClinical ModernBERT, which is domain-adapted and built on ModernBERT with improvements in speed and performance. Pretrained on a large biomedical and clinical corpus and multiple datasets.

Result: Outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on four downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Releases both base and large versions of BioClinical ModernBERT along with training checkpoints for further research.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for evaluating autoformalization tasks using an ensemble of LLM judges with specific criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating autoformalization tasks are limited in their effectiveness for advanced formal mathematical reasoning due to coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria.

Method: The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality.

Result: The EFG ensemble of LLM judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing formal qualities.

Conclusion: This work suggests that LLM-as-judges, especially when guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable, interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

Result: 在Llama 3.1、Gemma 2和GPT-2上的实验表明，SNMF得到的特征在因果引导任务上优于稀疏自编码器和强监督基线。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单而有效的工具，用于识别大型语言模型中的可解释特征并剖析概念表示。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

*Timothy Obiso,Kenneth Lai,Abhijnan Nath,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,James Pustejovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the concept of 'epistemic friction' in aligning large language models with human preferences, proposing a model that predicts belief updates in dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the oversight of epistemic friction in existing approaches for aligning large language models with human preferences.

Method: Defining dynamic epistemic friction within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic and analyzing its role in belief revision during interactions.

Result: The proposed model effectively predicts belief updates in dialogues and can be made more sophisticated to handle real-world dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: Understanding and accounting for epistemic friction is crucial for improving the alignment of large language models with human preferences.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

Motivation: 为了在语言模型预训练过程中找到最佳的数据混合，同时提高方法的效率和可扩展性。

Method: 将数据集分解为几个元域(meta-domains)的线性组合，并使用分类器生成对应于元域词汇表分布的域向量。

Result: 在Pile-CC上，仅使用原Pile数据集混合训练所需计算资源的51.5%，即可达到相同的验证损失；在相同计算预算下，下游任务性能平均提升2.83%。

Conclusion: 提出了Domain2Vec方法，通过分布对齐假设(DA^2)，有效减少计算开销并提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated

However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in

Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven data science agents have limitations in handling complex, innovative tasks due to rigid workflows and inflexible coding strategies.

Method: AutoMind uses a curated expert knowledge base, agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and self-adaptive coding strategy to overcome these limitations.

Result: Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks show that AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a significant advance towards fully automated data science with its adaptive and knowledgeable approach.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

Conclusion: Highlighted key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges in discrete audio tokenization, providing guidance for future research.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing

reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,

TL;DR: Integrating audio perception capabilities into large language models (Audio-LLMs) has seen rapid application-focused developments, but underlying mechanisms for efficient semantic representation transfer remain under-explored. This paper systematically investigates how architectural design choices impact this process. By modifying a standard audio-LLM architecture based on hypotheses from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles, the research demonstrates three key findings: delaying audio integration enhances probing ability, exclusive use of attention submodules suffices for proficient probing, and ensembling diverse audio encoders broadens information probing capacity. These modifications collectively improve performance by 10%-60% over the baseline.


<details>

Motivation: To explore the underlying mechanisms governing efficient transfer of rich semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs in Audio-LLMs.

Method: Systematically investigates the impact of architectural design choices on Audio-LLM interaction, proposing and evaluating modifications to a standard architecture guided by mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles.

Result: Demonstrates three key findings: delaying audio integration enhances probing ability, exclusive use of attention submodules suffices for proficient probing, and ensembling diverse audio encoders broadens information probing capacity. Achieves relative improvements from 10% to 60% over the baseline.

Conclusion: Optimizing cross-modal information transfer in Audio-LLMs through proposed architectural modifications leads to significant performance gains.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

TL;DR: Medical foundation models can summarize clinical notes, answer questions and assist in decision-making, but adapting them is often impractical and limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs.

Motivation: To address the limitations of current medical foundation models in adapting to new situations and avoiding contextual errors by enabling dynamic adjustment of their behavior.

Method: Outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI, focusing on models that can dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining.

Result: N/A

Conclusion: The proposed context-switching models could potentially diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and regions, improving access to medical care.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current scientific benchmarks mainly assess knowledge understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), neglecting their perception and reasoning abilities. This paper introduces Scientists' First Exam (SFE), a benchmark evaluating MLLMs' scientific cognitive capacities via three levels: signal perception, attribute understanding, and comparative reasoning. Across five disciplines, SFE includes 830 expert-verified VQA pairs. Prominent models like GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 score only 34.08% and 26.52%, respectively, indicating substantial room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark that evaluates the perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs in scientific contexts beyond just knowledge understanding.

Method: Developed Scientists' First Exam (SFE), consisting of 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types and 66 tasks in five disciplines.

Result: State-of-the-art models GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 scored 34.08% and 26.52%, respectively, on SFE, showing that MLLMs need significant improvement in scientific domains.

Conclusion: The SFE benchmark provides a new way to evaluate MLLMs' scientific cognitive capacities, with the aim of advancing AI-assisted scientific discovery.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset for evaluating Large Language Models in solving mathematical problems in the telecommunications domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of LLMs in specialized domains like signal processing and network optimization.

Method: Developing a benchmark dataset called TeleMath with 500 QnA pairs and evaluating various open-source LLMs.

Result: Recent models designed for mathematical or logical reasoning perform better on TeleMath than general-purpose models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of domain-specific datasets for evaluating LLMs and supports future research in this area.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Conclusion: 尽管当前的多模态大型语言模型在分子毒性修复任务上仍面临重大挑战，但它们开始展示出在毒性理解、语义约束遵守和结构感知分子编辑方面的有希望的能力。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an audio comprehension model using large language models' dialogue continuation abilities, solving the caption variation problem and enabling zero-shot instruction-following without multitask tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the caption variation problem and enable zero-shot instruction-following capabilities in audio comprehension models.

Method: Training a model to produce dialogue responses instead of direct captions, leveraging the dialogue continuation ability of large language models.

Result: The model demonstrates strong performance on unseen instructions across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures the meaning of captions and achieves zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask tuning.

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to make speech recognizer adaptation robust with very limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognisers perform optimally only in a specific environment and need to be adapted to work well in another. However, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that data is usually unlabelled.

Method: Combination of novel loss function (conditional entropy over complete hypotheses) and speaker code characterisation.

Result: A 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme improves word error rate by 20% relatively on one minute of adaptation data and increases to 29% on 10 minutes.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

TL;DR: This report defines an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value lambda-calculus in the pi-calculus, proves its soundness and completeness, and compares it to Milners encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a specialized encoding of Levys call-by-push-value lambda-calculus in the pi-calculus that is both sound and complete, and to compare it to existing encodings.

Method: The report uses an internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to encode Levys call-by-push-value lambda-calculus and provides informal proofs of soundness, completeness, and all required lemmas. It also begins a formalization of the proof in Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.

Result: The encoding is shown to be sound and complete, and it coincides with early-, late- and open-bisimulation, which is a congruence. The report argues that the encoding satisfies Gorlas criteria for good encodings and shows similarities between Milners and the new encoding. Encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus are presented.

Conclusion: This paper presents an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value lambda-calculus in the pi-calculus that is sound and complete, and compares it to Milners encoding.

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Develops RAAI, a simple method to generate harmful synthetic data for aligning large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning large language models require costly human-labeled data or complex models. Synthetic data could be a cheaper alternative but existing methods have limitations.

Method: Introduces Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), which uses internal refusal signals to inject predefined phrases to produce harmful outputs.

Result: Experiments show RAAI increases harmful response rates from 2.15% to up to 61.04%. Fine-tuning with RAAI-generated data improves model robustness against harmful prompts while maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: Shows how LLM attack techniques can be used as practical tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

TL;DR: An approach called Private Memorization Editing (PME) is introduced to prevent private data leakage from Large Language Models (LLMs) by turning their memorization ability into a privacy defense strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs potentially memorizing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from uncontrolled data, which could lead to privacy breaches.

Method: Detecting memorized PII and mitigating the memorization by editing the model's knowledge of its training data.

Result: The procedure does not affect the language model's performance while making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. PME effectively reduces the number of leaked PII in various configurations.

Conclusion: Private Memorization Editing can be an effective strategy to protect against private data leakage from LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion can be misused to create harmful content, posing safety risks. Existing content moderation systems and research on red-teaming have limitations. A new framework called GenBreak is proposed to evaluate the safety of defended T2I models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety risks posed by misuse of text-to-image models and the limitations in current evaluation methods.

Method: GenBreak fine-tunes a red-team large language model using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to generate adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and image toxicity.

Result: The generated adversarial prompts show strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against commercial T2I generators, uncovering practical and concerning safety weaknesses.

Conclusion: GenBreak provides a reliable tool for evaluating the safety of defended text-to-image models.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concern about unauthorized disclosures due to continuous access to sensitive data by large language model agents

Method: Iterative probing strategy to stress-test agents enforcing strict privacy directives

Result: The evaluation demonstrates CMPL's ability to reveal privacy risks not deterred by existing single-turn defenses

Conclusion: The study introduces CMPL, a framework for auditing conversational privacy in large language model agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Some machine unlearning methods might fail under simple prompt attacks. Eight unlearning techniques were evaluated, revealing that while methods such as RMU and TAR are robust, ELM remains vulnerable to certain prompt attacks. Logit analysis shows unlearned models don't hide knowledge by altering answer formatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the effectiveness of different machine unlearning methods against prompt attacks.

Method: Systematically evaluating eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis.

Result: Methods like RMU and TAR demonstrate robust unlearning, but ELM is still vulnerable to specific prompt attacks. Unlearned models generally do not hide knowledge by changing how answers are formatted.

Conclusion: The study challenges assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and emphasizes the necessity for reliable evaluation frameworks to differentiate between actual knowledge removal and superficial output suppression.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

### [78] [FASCIST-O-METER: Classifier for Neo-fascist Discourse Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10789)
*Rudy Alexandro Garrido Veliz,Martin Semmann,Chris Biemann,Seid Muhie Yimam*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel neo-fascist coding scheme for digital discourse in the US societal context, bridging NLP and political science. It collects internet activity from neo-fascist groups, annotates posts, and fine-tunes language models to classify neo-fascist discourse, finding it prevalent in such forums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing threat of neo-fascism to democracy and minorities by developing a method to detect neo-fascist rhetoric in digital discourse.

Method: Developing a neo-fascist coding scheme, collecting internet activity from neo-fascist forums, annotating posts through crowdsourcing, and fine-tuning both Small and Large Language Models using the labeled dataset.

Result: The prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric is found to be constant in the studied forums, and the first classification models for neo-fascist discourse are created.

Conclusion: The societal context is crucial for NLP research on neo-fascist speech, and ongoing efforts are necessary to combat this political movement for the sake of democracy.

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态情感识别框架CIDer，包括MSSD和MACI两个模块，用于解决模态缺失和OOD数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态情感识别方法在处理模态缺失和OOD数据时存在局限性，需要特定模型或引入过多参数。

Method: CIDer框架包含MSSD模块通过自蒸馏增强鲁棒性，以及MACI模块通过因果图减轻标签和语言偏差。

Result: CIDer在RMFM和OOD场景下表现优异，参数更少且训练更快。

Conclusion: 所提出的CIDer框架为多模态情感识别提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

*Huaying Yuan,Zheng Liu,Junjie Zhou,Ji-Rong Wen,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work introduces VideoDeepResearch, an agent-based framework for long video understanding that only requires a text-only large reasoning model and a modular multi-modal toolkit. The method shows superior performance compared to previous MLLM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent complexity of long video understanding tasks and the context window constraint present significant challenges for current multi-modal large language models.

Method: An agent-based framework named VideoDeepResearch is proposed, which uses a text-only large reasoning model combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers.

Result: VideoDeepResearch outperforms existing MLLM baselines on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9%, respectively.

Conclusion: Agent-based systems hold great potential for overcoming challenges in long video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to learn in-context image editing from videos using a block-causal diffusion transformer and achieves strong performance in various image editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for in-context image editing depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models, which may limit their flexibility and applicability.

Method: A scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences and a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks.

Result: The model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. It also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of learning in-context image editing models directly from videos without relying on task-specific pipelines or expert models.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces knowledge image generation as a new task and proposes the MMMG benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of image generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reasoning capabilities of image generation models using knowledge images which are essential for human civilization and learning.

Method: Introduce knowledge image generation task and create the MMMG benchmark with 4,456 expert-validated image-prompt pairs across 10 disciplines.

Result: Found serious reasoning deficits in 16 state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4o scoring 50.20 on MMMG-Score.

Conclusion: Released FLUX-Reason, an open baseline model with a score of 34.45 on MMMG-Score, to encourage further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

*Shangpin Peng,Weinong Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Senqiao Yang,Xing Wu,Haotian Xu,Chengquan Zhang,Takashi Isobe,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO enhances reinforcement learning from human feedback by optimizing preference pairs' quality and model's learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO-based approaches ignore variations in the inherent quality and learning utility of preference pairs, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: Adaptive weighting of preference pairs based on data quality and model's learning dynamics.

Result: Omni-DPO shows superior performance and generalization capabilities on various models and benchmarks, outperforming leading models on textual understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework, improves the performance and data utilization in RLHF.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a meta-learning approach to detect sockpuppets on Wikipedia more accurately, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving access to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of disinformation by detecting malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia.

Method: Applying meta-learning to optimize a model for rapid adaptation to the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group.

Result: Meta-learning outperforms pre-trained models in predicting sockpuppets, particularly when text data is limited.

Conclusion: Meta-learning significantly improves the precision of predictions for detecting sockpuppets on Wikipedia compared to pre-trained models.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

TL;DR: 本文定义了从语言反馈中学习的问题，提出了解决方案，并展示了其在几个经验领域的良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前从观察和语言反馈中进行交互式学习是一个日益受到关注的研究领域，特别是随着大型语言模型（LLM）代理的出现。尽管已经展示了令人印象深刻的实证演示，但到目前为止，这些决策问题的原则性框架仍然缺乏。

Method: 本文正式定义了从语言反馈中学习（LLF）的问题，提出了足够的假设以在潜在奖励的情况下实现学习，并引入“转移探索维度”作为表征LLF问题难度的复杂度度量。

Result: 我们展示了转移探索维度捕捉到了反馈中的信息如何改变LLF问题的学习复杂性的直觉。我们证明了从丰富的语言反馈中学习可以比从奖励中学习快指数倍。我们开发了一种称为`HELiX`的无悔算法，该算法通过顺序交互解决了LLF问题，并且其性能保证与问题的转移探索维度成比例。

Conclusion: 我们的贡献标志着朝着设计从通用语言反馈中进行原则性交互学习算法迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在微调时是否具有与判别模型和生成模型类似的属性推理漏洞。

Method: 引入PropInfer基准任务评估大型语言模型的属性推理，并提出提示生成攻击和基于词频信号的影子模型攻击。

Result: 通过实证评估，展示了所提出的两种攻击方法的成功率，揭示了大型语言模型的属性推理漏洞。

Conclusion: 揭示了大型语言模型在微调过程中存在先前未被认识的属性推理漏洞。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的因果表示学习框架来评估语言模型的能力，发现了一个三节点线性因果结构，揭示了从通用问题解决能力到数学推理能力的因果路径。


<details>

Motivation: 对语言模型能力的忠实评估对于得出可操作的见解以指导模型开发至关重要。然而，在这个领域进行严格的因果评估面临着显著的方法论挑战，包括复杂的混杂效应和与广泛重新训练相关的高计算成本。

Method: 我们提出了一个因果表示学习框架，其中观测基准性能被建模为少数潜在能力因素的线性变换。通过适当地控制基础模型作为共同混杂因子后，这些潜在因素被识别为因果相关。应用此方法于包含超过1500个模型的数据集上，这些模型在开放LLM排行榜的六个基准上进行了评估。

Result: 应用提出的因果表示学习框架，我们确定了一个简洁的三节点线性因果结构，可靠地解释了观察到的性能变化。这个结构揭示了从通用问题解决能力到数学推理能力的明确因果方向。

Conclusion: 我们确定了一个简洁的三节点线性因果结构，可靠地解释了观察到的性能变化。对这个因果结构的进一步解释提供了超越简单数值排名的重要科学见解：具体来说，我们揭示了一个明确的因果方向，从通用问题解决能力开始，通过指令跟随熟练度，最终达到数学推理能力。我们的结果强调了在评估过程中仔细控制基础模型变化的重要性，这是准确揭示潜在模型能力之间因果关系的关键步骤。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks do not reflect real-world time series data characteristics, leading to a gap between research and application. Time-IMM aims to address this by providing a more realistic dataset.

Method: Time-IMM introduces nine types of irregularity categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. IMM-TSF includes fusion modules for asynchronous integration.

Result: Empirical results show that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data improves forecasting performance.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a practical foundation for time series analysis under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients through precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited supervision.

Method: Decoupling the task into two stages: sentence-level evidence identification and answer synthesis with explicit citations, and using DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer to jointly tune instructions and few-shot demonstrations.

bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

TL;DR: Duo enhances uniform-state discrete diffusion models by applying techniques from Gaussian diffusion, resulting in faster training and sampling for better text generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the performance gap between uniform-state discrete diffusion models and other types of models by utilizing techniques from Gaussian diffusion.

Method: Duo introduces curriculum learning guided by the Gaussian process to enhance training and Discrete Consistency Distillation to accelerate sampling in diffusion language models.

Result: Models trained using Duo's curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks and the introduced algorithm enables few-step generation in diffusion language models by significantly speeding up sampling.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Duo, a method that bridges the performance gap between uniform-state discrete diffusion models and other models like autoregressive models and masked diffusion models by leveraging insights from Gaussian diffusion.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: Internal bias mitigation reduces racial and gender biases in large language models across various realistic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failures of simple anti-bias prompts in eliminating demographic biases in realistic contexts.

Method: Identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions within model activations.

Result: Internal bias mitigation achieves robust bias reduction across all tested scenarios and models.

Conclusion: Adding realistic context to large language models induces significant racial and gender biases, which can be effectively mitigated through internal bias mitigation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

### [94] [GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946)
*Evelyn Ma,Duo Zhou,Peizhi Niu,Huiting Zhou,Huan Zhang,Olgica Milenkovic,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method called GUARD is proposed to improve the retention of valuable information during the unlearning process in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of unlearning in LLMs due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns, as well as the issue of unintended forgetting.

Method: GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric and a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning.

Conclusion: GUARD effectively reduces unintended losses in retention and enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

*Xing Han Lù,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper argues for a new approach in web agent research by proposing the concept of Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) that are specifically designed for autonomous AI systems rather than human interfaces. The authors provide six guiding principles for AWI design to ensure safety, efficiency, and standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the challenge posed by the mismatch between human-designed web interfaces and the capabilities of large language models in creating effective web agents.

Method: The method involves introducing the concept of Agentic Web Interfaces and establishing six guiding principles for their design.

Result: The result is a proposed paradigm shift in web agent research that could lead to more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agents.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for a collaborative effort in the ML community to develop interfaces optimized for agentic capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.
