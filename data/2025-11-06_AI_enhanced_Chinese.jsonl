As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and\nvision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.\nThis shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D\nscenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address\nthis, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse\ntools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate\nalignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed\ninstructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world\nenvironments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge\nby 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment.

We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and\nweight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask\nfine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling\n1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark\nresults with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first\npublic set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in\nlow-resource domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u8bbaABSA\u8d44\u6e90\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dABSA\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u9700\u6c42\u4f46\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8eABSA\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aFTS-OBP\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5c0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FTS-OBP\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u63d0\u53d6\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u5c0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528200-1000\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u8bbaABSA\u8d44\u6e90\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u8d21\u732e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u4e2dABSA\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5bf9\u5c0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d1\u5e03\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u8bbaABSA\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC\n(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded\nbenchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three\nfundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and\nknowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'\ncognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct\nextensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that\nclosed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.\n30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak\n(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,\nincluding orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and\npoor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that\nChain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->\nverify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction.

To address this, we introduce BengaliMoralBench, the\nfirst large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural\ncontexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting,\nFamily Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally\nrelevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus\nusing three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct\nsystematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including\nLlama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and\nstandard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative\nanalysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense\nreasoning, and moral fairness.

While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT\nmetrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled\nevaluation methodologies for speech translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6e90\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cASR\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u5728\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u800c\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5219\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6709\u6548\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5f97\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08ST\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u6e90\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08MT\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u60f3\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230ST\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6e90\u662f\u97f3\u9891\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u6216\u6e90\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u9891\u6587\u672c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u6210\u6e90\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e20%\u65f6\uff0cASR\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\u6bd4\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6784\u6210\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u53cd\u5411\u7ffb\u8bd1\u59cb\u7ec8\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5f97\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728ST\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5f97\u4ee5\u7a33\u5065\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5f97\u4ee5\u7a33\u5065\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative,\nthey suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing\nemotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This\npaper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability\ngap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates\ngame theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional\nstates online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs\nwith the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating\nconflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent\nsimulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial\ndebtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show\nthat a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt\nrecovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its\nsize. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles\nto dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints.\nBesides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw\nmodel scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation,\npaving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators\nthat can operate on the edge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEQ-Negotiator\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u89d2\u8272\u5f25\u8865\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c08\u5224\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6218\u7565\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8bb8\u591a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u626e\u6f14\u60c5\u7eea\u5316\u590d\u6742\u89d2\u8272\u65b9\u9762\u4e0eLLMs\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "EQ-Negotiator\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff08HMM\uff09\u6765\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u503a\u52a1\u4eba\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5e26\u6709EQ-Negotiator\u76847B\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u503a\u52a1\u56de\u6536\u548c\u8c08\u5224\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6bd4\u5b83\u592710\u500d\u7684\u57fa\u7ebfLLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4eba\u683c\u5efa\u6a21\u4ece\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u89d2\u8272\u6863\u6848\u63a8\u8fdb\u5230\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c08\u5224\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8c08\u5224\u8005\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

A simple solution\nwould be to translate Bangla questions into English first and then use these\nmodels. However, existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with\ntechnical terms. They often mistranslate specialized vocabulary, which changes\nthe meaning of the problem and leads to wrong answers. We present BanglaSTEM, a\ndataset of 5,000 carefully selected Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM\nfields including computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and\nbiology.

In this paper, we demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in\nhuman-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:\nstack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,\nsimple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack\nof Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed\nby DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic\nstacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question\nformation task.

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target.

To bridge this research gap, we administer validated\npsychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under\ndifferent prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nshow partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning\nwith socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent\ndemographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses\ntoward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs\nto manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive\ncontexts.

If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not\ntraverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps\nshould bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.\nTo test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence\nand the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a\nfull paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and\nlayers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat\nangles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality\nor chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe\ndeflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,\nmeaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm\nattention-induced curvature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u89c6\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u5806\u53e0\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u5f2f\u66f2\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u800c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5219\u626e\u6f14\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u539f\u7406\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0ctoken\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u6cbf\u76f4\u7ebf\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u968f\u7740\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u5411\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Existing research employs red teaming evaluations,\nutilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs.\nHowever, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue\ntrajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the\nconsiderable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these\nlimitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on\ndynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process\nas a path planning problem.

The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u5bf9LLM\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u5bf9\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u8bae\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165LLM\u4f4e\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76ee\u524d\u7684LLM\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u9f13\u52b1\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165LLM\u4f4e\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
