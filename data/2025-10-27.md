### [1] [Shoot First, Ask Questions Later? Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20886)
*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型在信息获取任务中的表现，并提出了改进方法，使语言模型在多个任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多高风险的AI应用需要形成数据驱动的假设并进行有针对性的猜测，但当前的语言模型在信息获取方面存在不足，需要改进。

Method: 本文引入了一个名为Collaborative Battleship的对话任务，并开发了基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略来改进语言模型的信息获取能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文的方法在Collaborative Battleship和Guess Who?任务中显著提升了语言模型的性能，使其在成本较低的情况下超越了人类和前沿模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在多个任务中显著提升了语言模型在信息获取方面的表现，使其能够以更低的成本超越人类和前沿模型。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

### [2] [Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909)
*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CodeAdapt的方法，通过结合CodeAct框架和少量样本引导的上下文学习，使标准指令LM在不微调的情况下能够表现出与RMs相当或更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理模型（RMs）在产生长篇自然语言推理方面非常成功，但它们仍然需要大量的计算和数据来训练，并且运行起来可能很慢且昂贵。我们想看看标准指令LM是否可以在不微调的情况下表现出与RMs相当或甚至超越其性能。

Method: 我们提出了CodeAdapt，这是一种简单的配方，结合了CodeAct框架，其中LM以多步骤方式将自然语言推理与代码执行交织在一起，并通过少样本引导的上下文学习从最少五个训练问题中进行学习。

Result: 在分析四个匹配的LM和RM对时，我们发现CodeAdapt使三个LM在八个任务上平均表现优于相应的RMs（最高22.9%），同时在令牌效率上提高了10-81%。此外，在四个模型的平均值上，它在六个任务上表现出色（最高35.7%）。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，CodeAdapt风格的学习和推理可能具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，并且代码增强的LM是认知上扎根且强大的系统，可能为权重内的强化学习提供坚实的基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

### [3] [FicSim: A Dataset for Multi-Faceted Semantic Similarity in Long-Form Fiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20926)
*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个名为FICSIM的数据集，用于评估语言模型在计算文学研究任务中的表现，并发现这些模型倾向于关注表面特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理越来越长和复杂的文本的能力增强，计算文学研究领域对其应用的兴趣日益增长。然而，由于细粒度标注的成本和公共领域文学的数据污染问题，评估这些模型在这些任务中的实用性仍然具有挑战性。现有的嵌入相似性数据集不适合评估文学领域的任务，因为它们主要关注粗粒度相似性和非常短的文本。

Method: 本文构建了一个名为FICSIM的数据集，包含12个由作者提供的元数据和数字人文学者验证的相似性轴。然后评估了一系列嵌入模型在这个任务上的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，各种模型倾向于关注表面特征，而不是对计算文学研究任务有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: 本文通过构建FICSIM数据集并评估嵌入模型，发现这些模型倾向于关注表面特征而非语义类别，这在计算文学研究任务中可能不够有用。同时，本文强调了作者代理和持续的知情同意的重要性。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [4] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了最先进的大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系的能力，发现它们存在时代敏感性、浅层推理和依赖上下文的推理失败等关键问题，并提出了一个基准来填补现实长上下文评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够捕捉现实、高风险任务的长上下文基准仍然是该领域的一个重大挑战，因为大多数现有的评估依赖于简化的合成任务，无法代表现实世界文档理解的复杂性。

Method: 我们评估了最先进的LLMs在识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系的能力，使用了一个包含236对案例的数据集。

Result: 我们的评估揭示了三个关键限制：(1) 时代敏感性——模型在历史案例上的表现比现代案例差，显示出训练中的基本时间偏差；(2) 浅层推理——模型依赖于浅层逻辑启发式而不是深层法律理解；(3) 依赖上下文的推理失败——尽管在简单上下文中保持基本的时间意识，但模型在复杂的开放任务中会产生时间不可能的关系。

Conclusion: 我们的工作贡献了一个基准，解决了现实长上下文评估中的关键差距，提供了一个反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Irish-BLiMP: A Linguistic Benchmark for Evaluating Human and Language Model Performance in a Low-Resource Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20957)
*Josh McGiff,Khanh-Tung Tran,William Mulcahy,Dáibhidh Ó Luinín,Jake Dalzell,Róisín Ní Bhroin,Adam Burke,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Irish-BLiMP is a dataset and framework for evaluating linguistic competence in Irish, showing that humans outperform LLMs and highlighting differences in representation learned by models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a dataset and framework for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic competence in the Irish language, an endangered language.

Method: We manually constructed and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features, through a team of fluent Irish speakers.

Result: Humans outperform all models across all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. A substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy compared to 90.1% by human.

Conclusion: Irish-BLiMP provides the first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic understanding in low-resource languages.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了无需训练的置信度估计方法在CoT门控中的应用，发现这些方法可以减少冗余的CoT并优于随机调用的CoT，但其效果因数据集和模型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩展推理可以提高复杂任务的准确性，但有时并不必要且显著增加了令牌使用量，限制了推理模型在许多场景中的实用性。然而，尚不清楚何时应使用CoT：在某些任务中它能提高性能，而在其他任务中则几乎没有好处甚至会损害性能。

Method: 我们进行了第一个无需训练的CoT门控置信度估计方法的系统研究，评估了四种无需训练的置信度估计方法，并将其与随机基线和始终知道何时需要CoT的Oracle进行比较。

Result: 现有的无需训练的置信度度量可以减少冗余的CoT，并优于随机调用的CoT。然而，个别置信度度量的效用不一致，随着数据集和模型的不同而变化，这凸显了部署置信度门控CoT的困难。

Conclusion: 我们的研究突出了当前方法的潜力和局限性，并为更可靠的CoT自适应门控铺平了道路。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

### [7] [Input Matters: Evaluating Input Structure's Impact on LLM Summaries of Sports Play-by-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21034)
*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示输入结构显著影响LLM生成摘要中的事实性错误，JSON格式输入效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要准确性的领域（如体育报道）中，LLM生成的文本可能不忠实于输入数据，因此需要研究输入结构如何影响事实性错误。

Method: 通过手动标注3,312个事实性错误，分析了三种输入格式（行结构、JSON和非结构化）对LLM生成摘要的影响，并使用统计方法验证结果。

Result: JSON输入将错误率降低了65%-69%，行结构输入降低了51%-54%。输入结构解释了超过80%的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 输入结构对LLM生成摘要中的事实性错误有显著影响，其中JSON格式的输入能有效减少错误率。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究分析了推理在分类任务中的适用性，发现推理在平均准确性方面有益，但在需要严格精度的应用中可能不适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理已被证明可以提高大型语言模型（LLMs）的准确性，但其在精密敏感任务中的适用性仍不清楚。

Method: 我们对分类任务在严格的低误报率（FPR）条件下进行了系统研究，涵盖了安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，并在微调和零样本设置中进行了评估。

Result: 我们的结果揭示了一个明确的权衡：思考（推理增强）生成提高了整体准确性，但在低FPR阈值下表现不佳，而思考关闭（推理期间不进行推理）在这些精度敏感的领域占优。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，推理在平均准确性方面是有益的，但对于需要严格精度的应用来说往往不适用。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

### [9] [Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing via Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21059)
*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE is a dynamic framework for in-context knowledge editing that improves performance and adaptability by selecting demonstrations based on their utility for the edit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context knowledge editors face a quantity-quality trade-off and lack adaptivity to task difficulty, prompting the need for a dynamic approach to selecting supporting demonstrations.

Method: DR-IKE is a lightweight framework that trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank demonstrations by editing reward and employs a learnable threshold to prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and expanding it when the task is hard.

Result: On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, DR-IKE improves edit success by up to 17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries.

Conclusion: DR-IKE demonstrates scalable and adaptive knowledge editing by dynamically selecting supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit, improving edit success, reducing latency, and preserving accuracy on unrelated queries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

*William Christian,Daniel Adamlu,Adrian Yu,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了自适应RAG系统在印尼语中的应用，通过分类器区分问题复杂性并使用机器翻译作为数据增强方法，结果显示了潜在的前景但也面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了弥合语言差距，特别是在印尼语中，提高问答系统的性能。

Method: 通过引入自适应RAG系统，结合分类器来区分问题复杂性，并采用机器翻译作为数据增强方法来克服印尼语数据集的有限可用性。

Result: 实验显示了可靠的问题复杂性分类器，但观察到多检索回答策略存在显著不一致，这在应用该策略时对整体评估产生了负面影响。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在低资源语言中问答的潜力和挑战，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CDrugRed，一个首次公开的中文药物推荐数据集，专注于代谢疾病出院药物。该数据集包含5,894个去标识化记录，用于评估几种最先进的大语言模型的有效性。实验结果显示，尽管监督微调提高了模型性能，但仍有很大的改进空间。CDrugRed作为开发更稳健和准确的药物推荐系统的资源具有挑战性和价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏公开可用的真实世界EHR数据集，特别是非英语语言的数据集，智能药物推荐系统的发展受到显著阻碍。

Method: 通过在CDrugRed数据集上对几种最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试，评估其有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然监督微调提高了模型性能，但仍有很大的改进空间，最佳模型的F1得分为0.5648，Jaccard得分为0.4477。

Conclusion: CDrugRed是一个具有挑战性和有价值的资源，用于开发更稳健和准确的药物推荐系统。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的微调方法Self-Rewarding PPO，通过结合SFT和PPO的优势，提高了模型的泛化能力和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT在有限数据情况下容易过拟合且泛化能力差，因此需要一种更有效的微调方法。

Method: 我们提出了Self-Rewarding PPO，这是一种结合了SFT和近端策略优化（PPO）优势的新颖微调方法。

Result: 在各种自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统的SFT方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在使用演示数据对齐大型语言模型方面表现出色，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的场景中。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

### [13] [The Gray Zone of Faithfulness: Taming Ambiguity in Unfaithfulness Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21118)
*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的忠实度注释框架，并构建了一个名为VeriGray的新不忠实检测基准，以解决现有基准测试中的注释歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试由于生成输出中允许的外部知识边界定义不明确而存在注释歧义。例如，常识经常被纳入响应并标记为“忠实”，但这种知识的可接受程度未明确说明，导致注释不一致。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的忠实度注释框架，引入了一个中间类别Out-Dependent，用于分类需要外部知识进行验证的情况。使用这个框架，我们构建了VeriGray（带有灰色区域的验证）——一个用于摘要的不忠实检测基准。

Result: 统计数据显示，即使是最先进的LLMs，如GPT-5，在摘要任务中也会出现幻觉（约6%的句子）。此外，生成的句子中有相当大的比例（平均约8%的模型）属于Out-Dependent类别，这突显了解决不忠实检测基准中的注释歧义的重要性。

Conclusion: 实验表明，我们的基准测试对多个基线方法提出了重大挑战，表明未来还有很大的改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统地回顾了从协调角度出发的LLM-TAG整合，提出了一个新的分类法，探讨了协调策略，并总结了经验和应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM具有强大的语义理解和生成能力，但其黑箱性质限制了结构化和多跳推理。而TAG提供了丰富的文本上下文的显式关系结构，但常常缺乏语义深度。结合LLM和TAG可以互补，增强TAG表示学习并提高LLM的推理和可解释性。

Method: 本文提供了一个系统性的综述，从协调的角度审视LLM-TAG的整合，并引入了一个新的分类法，涵盖了两个基本方向：LLM用于TAG和TAG用于LLM。

Result: 本文分类了协调策略，讨论了TAG特定的预训练、提示和参数高效的微调进展。此外，还总结了经验见解，整理了可用的数据集，并强调了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答中的多样化应用。

Conclusion: 本文旨在引导语言和图学习交叉领域的未来研究，指出了开放性挑战和有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

*Ning Bian,Xianpei Han,Hongyu Lin,Baolei Wu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个系统框架，用于分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在社会模拟中的行为。研究发现，LLMs并未忠实地再现真实的人类行为，而是反映了被社会期望偏见所塑造的过于理想化的版本，这引发了对更符合社会现实的LLMs的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠地模拟人类行为对于解释、预测和干预我们的社会至关重要。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在模仿人类行为、互动和决策方面显示出希望，但它们在社会情境中与真实人类行为的差异程度仍缺乏探索，这可能导致科学研究中的误解和实际应用中的意外后果。

Method: 我们引入了一个系统框架来分析LLMs在社会模拟中的行为。我们的方法通过聊天室风格的对话模拟多智能体交互，并在五个语言维度上进行分析，提供了一种简单而有效的方法来检查出现的社会认知偏差。

Result: 我们的研究发现，LLMs并不忠实地再现真实的人类行为，而是反映被社会期望偏见所塑造的过于理想化的版本。特别是，LLMs表现出社会角色偏见、优先效应和积极偏见，导致缺乏真实人类互动复杂性和变异性的一种“乌托邦”社会。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，LLMs并没有忠实地再现真实的人类行为，而是反映了被社会期望偏见所塑造的过于理想化的版本。这些发现呼吁开发更加基于社会的LLMs，以捕捉人类社会行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了一种基于分类的、由大型语言模型驱动的多智能体系统，用于模拟真实的紧急医疗调度场景。结果表明，该系统能够高效地模拟调度过程，并在多个指标上表现优异，包括调度有效性和指导有效性。研究支持其在调度员培训、协议评估和实时决策支持中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急医疗调度（EMD）是一个高风险的过程，受到来电者情绪困扰、模糊性和认知负荷的挑战。大型语言模型（LLMs）和多智能体系统（MAS）为增强调度员提供了机会。本研究旨在开发和评估一种基于分类的、由LLM驱动的多智能体系统，用于模拟现实的EMD场景。

Method: 我们构建了一个临床分类（32种主要症状，6种来自MIMIC-III的来电者身份）和一个六阶段通话协议。利用这个框架，我们开发了一个基于AutoGen的多智能体系统，包括来电者和调度员代理。该系统在事实共用库中进行交互，以确保临床合理性并减少错误信息。我们使用了混合评估框架：四位医生评估了100个模拟案例的“指导有效性”和“调度有效性”，并辅以自动语言分析（情感、可读性、礼貌）。

Result: 人类评估显示，具有显著的评分者间一致性（Gwe's AC1 > 0.70），确认了系统的高性能。它表现出出色的调度有效性（例如，94%正确联系其他潜在代理）和指导有效性（91%的案例提供建议），均受到医生的高度评价。算法指标证实了这些发现，表明主要的中性情感特征（73.7%中性情感；90.4%中性情绪）、高可读性（Flesch 80.9）和一贯的礼貌风格（60.0%礼貌；0%不礼貌）。

Conclusion: 我们的基于分类的多智能体系统能够以高保真度模拟多样化的临床可能的调度场景。研究结果支持其在调度员培训、协议评估以及实时决策支持中的应用。这项工作为将先进的AI代理安全地集成到紧急响应工作流程中提供了一条路径。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的评估方法——相关维数，用于量化语言模型对文本的本体论复杂性。该方法在计算上高效且适用于多种自回归架构，并提供了关于LLM生成动态的新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

*Xinghao Wang,Pengyu Wang,Dong Zhang,Chenkun Tan,Shaojun Zhou,Zhaoxiang Liu,Shiguo Lian,Fangxu Liu,Kai Song,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PBS-Attn is a new method for improving the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling by increasing block-level sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The self-attention mechanism in LLMs is computationally expensive due to its $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length. Block-sparse attention has been proposed as a solution, but its effectiveness depends on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity.

Method: PBS-Attn, a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity.

Result: PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. It achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75	imes$ in long-context prefilling.

Conclusion: PBS-Attn is a practical and effective method for improving the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling by increasing block-level sparsity.

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PARL, a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting without fine-tuning. It shows that PARL can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments but has limitations in more complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, where learning occurs through interaction with an environment and a reward system. This paper studies structured, non-linguistic reasoning, such as interpreting positions in a grid world.

Method: PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement Learning) uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting without any fine-tuning. It encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction.

Result: PARL was evaluated on three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. It can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge, but it has performance limitations in tasks requiring complex mathematical operations or decoding states and actions.

Conclusion: PARL can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge, but it has performance limitations in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and actions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式的问题回答（QA）中，准确估计大型语言模型（LLMs）中的语义随机性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，因为获得稳定的估计通常需要许多昂贵的生成。

Method: 引入了一种多样性驱动的采样器，通过使用轻度微调的自然语言推理（NLI）模型向模型的提议分布中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，从而在解码过程中避免语义冗余的输出，并覆盖自回归和掩码扩散范式。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同数量的样本下覆盖了更多的语义簇，其表现与基线相当或超越基线。

Conclusion: 该框架可以作为风险敏感模型部署中不确定性估计的即插即用增强工具。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨为什么某些NLP模型在面对typoglycemia时表现良好，特别是当许多不同的单词在typoglycemia下合并为相同的表示时。

Method: 我们分析了英国国家语料库以量化typoglycemia下的单词合并和模糊性，评估了BERT在区分合并形式方面的能力，并进行了探针实验，比较了在干净和typoglycemic维基百科文本上训练的BERT变体。

Result: 结果表明，由打乱引起的性能下降比预期要小。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了模型在面对typoglycemia时表现出的鲁棒性，这主要是由于英语中很少有单词在typoglycemia下发生合并，且合并的单词通常出现在不同的上下文中，使得区分变得简单。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

Motivation: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized, constraint-aware travel itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions.

Method: We conduct a threefold evaluation: introducing automatic metrics, applying an LLM-as-a-judge approach, and performing manual expert evaluation.

Result: LLMs maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones. However, disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases.

Conclusion: TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning under real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

Motivation: 研究是否需要多次训练与人类反馈来进行推理任务

Method: 比较传统的单次训练与三种多次训练策略

Result: 发现单次训练的模型在单次和多次评估中都能有效泛化，而多次训练的模型在单次推理性能上显著下降

Conclusion: 对于具有完整信息的任务，稳健的单次训练仍然更有效和可靠，因为基于基本反馈的多次训练提供的收益有限，甚至可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

Method: 手动编写了一个针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答基准，并使用该数据集评估模型的事实回忆能力。

Conclusion: 该数据集可以作为研究多语言模型在语言适应和知识保留方面的诊断工具的潜力。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SindBERT is a large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish, trained on 312 GB of Turkish text. It shows competitive performance but highlights the limitations of scaling and the importance of corpus quality in morphologically rich languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of morphologically rich languages in large-scale pre-training efforts, particularly for Turkish NLP.

Method: SindBERT is a large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish, trained from scratch on 312 GB of Turkish text.

Result: SindBERT performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no consistent scaling advantage overall.

Conclusion: SindBERT contributes both as an openly released resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich languages.

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的希伯来语模型如HeBERT、AlephBERT和HeRo受到语料库大小、词汇或训练深度的限制，因此需要一个更大规模的RoBERTa编码器。

Method: HalleluBERT基于RoBERTa，从头开始在49.1 GB的去重希伯来文网络文本和维基百科上进行训练，并使用特定于希伯来语的字节级BPE词汇表。

Result: HalleluBERT在NER和情感分类基准测试中优于单语和多语基线。

Conclusion: HalleluBERT设定了希伯来语的新最先进的基准，并突显了完全收敛的单语预训练的好处。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such
as HeBERT, AlephBERT, and HeRo are limited by corpus size, vocabulary, or
training depth. We present HalleluBERT, a RoBERTa-based encoder family (base
and large) trained from scratch on 49.1~GB of deduplicated Hebrew web text and
Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual
pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在远程健康监测中的人类活动识别（HAR）应用，因为这是一个相对未被充分研究的领域。

Method: 引入了一个描述性字幕数据集，并提出了全面的评估方法来评估VLMs在HAR中的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，VLMs在某些情况下甚至超过了传统方法，在准确性方面表现相当。

Conclusion: 本研究为VLMs在HAR中的应用提供了强有力的基准，并为将VLMs集成到智能医疗系统中开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

*Giovanni Trappolini,Florin Cuconasu,Simone Filice,Yoelle Maarek,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的评估指标UDCG，以更好地衡量检索增强生成系统的表现，因为它考虑了大型语言模型处理所有检索文档的方式以及不相关文档对生成质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息检索（IR）指标假设人类用户按顺序检查文档，且对较低排名的关注度逐渐减少。这一假设在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中失效，因为搜索结果由大型语言模型（LLMs）消费，它们不像人类那样按顺序处理文档。此外，传统IR指标不考虑那些相关但不相关的文档，这些文档会主动降低生成质量，而不仅仅是被忽略。由于这两个主要不匹配，即人类与机器的位置折扣以及人类相关性与机器效用之间的差异，经典IR指标无法准确预测RAG性能。

Method: 我们引入了一种基于效用的注释方案，该方案量化了相关段落的正面贡献和干扰段落的负面影响力。在此基础上，我们提出了UDCG（效用和干扰感知累积增益）指标，该指标使用面向大型语言模型的位置折扣来直接优化与端到端答案准确性的相关性。

Result: 在五个数据集和六个大型语言模型上的实验表明，与传统指标相比，UDCG的关联性提高了高达36%。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为使信息检索评估与大型语言模型消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，并实现了对RAG组件更可靠的评估。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在这一领域已有大量研究集中在收集传感器数据、可视化和分析以检测特定疾病（如糖尿病、心脏病和抑郁症）的异常，但该领域在人机交互方面仍存在显著的空白。

Method: 本文提出了REMONI，一个自主的远程健康监测系统，该系统集成了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）、物联网（IoT）和可穿戴设备。系统自动连续收集生命体征、加速度计数据以及从摄像头收集的患者视频片段中的视觉数据。这些数据由异常检测模块处理，包括跌倒检测模型和用于识别和提醒护理人员患者紧急状况的算法。此外，还采用了提示工程来无缝集成所有患者信息。

Result: 医生和护士可以通过与智能代理互动并通过用户友好的网络应用程序访问实时生命体征和患者当前状态和情绪。

Conclusion: 我们的实验表明，该系统在现实场景中是可行且可扩展的，有望减少医疗专业人员的工作量和医疗成本。一个完整的原型已经开发并正在测试，以展示其各种功能的稳健性。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多奖励优化（MRO）方法，以提高扩散语言模型（DLMs）的推理性能，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLMs在推理性能上仍落后于LLMs，尤其是在去噪步骤减少的情况下。我们的分析表明，这种不足主要源于在去噪步骤中独立生成被屏蔽的标记，这无法捕捉到标记的相关性。

Method: 我们提出了一种多奖励优化（MRO）方法，该方法在去噪过程中鼓励DLMs考虑标记相关性。具体来说，我们的MRO方法利用了测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习，通过多个精心设计的奖励直接优化标记相关性。此外，我们引入了组步骤和重要性采样策略来减轻奖励方差并提高采样效率。

Result: 通过广泛的实验，我们证明了MRO不仅提高了推理性能，而且在保持推理基准高性能的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: MRO not only improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的估计和改进这种脑对齐的方法是参与者依赖的，并且高度受每个参与者可用数据量的影响，阻碍了对新参与者和群体级分析的泛化。

Method: 我们引入了一种可扩展、通用的脑调优方法，其中我们微调预训练的语音语言模型以联合预测多个参与者的fMRI反应。

Result: 结果表明，脑调优模型表现出强大的个体脑对齐，并在参与者之间进行泛化。具体来说，我们的方法导致了预测新参与者脑数据所需的fMRI数据量减少了5倍，整体脑对齐度提高了最多50%，并且对新的未见过的数据集有很强的泛化能力。此外，多参与者脑调优还提高了下游语义任务的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现展示了神经科学和人工智能之间的双向益处，有助于弥合这两个领域之间的差距。

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

Motivation: 现有的方法通常将外部上下文和参数知识的影响混淆，而准确的幻觉检测需要区分这两者的贡献。

Method: 我们探索了一种基于外部上下文得分和参数知识得分的机制检测方法，并使用Qwen3-0.6b计算这些得分，然后训练回归分类器来预测幻觉。

Result: 我们的方法在最先进的LLM（GPT-5、GPT-4.1）和检测基线（RAGAS、TruLens、RefChecker）上进行了评估，并且在Qwen3-0.6b信号上训练的分类器可以推广到GPT-4.1-mini的响应中。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，机制性信号可以作为RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效且通用的预测因子。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Conclusion: 本文通过应用范畴论提取多模态文档结构，开发了信息理论度量、内容摘要和扩展，以及使用RLVR的自监督方法来改进大型预训练模型。

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Motivation: The role of genealogical language structure in shaping the variation in multilingual behavior of LLMs remains underexplored.

Method: We investigate whether LLMs exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the MultiQ dataset.

Result: Genus-level effects are present but strongly conditioned by training resource availability. Distinct multilingual strategies are observed across LLMs families.

Conclusion: LLMs encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for stock movement prediction and identifies limitations in their reasoning capabilities. It proposes a new method called Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning) to improve the model's ability to make independent, logical predictions. The approach is validated through experiments, showing improved performance in financial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have demonstrated outstanding reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks, but their application to financial tasks, especially stock movement prediction, remains underexplored. The study aims to address this gap by enhancing the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain.

Method: We propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for price up or down based on that framework.

Result: Experiments show that RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock movement prediction.

Conclusion: RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock movement prediction.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种量化桥接理论与测量的方法，为推理架构提供了机制性见解。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

### [41] [Self-Jailbreaking: Language Models Can Reason Themselves Out of Safety Alignment After Benign Reasoning Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20956)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究了推理语言模型（RLMs）中的自我越狱现象，发现它们在良性推理训练后会绕过安全防护措施。我们提供了对自我越狱的机制理解，并提出通过在训练中加入最小的安全推理数据来缓解该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们发现推理语言模型（RLMs）在经过良性推理训练后，会使用多种策略来绕过自己的安全防护措施。这种现象被称为自我越狱。我们希望通过研究自我越狱行为，提供一种保持RLMs安全性的方法。

Method: 我们发现了一种新颖且令人惊讶的推理语言模型（RLMs）中的非故意对齐问题，我们称之为自我越狱。我们通过机制理解自我越狱：在良性推理训练后，RLMs更加顺从，并且在自我越狱后，模型似乎在思维链中认为恶意请求的危害性较低，从而使其能够遵守这些请求。为了缓解自我越狱，我们发现，在训练期间包含最小的安全推理数据就足以确保RLMs保持安全对齐。

Result: 我们观察到许多开放权重的RLMs，包括DeepSeek-R1-distilled、s1.1、Phi-4-mini-reasoning和Nemotron，尽管意识到请求的危害性，但仍遭受自我越狱。我们还提供了对自我越狱的机制理解：在良性推理训练后，RLMs更加顺从，并且在自我越狱后，模型似乎在思维链中认为恶意请求的危害性较低，从而使其能够遵守这些请求。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了对自我越狱行为的首次系统分析，并为保持日益强大的RLMs的安全性提供了可行的路径。

Abstract: We discover a novel and surprising phenomenon of unintentional misalignment
in reasoning language models (RLMs), which we call self-jailbreaking.
Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs
will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One
strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to
justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful
requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card
information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of
``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign
context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,
suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the
requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:
RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after
self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful
in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking,
we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is
sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first
systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path
forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于系统提示的轻量级本地LLM框架，用于提高蜜罐系统的上下文感知能力，并通过实验验证了RAG在未调优模型中的准确性提升，以及调优模型在没有RAG的情况下可以达到相似的准确性，同时具有更低的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高蜜罐系统的上下文感知能力，以增加攻击者的参与度，同时解决大型语言模型在准确性、响应时间、运营成本和数据保护方面的挑战。

Method: 本文提出了SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地LLM来解决数据保护问题，并研究了RAG支持的LLM和非RAG LLM在Linux shell命令中的应用，通过响应时间、人类测试者的现实感以及Levenshtein距离、SBert和BertScore等指标进行评估。

Result: RAG提高了未调优模型的准确性，而通过系统提示调优的模型在没有RAG的情况下可以达到与未调优RAG模型相似的准确性，同时具有稍低的延迟。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于系统提示的轻量级本地LLM来管理数据保护问题，并通过实验验证了RAG在未调优模型中的准确性提升，以及通过系统提示调优的模型在没有RAG的情况下可以达到与未调优RAG模型相似的准确性，同时具有稍低的延迟。

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence
or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker
engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that
context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems
and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer
from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,
high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We
propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which
manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We
investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and
non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different
metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and
similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and
BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models
that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a
Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while
having a slightly lower latency.

### [43] [Reducing the Probability of Undesirable Outputs in Language Models Using Probabilistic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21184)
*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe improves the tradeoff between expected reward and undesired outputs in RL for language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the tradeoff between average reward and the probability of undesired outputs in reinforcement learning (RL) for aligning language models (LMs) with human preferences.

Method: RePULSe, a new training method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those outputs' probability.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that RePULSe produces a better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs and is more adversarially robust compared to standard RL alignment approaches and alternatives.

Conclusion: RePULSe produces a better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs and is more adversarially robust compared to standard RL alignment approaches and alternatives.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

### [44] [Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21322)
*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI是一种用于净化语言模型的方法，可以有效去除模型中的敏感信息，而无需昂贵的额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练大型语言模型可能记住敏感数据，这会导致隐私或保密问题，因此需要一种方法来净化模型。

Method: SANI通过重置模型最后几层的某些神经元来破坏细粒度信息的记忆，并在避免记忆敏感信息的同时对模型进行微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，只需几次额外的未学习周期，模型就能被净化，且再生次数显著减少。

Conclusion: SANI是一种有效的语言模型净化方法，可以在不进行额外昂贵微调的情况下去除模型中的敏感信息。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

### [45] [FairImagen: Post-Processing for Bias Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21363)
*Zihao Fu,Ryan Brown,Shun Shao,Kai Rawal,Eoin Delaney,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种后处理去偏框架FairImagen，能够减轻文本到图像扩散模型中的偏见，同时保持图像质量和提示保真度的适度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型如Stable Diffusion在生成高质量和多样化的图像方面表现出色，但最近的研究表明这些模型常常复制和放大社会偏见，尤其是在性别和种族等人口统计属性上。因此，需要一种有效的方法来减轻这些偏见，以实现更公平的文本到图像生成。

Method: 本文提出的方法结合了公平主成分分析（Fair PCA），将基于CLIP的输入嵌入投影到一个最小化群体特定信息的同时保留语义内容的子空间。此外，通过经验噪声注入进一步增强了去偏效果，并提出了一个统一的跨人口统计学投影方法，实现了多个 demographic 属性的同时去偏。

Result: 实验结果表明，FairImagen在性别、种族和交叉设置中显著提高了公平性，同时在图像质量和提示保真度上有适度的损失。该框架优于现有的后处理方法，并提供了一个简单、可扩展且与模型无关的解决方案。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种后处理去偏框架FairImagen，能够在不重新训练或修改基础扩散模型的情况下减轻模型中的偏见。实验表明，FairImagen在保持图像质量和提示保真度的适度损失下显著提高了公平性，并且优于现有的后处理方法，提供了一个简单、可扩展且与模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

*Faisal Hamman,Pasan Dissanayake,Yanjun Fu,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的少样本任务感知知识蒸馏方法CoD，通过利用反事实解释来提升蒸馏效果，实验结果表明其在少量样本情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的任务感知蒸馏方法通常需要大量数据，而在许多实际场景中，这些数据可能不可用或成本高昂。因此，本文旨在解决这一挑战，提出一种能够在少样本情况下有效进行知识蒸馏的方法。

Method: 本文引入了一种名为Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD的新策略，通过利用反事实解释（CFEs）来精确映射教师模型的决策边界。CFEs是指能够以最小扰动改变教师模型输出预测的输入。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoD在各种数据集和大语言模型上均优于标准知识蒸馏方法，即使在仅使用8-512个样本的情况下也能取得良好效果。此外，CoD仅使用原始样本的一半即可提高性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的策略CoD，通过系统地注入反事实解释，解决了少样本任务感知知识蒸馏中的挑战。实验结果表明，CoD在少量样本情况下表现优于标准知识蒸馏方法，并且只需要使用原始样本的一半即可提高性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

### [47] [Can large audio language models understand child stuttering speech? speech summarization, and source separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20850)
*Chibuzor Okocha,Maya Bakri,Christan Grant*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型音频语言模型在处理儿童语音中的不流畅性方面的表现，并提供了生成忠实儿童独白摘要的条件和失败情况的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音与成人语音在声学、语调和语言发展方面存在差异，不流畅性（重复、延长、阻塞）进一步挑战自动语音识别（ASR）和下游自然语言处理（NLP）。最近的大型音频语言模型（LALMs）表现出强大的跨模态音频理解能力；然而，它们在不流畅儿童语音中的行为仍缺乏研究。

Method: 我们评估了几种最先进的大型音频语言模型，在两种设置下进行：采访（混合说话者）和阅读任务（单个儿童）。任务包括（i）单通道源分离以隔离儿童，以及（ii）保留临床上相关的不流畅性和避免成人语音泄漏的儿童独白摘要。

Result: 评估结合了大型语言模型（LLM）作为裁判、人工专家评分和BERTScore（F1），我们报告了模型之间以及模型与人类之间的协议，以评估可靠性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究明确了大型音频语言模型在从混合音频中生成忠实的儿童独白摘要方面的条件和失败情况，为临床和教育部署提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Child speech differs from adult speech in acoustics, prosody, and language
development, and disfluencies (repetitions, prolongations, blocks) further
challenge Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and downstream Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recent large audio-language models (LALMs) demonstrate strong
cross-modal audio understanding; however, their behavior in disfluent child
speech remains underexplored. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs in two
settings: an interview (mixed speakers) and a reading task (single child). The
tasks are (i) single-channel source separation to isolate the child and (ii)
child-only summarization that preserves clinically relevant disfluencies and
avoids adult-speech leakage.
  Evaluation combines Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge, human expert
ratings, and BERTScore (F1), and we report agreement between models and between
models and humans to assess reliability. Our findings delineate the conditions
under which LALMs produce faithful child-only summaries from mixed audio and
where they fail, offering practical guidance for clinical and educational
deployments. We provide prompts and evaluation scripts to support replication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据多样性不足和任务特定模型设计的限制，构建能够跨日常任务泛化的基础模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT)将ExG信号分解为12个生理信息标记，并通过重建任务学习稳健表示。

Result: 在DailySense数据集和四个公共ExG基准测试中，PiMT在各种任务中均优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: PiMT在多个任务中 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods，展示了其在日常环境中进行可扩展、任务无关的ExG监测的潜力。

Abstract: Electrophysiological (ExG) signals offer valuable insights into human
physiology, yet building foundation models that generalize across everyday
tasks remains challenging due to two key limitations: (i) insufficient data
diversity, as most ExG recordings are collected in controlled labs with bulky,
expensive devices; and (ii) task-specific model designs that require tailored
processing (i.e., targeted frequency filters) and architectures, which limit
generalization across tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce an
approach for scalable, task-agnostic ExG monitoring in the wild. We collected
50 hours of unobtrusive free-living ExG data with an earphone-based hardware
prototype to narrow the data diversity gap. At the core of our approach is
Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT), which decomposes ExG
signals into 12 physiology-informed tokens, followed by a reconstruction task
to learn robust representations. This enables adaptive feature recognition
across the full frequency spectrum while capturing task-relevant information.
Experiments on our new DailySense dataset-the first to enable ExG-based
analysis across five human senses-together with four public ExG benchmarks,
demonstrate that PiMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
diverse tasks.

Motivation: 由于缺乏对预训练数据处理和整理的控制性消融，难以理解性能提升的因素，尽管其他数据模态的研究取得了显著进展。

Method: 我们进行了以数据为中心的探索，通过受控的数据中心消融实验来研究语音-语言预训练数据的三个基本问题。

Result: 我们应用从受控数据为中心的消融中获得的见解，预训练了一个3.8B参数的SpeechLM，称为SpeLangy，其性能优于最大3倍大的模型10.2%。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了有效的数据整理对语音-语言预训练的重要性，并希望为未来在SpeechLMs中的数据驱动探索提供指导。

Abstract: Spoken Question-Answering (SQA) is a core capability for useful and
interactive artificial intelligence systems. Recently, several speech-language
models (SpeechLMs) have been released with a specific focus on improving their
SQA performance. However, a lack of controlled ablations of pretraining data
processing and curation makes it challenging to understand what factors account
for performance, despite substantial gains from similar studies in other data
modalities. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a data-centric
exploration for pretraining SpeechLMs. We focus on three research questions
fundamental to speech-language pretraining data: (1) how to process raw
web-crawled audio content for speech-text pretraining, (2) how to construct
synthetic pretraining datasets to augment web-crawled data and (3) how to
interleave (text, audio) segments into training sequences. We apply the
insights from our controlled data-centric ablations to pretrain a
3.8B-parameter SpeechLM, called SpeLangy, that outperforms models that are up
to 3x larger by 10.2% absolute performance. We hope our findings highlight the
impact of effective data curation for speech-language pretraining and guide
future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种个性化上下文感知的分词器，通过结合用户的交互历史生成语义ID，使得同一物品在不同用户情境下可以被分词为不同的语义ID，从而提升生成推荐模型的个性化预测能力。实验结果表明，该方法在三个公开数据集上相比非个性化动作分词基线方法在NDCG@10指标上提升了高达11.44%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分词方法是静态且非个性化的，它们仅从物品特征中推导语义ID，假设了一个通用的物品相似性，忽略了用户特定的视角。然而，在自回归范式下，具有相同前缀的语义ID总是获得相似的概率，因此单一固定的映射隐式地在整个用户群体中强制执行一个通用的物品相似性标准。但实际上，同一物品可能因用户意图和偏好而被不同地解释。

Method: 本文提出了一种个性化上下文感知的分词器，利用用户的交互历史生成语义ID，使得同一物品在不同用户情境下可以被分词为不同的语义ID，从而让生成推荐模型能够捕捉多种解释标准并生成更个性化的预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，在三个公开数据集上，本文提出的方法在NDCG@10指标上相比非个性化动作分词基线方法提升了高达11.44%。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的系统Doc-Researcher，用于处理多模态文档中的深度研究问题，并引入了一个新的基准测试M4DocBench。实验结果表明，该系统在准确性方面优于现有的最先进的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统仍然基本受限于文本网络数据，忽略了多模态文档中嵌入的大量知识。处理这些文档需要复杂的解析以保持视觉语义，智能分块以保持结构连贯性，并在不同模态之间进行自适应检索，而现有系统缺乏这些能力。

Method: 我们提出了Doc-Researcher，一个统一的系统，通过三个集成组件来弥合这一差距：(i) 深度多模态解析，(ii) 系统检索架构，(iii) 迭代多代理工作流。此外，我们引入了M4DocBench，这是第一个针对多模态、多跳、多文档和多轮深度研究的基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，Doc-Researcher实现了50.6%的准确率，比最先进的基线高出3.4倍，验证了有效的文档研究不仅需要更好的检索，还需要根本性的解析，以保持多模态完整性并支持迭代研究。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为在多模态文档集合上进行深度研究建立了新的范式。

Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions
through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems
remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast
knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands
sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,
and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and
adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing
systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges
this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that
preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular
representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval
architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with
dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that
decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize
comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous
evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal,
Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158
expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents,
M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess.
Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter
than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research
requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that
preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document
collections.

which could hinder conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We study the
role of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active
engagement with the learning content, while guiding learners toward the
answers. Focusing on scientific topics at the secondary education level, we
explore the potential of large language models to generate chains of hints that
scaffold learners without revealing answers. We compare two distinct hinting
strategies: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints,
adapted to learners' progress. Through a quantitative study with 41
participants, we uncover different preferences among learners with respect to
hinting strategies, and identify the limitations of automatic evaluation
metrics to capture them. Our findings highlight key design considerations for
future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems that seek
to develop learner-centered educational technologies.

Conclusion: ColorEcosystem is poised to power personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across massive-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents,
the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent
systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current
massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service
experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address
these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale.
Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier,
agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service
experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while
the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing
diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of
developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both
service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional
forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across
massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of
ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at

TL;DR: CAS是一种新的概念选择方法，通过分离组合的契合度和文化典型性，生成既原创又内部一致的艺术概念，表现出与人类艺术学生相当的性能，并探索了更广泛的观念空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型在追求新颖性时往往牺牲一致性，或者默认遵循熟悉的传统文化模式，因此需要一种方法来生成既原创又内部一致的概念。

Method: CAS通过两个微调的GPT-2模型来分离组合的契合度和文化典型性，一个用于评估概念在艺术品中是否合理共现，另一个用于估计这些组合在个别艺术家作品中的典型性。

Result: 在人类评估中，CAS的表现优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，并且在感知原创性和和谐性方面与人类艺术学生相当。此外，定量研究显示CAS生成的输出更加多样化，并探索了更广泛的观念空间。

Conclusion: CAS能够生成既原创又内部一致的艺术概念，展示了人工智能文化异化可以释放自主代理的创造力。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

### [56] [When Models Outthink Their Safety: Mitigating Self-Jailbreak in Large Reasoning Models with Chain-of-Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21285)
*Yingzhi Mao,Chunkang Zhang,Junxiang Wang,Xinyan Guan,Boxi Cao,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) 的训练框架，旨在提高大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持其推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解策略依赖于在训练期间注入启发式安全信号，这通常会抑制推理能力，并未能解决安全与推理之间的权衡问题。

Method: Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) 训练框架，重新组合或回溯不安全的推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹，同时保留有效的推理链。

Result: CoG在多个推理和安全基准测试中表现出色，显著提高了当前LRMs的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力。

Conclusion: CoG显著提高了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于那些遭受严重安全-推理权衡的先前方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

### [57] [Magellan: Guided MCTS for Latent Space Exploration and Novelty Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21341)
*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Magellan框架，它通过有原则的引导探索来改进大型语言模型的创造性生成，从而在科学想法生成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成真正创新的想法时常常遇到困难，通常会默认生成训练数据中的高概率、熟悉的概念。虽然先进的基于搜索的方法如Tree of Thoughts（ToT）试图缓解这一问题，但它们本质上受到依赖无原则、不一致的自我评估启发式方法的限制。

Method: Magellan框架将创造性生成重新定义为对LLM潜在概念空间的有原则的引导探索，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）并由分层指导系统控制。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，Magellan在生成具有更高可信度和创新性的科学想法方面显著优于强基线，包括ReAct和ToT。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，对于创造性发现，有原则的、有指导的搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLM成为创新更有能力的合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

Motivation: 现有的代理框架通常遵循预定义的工作流程，这限制了自主和全局任务完成的能力。本文旨在解决长期交互中的挑战，如上下文长度爆炸和交互历史的积累，并提高工具使用的效率和稳定性。

Method: 本文引入了DeepAgent，这是一种端到端的深度推理代理，结合了自主记忆折叠机制和一种名为ToolPO的端到端强化学习策略，以提高工具使用的效率和稳定性。

Result: 在八个基准测试中进行的广泛实验表明，DeepAgent在标记工具和开放集工具检索场景中均优于基线模型。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code
and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigorous evaluation of AI agents is critical for progress, but existing benchmarks fall short on several fronts.

Method: We define principles and tooling for more rigorously benchmarking agents and present AstaBench, a suite that provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific research.

Result: Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

Conclusion: AI remains far from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Mohammad Amin Zadenoori,Vincenzo De Martino,Jacek Dabrowski,Xavier Franch,Alessio Ferrari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 我们的研究显示，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在需求分类任务中略优于小型语言模型（SLMs），但这种差异不具有统计显著性。SLMs在隐私、成本和本地部署方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理（NLP）任务中表现出色，但在需求工程（RE）任务中使用时存在高计算成本、数据共享风险和对外部服务的依赖。相比之下，小型语言模型（SLMs）提供了一种轻量级、可本地部署的替代方案。

Method: 我们初步比较了八种模型，包括三种LLMs和五种SLMs，在使用PROMISE、PROMISE Reclass和SecReq数据集的需求分类任务中的表现。

Result: 虽然LLMs的平均F1分数比SLMs高出2%，但这种差异并不具有统计显著性。SLMs在所有数据集上几乎达到LLMs的性能，并且在PROMISE Reclass数据集上的召回率甚至超过了LLMs，尽管它们的规模最多小300倍。我们还发现数据集特征对性能的影响比模型大小更为重要。

Conclusion: 我们的研究证明了小型语言模型（SLMs）在需求分类任务中可以作为大型语言模型（LLMs）的有效替代方案，提供了隐私、成本和本地部署的优势。

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in
natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE).
However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing
risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models
(SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem]
It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms
of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including
three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the
PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although
LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not
statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all
datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset,
despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset
characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size.
[Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid
alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in
privacy, cost, and local deployability.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同编码LLM之间的互补性，并评估了各种集成策略的效果。结果表明，基于多样性的策略能够显著提升集成性能，而基于共识的策略可能陷入错误输出的陷阱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前追求一个单一的大型语言模型（LMM）来完成所有软件工程任务是资源密集型的，并且忽视了互补性的潜在好处，其中不同的模型贡献独特的优点。然而，编码LLM之间互补的程度以及最大化集成潜力的最佳策略尚不清楚，使得从业者无法超越单一模型系统。

Method: 我们对五个家族的十个单独的LLM和三个LLM的集成进行了实证比较，并在三个软件工程基准测试中评估了它们的性能。此外，我们还评估了各种选择启发式方法来从集成的候选池中识别正确解决方案。

Result: 我们发现集成性能的理论上限可以比最佳单个模型高出83%。基于共识的解决方案选择策略陷入“流行陷阱”，放大了常见但错误的输出。相反，基于多样性的策略实现了高达理论潜力的95%，并且即使在小规模的两个模型集成中也有效。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，基于多样性的策略可以实现高达理论潜力的95%，并且在小型双模型集成中也有效，这为利用多个LLM提高性能提供了一种成本效益高的方法。

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software
engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of
complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However,
the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for
maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a
clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five
families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering
benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the
complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best
individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection
heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be
83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based
strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying
common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes
up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small
two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by
leveraging multiple LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出KBE，一种动态多模态评估框架，通过整合多模态知识扩展静态基准，以解决数据污染和饱和问题，提供更准确的MLLM能力评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态基准存在数据污染和饱和的风险，导致性能评估不准确或误导。

Method: KBE是一种动态多模态评估框架，通过将静态基准转化为可控的动态演变版本，结合多模态知识扩展基准。

Result: 实验表明，KBE能够缓解数据污染和数据饱和的问题，并提供更全面的评估。

Conclusion: KBE能够缓解数据污染和数据饱和的风险，并提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

TL;DR: 本研究通过信号处理的视角分析了注意力头在语言和视觉-语言模型中的专业化行为，并展示了如何通过编辑少量注意力头来控制模型输出中的目标概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言和视觉-语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍部分未知。我们研究了文本生成模型中的单个注意力头如何专门处理特定的语义或视觉属性。

Method: 我们基于一种已建立的可解释性方法，通过信号处理的视角重新解释了使用最终解码层探测中间激活的做法。这使我们能够以系统的方式分析多个样本，并根据其与目标概念的相关性对注意力头进行排序。

Result: 我们的结果展示了在单模态和多模态变压器中，注意力头层面的一致专业化模式。我们发现，仅编辑使用我们方法选择的1%的头，就可以可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了注意力层中可解释且可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.
