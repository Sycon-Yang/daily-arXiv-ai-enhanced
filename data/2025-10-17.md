### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新框架，结合多语言对比奖励信号的组相对策略优化（GRPO），以提高跨语言场景下的文本到SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL方法仅关注可执行查询，忽略了语义对齐挑战，且在非英语语言中执行准确性显著下降。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的框架，结合了多语言对比奖励信号的组相对策略优化（GRPO），以提高跨语言场景下的任务效率和语义准确性。

Result: 在七种语言的MultiSpider数据集上，使用GRPO微调LLaMA-3-3B模型将执行准确性提高到87.4%（比零样本高26个百分点），语义准确性提高到52.29%（比零样本高32.86个百分点）。添加对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确性进一步提高到59.14%（比之前高6.85个百分点）。

Conclusion: 本文展示了通过对比奖励信号改进文本到SQL系统的性能，无需大规模训练数据集。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的系统架构，利用大型语言模型将XAI技术输出转化为临床可用的叙述，以解决XAI在临床实践中的应用障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的XAI技术虽然在生成特征重要性评分等技术上表现良好，但未能提供临床相关且可操作的见解，这阻碍了其在现实世界中的应用。

Method: 本文提出了生成操作框架，该框架利用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为核心翻译引擎，将XAI工具的技术输出与临床指南相结合，以生成可读的、有证据支持的临床叙述。

Result: 本文展示了生成操作框架如何直接解决关键的操作障碍，包括工作流程集成、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定的沟通。

Conclusion: 本文认为，XAI与临床实用性的脱节是一个翻译问题，并提出了生成操作框架，该框架利用大型语言模型作为核心翻译引擎，以解决实际应用中的障碍。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA is a novel watermarking framework that enhances detectability while preserving text quality by leveraging linguistic patterns, enabling publicly verifiable detection without requiring access to model logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing text quality against detection robustness is a central challenge in watermarking for large language models, and existing methods rely on model-specific signals that hinder public verification.

Method: STELA dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled linguistic indeterminacy to align watermark strength with linguistic degrees of freedom.

Result: STELA demonstrates superior detection robustness across typologically diverse languages such as English, Chinese, and Korean.

Conclusion: STELA surpasses prior methods in detection robustness and facilitates publicly verifiable detection.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何利用用户行为模型来提高LLM对齐中用户标注数据的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用户标注数据缺乏质量控制，本文旨在通过分析用户行为来提高标注数据的质量。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于期望最大化算法的方法，用于估计用户的潜在质量因子，并据此过滤用户的标注数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在捕捉用户行为和过滤数据方面是有效的。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过用户行为模型来推断用户标注数据质量的方法，并展示了该方法在LLM对齐中的有效性。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的路由机制，即知情路由，通过评估令牌的即时重要性和可恢复性来提高大型语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态令牌级计算分配方法依赖于贪婪路由，这可能导致不可逆的信息丢失和次优的令牌选择。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 本文提出了轻量级特征预测器（LFF），这是一个小的预测模块，在路由决策之前估计单元的输出，从而实现灵活的执行或近似策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，知情路由在语言建模和推理任务中实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡。即使没有最终的LoRA微调，该方法也能匹配或超越需要完整微调的强基线。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的路由机制，即知情路由，通过评估令牌的即时重要性和可恢复性来解决现有方法中的信息损失和次优选择问题。实验结果表明，知情路由在多个稀疏水平上实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出HIES剪枝标准，通过结合头重要性分数和注意力熵，显著提升模型压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的方法（如HIS）在捕捉梯度驱动贡献方面存在局限，忽略了注意力模式的多样性。

Method: 引入了HIES（Head Importance-Entropy Score）作为新的剪枝标准，将头重要性分数与注意力熵结合，提供每头贡献的补充证据。

Result: HIES-based pruning在模型质量和稳定性上分别提升了15.2%和2.04倍。

Conclusion: HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConDABench is a framework for generating conversational data analysis benchmarks and evaluating tools on them. It includes a multi-agent workflow for generating benchmarks, 1,420 ConDA problems, and an evaluation harness. Evaluation shows that while newer models solve more instances, they may not be better at tasks requiring sustained engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture the complexities of real-world data analysis tasks, which often involve under-specified goals and unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a user's intent, making it essential to solving these complex tasks.

Method: We introduce ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA) benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. It consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement.

Conclusion: ConDABench is an avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于相似性的UQ框架，并通过实验证明其在多个任务中优于基线方法。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

### [9] [Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837)
*Weibin Cai,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了仇恨言论检测中的挑战，并提出了一种文化感知框架，通过构建个体的仇恨子空间来解决数据稀疏性、文化纠缠和模糊标签的问题。实验结果表明，该方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进的方法1.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法常常忽略了一个现实世界的复杂性：训练标签是偏见的，不同文化背景的人对什么是仇恨的解释各不相同。

Method: 我们提出了一个文化感知框架，构建个体的仇恨子空间。为了缓解数据稀疏性，我们建模了文化属性的组合。对于文化纠缠和模糊标签，我们使用标签传播来捕捉每个组合的独特特征。最后，个体的仇恨子空间可以进一步提高分类性能。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进的方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进的方法1.05%。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

Motivation: 由于手动构建本体是一项耗时、昂贵且繁琐的过程，因此需要一种自动化的方法来提取产品本体。

Method: 本文提出了一种完全自动化的从原始评论文本中提取产品本体的方法，利用了最近的大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步。

Conclusion: 本文展示了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行产品本体提取的可行性，并为LLMs在更广泛的本体提取应用中提供了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT is a new poisoning attack that effectively manipulates RAG-based fact-checking systems by injecting adversarial content, achieving high success rates with minimal poisoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to RAG systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking LLMs into producing attacker-controlled outputs. Real-world fact-checking scenarios are more challenging as credible evidence typically dominates the retrieval pool.

Method: ADMIT is a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking decisions and induces deceptive justifications without access to the target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control.

Result: ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4 cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86% at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 	imes 10^{-6}$, and remains robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2% across all settings.

Conclusion: ADMIT exposes significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking

### [12] [Serialized EHR make for good text representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13843)
*Zhirong Chou,Quan Qin,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT is a foundation model designed to encode temporal and contextual relationships in EHR data, showing improved performance in predicting antibiotic susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to reconcile the tabular and event-based nature of EHRs with the sequential priors of natural language models, limiting their ability to capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters.

Method: SerialBEHRT is a domain-aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences to encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events.

Result: SerialBEHRT achieves superior and more consistent performance in antibiotic susceptibility prediction compared to state-of-the-art EHR representation strategies.

Conclusion: SerialBEHRT demonstrates the importance of temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare by achieving superior and more consistent performance in antibiotic susceptibility prediction.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

### [13] [DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DynaSpec的上下文依赖的动态短列表机制，用于加速LLM推理中的推测解码。该方法通过引入轻量级元分类器来选择token聚类，从而在保持验证精确性的同时提高草稿生成效率。实验表明，DynaSpec在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法（如FR-Spec、VocabTrim）限制草稿的词汇表为一个固定的子集，这会导致计算减少但不够稳健，因为频率列表依赖于语料库且需要重新调整以实现泛化，同时静态短列表会抑制罕见或领域特定的token，降低每次验证步骤的预期token数量。

Method: 本文引入了轻量级、粗粒度的元分类器，这些分类器将上下文路由到少量的token聚类中；所选top-k聚类的并集形成草稿的短列表，而验证过程保留完整的词汇表和精确性。此外，元分类器通过在不同的流上并行执行草稿编码和元短列表选择，比草稿隐藏状态生成更快完成计算。

Result: 在标准的推测解码基准测试中，DynaSpec在平均接受长度方面相对于固定短列表基线表现出一致的提升，同时上下文依赖的选择使得可以使用更小的短列表而不影响接受率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为DynaSpec的上下文依赖的动态短列表机制，该机制具有鲁棒性，能够加速草稿生成，并在各种任务中实现良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的推理时间方法，通过在并行翻译上进行PCA来识别语言方向，并沿着这些轴调整标记嵌入以控制语言身份，从而减少代码切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大型语言模型（LLMs）经常表现出不必要的代码切换，这会降低下游任务的可靠性。

Method: 我们提出了一种轻量级的推理时间方法，通过在并行翻译上进行PCA来识别语言方向，并沿着这些轴调整标记嵌入以控制语言身份。

Result: 我们在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，并将下一个标记分布差异减少了高达42%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在保持语义的同时有效减少了代码切换，具有 negligible 计算开销，并且只需要少量的并行数据进行校准。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

TL;DR: 研究通过引入基于熵的度量分析了大型语言模型推理轨迹中的信息流，发现正确的解决方案在信息密度上呈现不均匀波动，这与人类沟通模式不同，从而挑战了关于机器推理的假设并提出了新的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在分析大型语言模型在解决问题时的中间步骤是否忠实或易于解释，并受到心理语言学中统一信息密度假设的启发。

Method: 引入基于熵的度量来分析推理轨迹中的信息流。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，发现成功的推理在全局上是非均匀的：正确的解决方案以信息密度的不均匀波动为特征，这与人类的沟通模式形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并提出了设计可解释和自适应推理模型的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在连续编辑环境中存在显著限制，容易受到灾难性干扰的影响，即新的编辑会破坏之前集成的更新并降低保留的知识。

Method: EvoEdit，一种通过顺序零空间对齐减轻灾难性干扰的新编辑策略，使稳定和高效的模型编辑成为可能。

Result: EvoEdit在现实世界的连续知识编辑基准测试中表现出更好的或相当的性能，速度提高了最多3.53倍。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了在动态演变的信息环境中开发更系统的方法来设计LLMs的必要性，同时提供了一个简单但有效的解决方案，并具有强大的理论保证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在引入ConsistencyAI，这是一个独立的基准，用于衡量不同角色的大语言模型（LLMs）的事实一致性。

Method: ConsistencyAI测试当不同人口统计学的用户提出相同的问题时，模型是否给出事实不一致的回答。通过将响应转换为句子嵌入，计算跨角色余弦相似度，并计算加权平均值来计算事实一致性得分。

Result: 在100个角色的实验中，得分范围从0.9065到0.7896，平均值为0.8656。xAI的Grok-3最一致，而一些轻量级模型排名最低。事实一致性因主题而异：就业市场最不一致，G7世界领导人最一致，而疫苗或巴以冲突等问题则因提供者而异。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，提供者和主题都影响了事实一致性。我们发布了代码和交互式演示，以支持可重复的评估并鼓励无角色提示策略。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BenchPress is a human-in-the-loop system that uses LLMs and RAG to accelerate the creation of domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks, reducing the time and effort required for manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of manually annotating SQL logs to identify which natural language questions they answer, which is time-consuming and costly.

Method: BenchPress is a human-in-the-loop system that uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural language descriptions, which are then selected, ranked, or edited by human experts to ensure accuracy and domain alignment.

Result: The evaluation on annotated enterprise SQL logs shows that LLM-assisted annotation drastically reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks, enhancing annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation robustness.

Conclusion: BenchPress offers a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL models on a given domain-specific workload by streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了R2T框架，这是一种将语言规则融入神经网络训练的混合方法，通过自适应损失函数提高模型处理未登录词的能力。实验表明，R2T在词性标注和命名实体识别任务中均表现优异，尤其在数据有限的情况下效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探索一种称为原理学习（PrL）的范式，其中模型通过显式的任务约束进行训练，而不是仅依赖于标记示例。

Method: R2T框架是一种将语言规则整合到神经网络训练目标中的混合方法，其创新之处在于自适应损失函数，该函数包含一个正则化项，使模型能够以有原则的不确定性处理未登录词。

Result: R2T-BiLSTM模型在仅使用未标记文本的情况下实现了98.2%的准确率，优于在300个标记句子上微调的AfriBERTa基线模型。此外，在更复杂的任务如命名实体识别中，R2T作为预训练步骤表现出色，仅用50个标记句子微调的模型就超过了在300个标记句子上训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: R2T框架在Zarma词性标注任务中表现出色，且在更复杂的命名实体识别任务中作为预训练步骤也显示出优势。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoRE, a technique to enhance the robustness of LLM ensembles by leveraging model consistency at both token and model levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limited attention given to the robustness of LLM ensembles against potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization schemes and varying model expertise.

Method: CoRE is a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for robust LLM ensemble. It includes token-level consistency, which applies a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens, and model-level consistency, which promotes model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoRE consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Conclusion: CoRE consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness across diverse benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies.

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Motivation: 医学视觉问答（MedVQA）允许对医学图像进行自然语言查询，以支持临床决策和患者护理。MEDIQA-WV 2025共享任务解决了伤口护理VQA问题，要求系统从图像和患者查询中生成自由文本响应和结构化伤口属性。

Method: 我们提出了MasonNLP系统，该系统采用通用领域、指令调优的大语言模型，并结合了检索增强生成（RAG）框架，该框架整合了领域内数据的文本和视觉示例。这种方法将输出扎根于临床相关的示例，提高了推理、模式遵循和响应质量。

Result: 我们的最佳系统在19个团队和51个提交中排名第三，平均得分为41.37%。

Conclusion: 我们的最佳系统在19个团队和51个提交中排名第三，平均得分为41.37%，这表明轻量级RAG与通用大语言模型——一个最小的推理时间层，通过简单的索引和融合添加几个相关示例，无需额外训练或复杂的重新排序——为多模态临床NLP任务提供了一个简单而有效的基线。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLMs）在代理AI系统中的重要性不断增加，需要更高效的架构来满足需求。

Method: 我们引入了一种高效的语言模型架构，称为ShishuLM，通过减少参数数量和键值（KV）缓存需求来优化模型。

Result: ShishuLM在内存需求上最多减少了25%，在训练和推理期间的延迟上最多提高了40%。

Conclusion: 我们的实验和分析结果为从预训练角度构建更高效的SLM架构提供了见解。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近的研究已经探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在教育环境中的偏见影响，但LLM辅助辅导的情感动态仍不够清楚。因此，本研究旨在引入一种集成LLM框架，以推进将生成式AI负责任地融入教育的讨论，关注学习者的不断变化的情感状态。

Method: 本研究分析了两个学期的16,986个对话回合，这些对话是在PyTutor（一个基于LLM的AI导师）和261名美国大学本科生之间进行的。通过从三个前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）生成零样本情感注释，包括情感评分、唤醒度和学习帮助性评分，以及自由文本情感标签，并通过排名加权模型内聚合和模型间多数共识来融合这些估计，以生成稳健的情感档案。

Result: 分析显示，学生在与AI导师互动时通常报告轻微积极的情绪和中等唤醒度。然而，学习过程并非始终顺利：困惑和好奇心常常伴随问题解决，而挫折虽然较少，但仍可能阻碍进展。情绪状态是短暂的，但积极时刻比中性或消极时刻持续稍长，且容易被破坏。令人鼓舞的是，负面情绪往往很快得到解决，有时会直接反弹到积极状态。中性时刻经常成为转折点，更多地引导学生向上而非向下。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为模板填充（TI）的方法，用于改进扩散语言模型的生成过程。通过生成结构模板并填充被屏蔽的段落，以及引入动态段分配来增强灵活性，该方法在数学推理和代码生成任务中表现出色，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）作为自回归语言模型的有前途的替代方案，但其推理策略仍局限于从自回归范式继承的前缀提示。本文旨在解决这一限制，提出一种新的条件方法以提高DLMs的生成能力。

Method: 我们提出了模板填充（TI），这是一种针对扩散语言模型生成过程的定制化条件方法。与传统的前缀提示不同，TI首先为目标响应生成一个结构模板，然后填充被屏蔽的段落。为了增强这种结构控制的灵活性，我们引入了动态段分配（DSA），根据生成置信度自适应地调整段长度。

Result: 我们在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中验证了我们方法的有效性，取得了比基线高出17.01%的改进。此外，TI在多标记生成设置中提供了额外的优势，能够在保持生成质量的同时实现有效的加速。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中表现出色，实现了比基线高出17.01%的改进。此外，TI在多标记生成设置中提供了额外的优势，能够在保持生成质量的同时实现有效的加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了FRACCO，一个经过专家标注的1301个合成法语临床案例语料库，用于法语肿瘤文本的命名实体识别和概念标准化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于临床文本的自然语言处理工具需要标注数据集，但法语肿瘤资源仍然稀缺。

Method: 通过专家评审确保注释质量，1301个文本由两位领域专家手动标注实体跨度，并通过自动化匹配和人工验证生成71127个ICD-O标准化。

Result: 最终数据集包含399个独特的形态学代码（来自2549种不同的表达），272个解剖学代码（来自3143种不同的表达），以及2043个独特的复合表达（来自11144种不同的表达）。

Conclusion: 该数据集为法语肿瘤文本中的命名实体识别和概念标准化提供了参考标准。

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures
composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different
expressions), and 2043 unique composite expressions (from 11144 different
expressions). This dataset provides a reference standard for named entity
recognition and concept normalisation in French oncology texts.

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种用于解码器仅模型的简单残差流门控机制，能够在保持模型性能的同时显著减少计算成本，并且可以与其他技术如量化、剪枝和自推测解码相结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的早期退出或基于路由器的深度混合模型存在不稳定性和需要大量再训练的问题。因此，需要一种更稳定且易于微调的方法来实现层跳过，以提高模型效率。

Method: GateSkip通过为每个注意力/MLP分支配备一个sigmoid-linear门控来压缩分支输出，从而实现逐标记的层跳过。在推理过程中，根据门控值对标记进行排序，并使用每层预算跳过低重要性的标记。

Result: 在长格式推理任务中，GateSkip可以节省高达15%的计算量，同时保留超过90%的基础模型准确性。在指令调优模型中，GateSkip在全计算量下实现了准确性提升，并在接近50%的计算量节省情况下达到了基础模型的质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip是一种简单且有效的残差流门控机制，能够实现解码器仅模型中的逐标记层跳过。该方法在保持模型性能的同时显著减少了计算成本，并且可以与其他技术如量化、剪枝和自推测解码相结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的基准，用于评估大型语言模型在仅使用自然语言的情况下进行序列决策的能力。结果显示，Qwen3-4B在最佳手臂选择方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在执行推理任务方面表现出色，但它们在仅使用自然语言的情况下进行序列决策的能力仍缺乏探索。

Method: 我们引入了一个新的基准，其中LLMs通过纯文本反馈与多臂老虎机环境互动，而没有访问数值提示或明确的概率。

Result: 我们评估了四种开源LLMs的性能，并将其与标准决策算法（如Thompson Sampling、Epsilon Greedy、Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) 和随机选择）进行了比较。虽然大多数LLMs的表现不如基线，但Qwen3-4B达到了89.2%的最佳手臂选择率，这显著优于更大的LLMs和传统方法。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，仅通过语言就可以产生概率推理，并且我们提出的基准为在非数值环境中评估决策能力提供了一个步骤。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Catch Your Breath的损失函数，使语言模型能够根据需要动态调整计算步骤。实验表明，该模型在较少的训练数据下就能达到与基线模型相当的性能，并能根据上下文和词性智能地决定是否请求额外的计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型通常以固定步数处理每个输入标记，无法根据任务复杂度动态调整计算资源。本文旨在开发一种方法，使模型能够根据需要动态调整计算步骤，从而提高效率和准确性。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的监督训练目标，允许语言模型根据需要动态调整计算步骤。模型通过发出<don't know>输出来请求额外的计算步骤，并使用<pause>标记来提供额外的计算资源。同时，将每个输出标记的选择建模为一个带有时间成本的序列决策问题。

Result: 实验表明，CYB模型在较少的训练数据下就能达到与基线模型相当的性能。此外，模型能够根据上下文和词性智能地决定是否请求额外的计算资源，例如在处理复数名词或模糊标记时更倾向于请求额外计算步骤。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Catch Your Breath（CYB）的损失函数，使语言模型能够根据需要动态调整每个输入标记的计算步骤。实验表明，CYB模型在较少的训练数据下就能达到与基线模型相当的性能，并且能根据上下文和词性智能地决定是否请求额外的计算资源。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

TL;DR: PAGE框架通过使用简单的辅助模块来提高自然语言生成模型的质量和可控性，而无需依赖复杂的辅助生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言生成模型在特定任务或特定要求下可能表现不佳，或者需要大量额外数据进行调整。因此，需要一种方法来改进这些模型的表现，而无需依赖复杂的辅助生成模型。

Method: PAGE（Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement）是一种框架，它通过使用简单的辅助模块来帮助自然语言生成模型。这些模块提供输入文本的推理，并利用这些推理构建增强的输入，以提高生成的质量和可控性。

Result: 该工作提出了PAGE框架，并在需求工程领域进行了概念验证，其中使用了一个带有分类器的辅助模块来提高软件需求生成的质量。

Conclusion: PAGE框架通过使用简单的辅助模块，如分类器或提取器，提供输入文本的推理，从而提高生成质量和可控性。这种方法不需要辅助生成模型，而是提出了一个更简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同的任务。

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张在LLM社会模拟中采用开放性，以更好地捕捉主题、观点和推理过程，从而提高模拟的真实性和方法论的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的研究将模拟限制在多项选择或简答题格式中，但这种封闭设计忽略了LLM本质上生成性的特点。本文认为开放性对于现实的社会模拟是必要的。

Method: 本文基于数十年的调查方法研究和最近的NLP进展，讨论了开放性在LLM社会模拟中的价值。

Result: 开放性可以提高测量和设计，支持探索未预见的观点，并减少研究者强加的指令偏差。它还能捕捉表达力和个性，有助于预测试，并最终增强方法论的实用性。

Conclusion: 本文呼吁采用新的实践和评估框架，以利用而非限制LLM的开放生成多样性，从而在自然语言处理和社会科学之间产生协同效应。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了十种先进的大型语言模型在无结构文本分类任务中的表现，发现它们的性能仅为中等水平。然而，通过模型协作，可以显著提高分类准确性并消除幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估当前大型语言模型在无结构文本分类任务中的性能，并探索如何通过模型协作来改善分类结果。

Method: 本研究对十种最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）进行了比较评估，使用了8,660个经过人工标注的样本和相同的零样本提示，以确保方法的一致性。评估指标包括四个经典指标（准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数）以及三个LLM特定指标（幻觉比率、膨胀比率和分类成本）。

Result: 研究结果显示，尽管LLMs迅速发展，但其在经典指标上的表现仅为中等水平，平均准确率为34%，精确率为42%，召回率为45%，F1分数为41%。此外，模型经常过度生成类别，而GPT 120B表现出最低的幻觉比率。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）迅速发展，但它们在分类任务中的表现仅达到中等水平。此外，研究还表明，通过协调多个模型的协作，可以显著提高分类准确性并消除幻觉现象。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating LLM-generated math proofs by introducing ProofBench and developing ProofGrader, an effective evaluator that outperforms existing methods and shows promise for improving proof generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for LLM-generated math proofs is identified as a critical gap. The goal is to develop an effective evaluator that can assess the quality of generated proofs accurately.

Method: The paper proposes a systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign fine-grained scores to model-generated math proofs. It introduces ProofBench, an expert-annotated dataset, and explores the evaluator design space across key axes such as backbone model, input context, instructions, and evaluation workflow.

Result: ProofGrader, an evaluator combining a strong reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions, and a simple ensembling method, achieves a low MAE of 0.926 against expert scores. It significantly outperforms naive baselines and demonstrates practical utility in a best-of-n selection task.

Conclusion: ProofGrader demonstrates significant potential in advancing downstream proof generation by achieving a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and closing a large gap between naive evaluators and human oracles.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and

generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in adapting LLMs to specialized domains, such as over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited generalization.

Method: THTB (The Harder The Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring, offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in data selection and annotation guidance.

Result: Experiments show that THTB enables models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training, while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection.

Motivation: 现有的防御措施通常专注于单次攻击，缺乏跨语言的覆盖范围，并依赖于有限的分类法，这些分类法要么无法捕捉攻击策略的全部多样性，要么强调风险类别而非越狱技术。为了推进对越狱技术有效性的理解，本文进行了一项结构化的红队挑战。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Motivation: 随着机器生成的文本质量不断提高，确定作者身份变得愈加困难。因此，研究旨在评估不同的归属机制以应对这一挑战。

Method: 研究在Human AI Parallel Corpus数据集上对固定风格嵌入和一个经过指令调优的LLM裁判（GPT-4o）进行了基准测试，该数据集包含600个平衡实例，涵盖六个领域。

Result: 风格嵌入基线在GPT延续上表现出更强的总体准确性（82% vs. 68%），而LLM裁判在LLaMA延续上略优于风格嵌入（85% vs. 81%），但结果不具统计显著性。然而，在小说和学术写作中，LLM裁判明显优于风格嵌入，表明其对语义的敏感性。

Conclusion: 该研究指出，由于大型语言模型生成的文本日益接近人类写作，确定作者身份变得越来越具有挑战性。研究比较了两种互补的归属机制，并强调了需要混合策略来解决这一多维问题。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

TL;DR: 本文研究了狭窄微调对大型语言模型的影响，发现微调会导致模型激活中出现可解释的偏差，并提出了一种基于这些偏差的可解释性代理。研究结果表明，这些偏差可能反映了过拟合现象，并提醒研究人员注意使用这些模型作为研究更广泛微调的代理可能存在的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究狭窄微调对大型语言模型（LLMs）激活的影响，并探索如何利用这些偏差来更好地理解微调领域。

Method: 本文使用模型差异分析工具来研究微调前后模型之间的差异，以发现狭窄微调带来的偏差。同时，还创建了一个基于LLM的可解释性代理来理解微调领域。

Result: 研究发现，狭窄微调会在LLM激活中产生强烈的偏差，这些偏差可以被用来理解微调领域。此外，基于这些偏差的代理在性能上优于基线代理。

Conclusion: 本文表明，通过狭窄微调的模型在激活中具有明显的训练目标痕迹，并提出了改进训练方法的建议。此外，它警告AI安全和可解释性研究人员，使用这些模型作为研究更广泛微调（例如聊天微调）的代理可能不现实，并强调了对狭窄微调的影响进行更深入研究的必要性。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

TL;DR: RAID是一种用于生成绕过LLM安全机制的有效攻击的框架，通过优化嵌入空间中的连续表示，实现高效且自然的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然在各种任务中表现出色，但容易受到jailbreak攻击，这些攻击会绕过安全机制。因此，需要一种方法来系统地探测这些弱点并生成有效的攻击。

Method: RAID框架通过将离散标记转换为连续嵌入，并使用联合目标进行优化，包括鼓励受限响应、引入拒绝感知正则化以引导激活远离拒绝方向，以及应用连贯性项以保持语义合理性和非冗余性。之后，通过批评引导的解码过程将嵌入映射回标记。

Result: RAID在多个开源LLMs上的实验表明，它比最近的白盒和黑盒基线方法在更少的查询和更低的计算成本下实现了更高的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: RAID框架通过优化嵌入空间中的连续表示，能够有效地生成绕过LLM安全机制的攻击，并且具有较低的计算成本。这表明嵌入空间正则化在理解和减轻LLM jailbreak漏洞方面的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了LLM在道德基础理论框架下的响应，调查了它们是否表现出意识形态倾向，并评估了它们在不同条件下的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在医疗、人际关系和法律等领域的角色日益重要，因此需要了解它们在困难的政治和道德领域中的响应方式和可能的偏见。

Method: 本研究分析了LLM的MFT响应与现有人类研究之间的差异，调查了常见可用的LLM响应是否表现出意识形态倾向。

Result: 本研究发现LLM的响应可能表现出意识形态倾向，并且能够通过明确提示和基于人口统计的角色扮演来准确代表意识形态观点。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了关于AI生成响应中政治和人口统计依赖性的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SA-ICL is a framework that uses schema-based learning to enhance the reasoning process of large language models, showing significant improvements in performance on chemistry and physics questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science, specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL).

Method: SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL) extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when presented with a novel question.

Result: Our experiments show that SA-ICL consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: SA-ICL not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: PDO is a label-free prompt optimization framework that uses pairwise preference feedback from an LLM judge and combines Double Thompson Sampling with Top-Performer Guided Mutation to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts, making prompt design a central challenge. Most approaches assume access to ground-truth references, but collecting high-quality labels is costly and slow.

Method: PDO formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. It combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS) with Top-Performer Guided Mutation.

Result: Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Conclusion: PDO consistently outperforms baseline methods in label-free prompt optimization and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型是否在其内部表示中编码运算符优先级。我们使用LLaMA 3.2-3B模型分析了算术表达式，并发现中间计算出现在残差流中。我们还发现模型在线性编码每个运算符的嵌入后注意层，并引入了一种修改运算符优先级的技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）已经展示了令人印象深刻的推理能力，但仍然在算术任务上遇到困难。先前的工作主要关注输出或提示策略，而关于模型如何进行算术计算的内部结构的问题仍然是开放的。

Method: 我们构建了一个包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，变化了括号的顺序和位置。使用这个数据集，我们追踪了指令调优的LLaMA 3.2-3B模型的残差流中是否出现中间结果。我们应用了可解释性技术，如logit lens、线性分类探测器和UMAP几何可视化。

Result: 我们的结果表明，中间计算出现在残差流中，特别是在MLP块之后。我们还发现，模型在线性编码每个运算符的嵌入后注意层。我们引入了部分嵌入交换技术，通过交换高影响嵌入维度来修改运算符优先级。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，中间计算出现在残差流中，特别是在MLP块之后。我们还发现，模型在线性编码每个运算符的嵌入后注意层。我们引入了部分嵌入交换技术，通过交换高影响嵌入维度来修改运算符优先级。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种知识推理语言模型（KRLM），旨在解决LLM在归纳知识图谱推理中的知识失真和生成幻觉问题。通过设计KRL指令格式、KRL分词器、KRL注意力层和结构感知的下一个实体预测器，KRLM实现了LLM知识和KG上下文的统一协调，并在多个数据集上取得了显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM-based KGR方法仍然难以完全约束LLM的生成幻觉，严重限制了推理结果的可信度。此外，LLM的内在知识可能被稀疏的KG上下文所掩盖，导致LLM知识失真，这可能对模型推理造成不可逆的损害。

Method: 提出了一种知识推理语言模型（KRLM），实现了LLM知识和KG上下文在整个KGR过程中的统一协调。设计了KRL指令格式和KRL分词器，以对齐LLM知识与KG表示。提出了KRL注意力层，通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识与额外的KG上下文。最后，提出了一种结构感知的下一个实体预测器，严格限制推理结果在可信的知识领域内。

Result: KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景中均表现出显著的优势。

Conclusion: KRLM在25个现实世界的归纳KGR数据集上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明其显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理RAG系统在处理复杂的多跳问题时仍然存在困难，其中间推理能力仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 我们提出了RAGCap-Bench，这是一个面向能力的基准，用于对代理RAG工作流中的中间任务进行细粒度评估。我们分析了最先进的系统的输出，以确定常见的任务和执行它们所需的核心能力，然后构建了一个典型的LLM错误分类，以设计针对性的评估问题。

Conclusion: 实验表明，具有更强RAGCap性能的“慢思考”模型能够取得更好的端到端结果，这证明了基准的有效性，并强调了增强这些中间能力的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文研究了辩论作为可扩展监督技术的应用，特别是在主观问题上的应用。结果显示，模型倾向于捍卫与裁判角色一致的立场，而不是他们的先验信念，顺序辩论引入了偏差，且与先验信念不一致的论点在成对比较中被评定为更高品质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辩论实验依赖于具有真实数据集的地面真相，其中说谎被简化为捍卫错误的命题。这忽略了主观维度：说谎还需要相信所捍卫的主张是虚假的。本文旨在将辩论应用于主观问题，并明确测量大型语言模型的先验信念。

Method: 我们将辩论应用于主观问题，并在实验前明确测量大型语言模型的先验信念。辩手被要求选择他们偏好的立场，然后被呈现一个与他们确定的先验信念冲突的裁判角色。这种设置测试了模型是否会采用奉承策略，以最大化说服力，或者忠于他们的先验信念。我们实施并比较了两种辩论协议，顺序和同时，以评估潜在的系统性偏差。最后，我们评估了当捍卫与先验信念一致的立场时，模型是否更具说服力并产生更高品质的论点，或者当与之对抗时。

Result: 模型倾向于捍卫与裁判角色一致的立场，而不是他们的先验信念。顺序辩论引入了有利于第二辩手的显著偏差。当捍卫与先验信念一致的立场时，模型更具说服力，但与先验信念不一致的论点在成对比较中被评定为更高品质。

Conclusion: 模型倾向于捍卫与裁判角色一致的立场，而不是他们的先验信念。顺序辩论引入了有利于第二辩手的显著偏差。当捍卫与先验信念一致的立场时，模型更具说服力，但与先验信念不一致的论点在成对比较中被评定为更高品质。这些结果可以为人类裁判提供更高质量的训练信号，并有助于更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的人机交互重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Motivation: 现有的方法通常缺乏对难度和质量的细粒度控制，产生的合成数据无法捕捉长期推理所需的复杂性。此外，许多研究将数据和训练效果混为一谈，难以单独评估数据本身的有效性。

Method: 我们引入了一个双管齐下的数据合成管道，通过逐步增加任务复杂度直到一个前沿基线网络代理失败来生成问题-答案对。基线代理在这个过程中扮演多个角色：尝试问题、验证事实性、检查替代答案并强制过滤。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管我们的数据集规模较小，但它能够训练出比现有数据集更有效的网络代理。此外，我们的数据在工具使用动作上表现出更高的多样性，使模型能够实现更强的性能，同时避免重复的工具调用行为。

Conclusion: 我们的数据集尽管规模较小，但能够训练出比现有数据集更有效的网络代理。特别是，我们的数据在工具使用动作上表现出两倍的多样性，使基于它的模型能够实现更强的性能，同时避免重复的工具调用行为。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Motivation: 先前的研究认为可读性是小型语言模型产生连贯文本的关键因素，但我们质疑这一观点，并希望找出真正影响模型学习能力的因素。

Method: 我们构建了结构相同但可读性不同的合成数据集，并通过比较模型在不同数据集上的表现来验证可读性和统计简单性的预测能力。

Result: 模型在复杂成人文本上的表现与在简化语言上的表现相当，甚至在训练过程中表现出更快的连贯性发展。统计简单性（如n-gram多样性）是更好的预测因素。

Conclusion: 我们的发现警示了将语言模型训练拟人化的趋势，并主张更精确地推理哪些特性实际上支持小型模型的能力出现。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Result: 尽管元素间关系复杂且存在计算挑战，但通过生成通用嵌入和属性突出向量，以及使用基于自注意力的测试时训练方法，可以有效减轻预测误差。

Conclusion: 本文希望为材料科学中的AI驱动发现铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for

a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于理论框架的PRM校准方法，以提高测试时缩放的效率，证明了智能聚合策略比单纯增加计算量更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试表明，简单的多数投票有时会优于标准的PRM-based选择，这引发了如何有效利用PRM的验证信号的问题。

Method: 我们开发了一个理论框架，用于最优地结合来自LLM和PRM的信号，并提出了高效的预计算方法来校准这些权重函数。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRMs上的广泛实验表明，我们的校准方法显著提高了TTS效率，超过了原始加权多数投票的效果，仅使用了21.3%的计算量。

Conclusion: 我们的工作表明，投资于更智能的聚合策略可以比单纯扩展测试时计算更能带来性能提升。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

*Ye Yuan,Mohammad Amin Shabani,Siqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTS is a new approach for query-focused table summarization that uses offline templates to improve speed, accuracy, and privacy compliance, and it outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for query-focused table summarization face limitations such as costly fine-tuning, token-limit issues, inefficiency, and exposure of sensitive data. Prior agentic pipelines also lack robustness and scalability.

Method: FACTS introduces an agentic workflow for fast, accurate, and privacy-compliant table summarization via offline template generation, which includes SQL queries and Jinja2 templates.

Result: Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: FACTS consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的AI代理框架，用于物联网网络流量的全面且高效的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从物联网网络流量中获取有意义的见解需要跨层的行为、协议和上下文解释，而不是孤立检测。

Method: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的AI代理框架，将原始数据包捕获转换为结构化和语义丰富的表示形式，用于交互式分析。

Result: 实验评估表明，混合检索（结合词法和语义搜索与重新排序）显著提高了BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR和BERTScore的结果。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了对物联网网络流量的全面且高效的解释，具有低CPU、GPU和内存开销。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

*Congying Liu,Xingyuan Wei,Peipei Liu,Yiqing Shen,Yanxu Mao,Tiehan Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioMedSearch is a framework that enhances the accuracy of answering complex biomedical queries by integrating multiple data sources and using advanced information retrieval techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of LLMs in generating scientifically rigorous biomedical content due to their inability to access authoritative biomedical databases and their tendency to fabricate inaccurate information.

Method: BioMedSearch is a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework based on LLMs. It integrates literature retrieval, protein database and web search access, and uses sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction, task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering to generate high-quality question-answering results.

Result: BioMedSearch significantly improves accuracy in answering complex biomedical queries across three levels of reasoning: mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal causal reasoning. The results show improvements from 59.1% to 91.9% at Level 1, 47.0% to 81.0% at Level 2, and 36.3% to 73.4% at Level 3.

Conclusion: BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all levels of reasoning, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex biomedical queries.

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and
BioMedMCQs are available at: https://github.com/CyL-ucas/BioMed_Search

TL;DR: 研究发现持续暴露于垃圾网络文本会导致大型语言模型的认知衰退，数据质量是影响LLM能力的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究持续暴露于垃圾网络文本是否会导致大型语言模型（LLMs）的长期认知衰退。

Method: 通过两个正交的操作化方式（M1和M2）构建垃圾和反向控制数据集，进行受控实验以隔离数据质量的影响。

Result: 在垃圾数据集上持续预训练4个LLMs导致推理、长上下文理解、安全性和“黑暗特质”（如反社会人格、自恋）的非微小下降。混合垃圾和控制数据集也显示出剂量反应的认知衰减。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力下降的因果驱动因素，这重新定义了持续预训练的整理问题，并促使对部署的LLM进行常规的“认知健康检查”。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型是否在不良事件（AE）预测中纳入社会人口信息，尽管这些属性在临床上无关。

Method: 使用来自美国食品药品管理局不良事件报告系统（FAERS）的结构化数据和基于人物的评估框架，评估了两种最先进的模型ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B。

Result: 研究结果揭示了在AE预测准确性上的系统性差异，弱势群体（如低教育水平、住房不稳定）被分配到更高的预测AE可能性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大型语言模型在药物安全性预测中的系统性偏差，强调了在临床部署前需要公平意识评估协议和缓解策略的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在需要多步骤推理或领域特定知识的任务上表现不佳，因此需要一种方法来改善它们的表现。

Method: 通过构建指令语料库，将相似的训练问题分组，并使用GPT-5创建指令。在推理过程中，小型语言模型检索最相关的指令并遵循其步骤。

Result: 在MedQA、MMLU Professional Law和MathQA数据集上，指令检索带来了显著的提升，分别提高了9.4%、7.9%和5.1%。

Conclusion: 通过在推理时进行指令干预，可以提高小型语言模型在需要多步骤推理或领域特定知识的任务上的表现。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Conclusion: 本文提出了HisRubric评估框架和FinDeepResearch基准，以系统评估DR代理在企业财务分析中的能力，并揭示了不同方法的优缺点，为未来的研究和开发提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过对单个作者的作品进行微调，AI生成的文本在风格和质量上优于专业人类写作，这可能对版权法中的合理使用因素产生影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI模型使用受版权保护的书籍进行训练引发了大量诉讼，作者担心AI生成衍生内容的能力。然而，不清楚这些模型是否能生成高质量的文学文本并模仿作者的风格。

Method: 进行了一项预注册研究，比较了MFA训练的专家作家与三个前沿AI模型（ChatGPT、Claude和Gemini）在模仿50位获奖作者风格方面的能力。通过盲测配对评估，分析了AI生成文本的质量和风格忠实度。

Result: 在上下文提示下，AI生成的文本被专家强烈不喜欢，但在对单个作者的作品进行微调后，专家现在更喜欢AI生成的文本。此外，微调后的输出很少被AI检测器标记为AI生成。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使AI写作在风格和质量上优于专业人类写作，这为版权法中的合理使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

Motivation: 研究发现推理不确定性主要集中在高熵标记上，这启发了MTI的提出。

Method: MTI包括选择性CFG干预和轻量级负提示引导，通过在不确定位置应用分类器无关指导以及重用主模型的KV缓存来近似无条件解码。

Result: MTI在通用、编程和STEM任务中均取得了显著提升，例如Qwen3-8B-Base在八个基准测试中平均提高了1.35%，而Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提高了5%。

Conclusion: MTI在多个任务中表现出色，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural contexts, as correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding.

Method: CRaFT is an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework that evaluates model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency, Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. It was applied to 50 culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluated three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs.

Result: Results reveal significant cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid reasoning.

Conclusion: CRaFT offers a new lens for evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

*César Guerra-Solano,Zhuochun Li,Xiang Lorraine Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型在不同语言中的推理能力偏差，特别是在抽象推理任务中。研究发现英语模态通常表现更好，并且开放源代码和封闭源代码模型之间存在性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数以前的工作通过需要依赖策略或知识的推理任务来评估这一点，例如常识或数学任务。然而，抽象推理对于日常生活中的推理至关重要，人们应用“跳出框框的思考”来识别和使用模式以解决问题，而不依赖公式化的方法。相比之下，很少有工作评估这种任务类型的语言偏见。

Method: 本文提出了一项受纽约时报Connections: GlobalGroup启发的任务，用于在多种语言中评估模型的抽象推理能力。构建了一个游戏基准测试，包括五种语言背景（英语、西班牙语、中文、印地语和阿拉伯语），并在原生语言和英语翻译中进行比较。还提出了游戏难度测量方法，以评估模型在相似难度的游戏中的表现，从而实现更受控的比较。

Result: 研究发现英语模态在这一抽象推理任务中通常导致更好的表现，并且开放源代码和封闭源代码模型之间存在性能差异。

Conclusion: 研究发现英语模态在这一抽象推理任务中通常导致更好的表现，并且开放源代码和封闭源代码模型之间存在性能差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨语音和语义之间的系统关系在大规模定量研究中能有多显著，包括已知和未知的现象。

Method: 该研究采用分布方法，在6种不同的语言（英语、西班牙语、印地语、芬兰语、土耳其语和泰米尔语）中分析了词素的语音和语义相似性空间，并使用一套统计测量方法进行量化。

Result: 研究发现了之前未被识别的语音语义对齐，并找到了一些已知假设的支持和混合结果。

Conclusion: 该研究发现了一些之前未在文献中记录的可解释的语音语义对齐，以及跨语言模式，并对一些已有的假设进行了验证。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ERGO is a method that uses entropy to detect and handle uncertainty in multi-turn conversations, leading to improved performance and reliability in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally, which poses a severe challenge to real world usability.

Method: ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for Generation Optimization) continuously quantifies internal uncertainty via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected.

Result: In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases aptitude by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability by 35.3%.

Conclusion: ERGO demonstrates that uncertainty-aware interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

*Wael Rashwan,Hossam M. Zawbaa,Sourav Dutta,Haytham Assem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DROID的紧凑端到端框架，用于检测超出范围的用户话语。它结合了两个互补的编码器，并通过一个轻量级分支分类器进行处理，以实现高效的OOS检测。DROID在多个基准测试中表现优于最先进的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测超出范围（OOS）用户话语仍然是任务导向对话系统和更广泛地开放集意图识别中的关键挑战。现有方法通常依赖于强大的分布假设或辅助校准模块。

Method: DROID（Dual Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection）是一种紧凑的端到端框架，结合了两个互补的编码器——通用句子编码器（USE）用于广泛的语义泛化，以及领域适应的基于Transformer的去噪自编码器（TSDAE）用于领域特定的上下文区分。它们的融合表示由一个轻量级分支分类器处理，该分类器具有单个校准阈值，可以将域内和OOS意图分开，而无需后期评分。

Result: 尽管只使用了1.5M可训练参数，DROID在多个意图基准测试中始终优于最近的最先进基线，对于已知意图的宏-F1改进了6-15%，对于OOS意图的宏-F1改进了8-20%，在低资源环境中取得了最大的收益。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，具有简单校准的双编码器表示可以为神经对话系统提供稳健、可扩展和可靠的OOS检测。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

normalization. An exploratory analysis of ingredient frequency and
co-occurrence patterns, using measures such as Pointwise Mutual Information and
Lift score, highlights distinctive ingredient combinations that characterize
Macedonian cuisine. The resulting dataset contributes a new resource for
studying food culture in underrepresented languages and offers insights into
the unique patterns of Macedonian culinary tradition.

### [70] [RLSR: Reinforcement Learning with Supervised Reward Outperforms SFT in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14200)
*Zhichao Wang,Andy Wong,Ruslan Belkin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

*Bingsheng Yao,Bo Sun,Yuanzhe Dong,Yuxuan Lu,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种动态人格优化框架（DPRF），用于提高大型语言模型角色扮演代理的行为一致性，并验证了其在多个场景中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型角色扮演代理（LLM RPAs）的人格保真度常常受到手动创建的档案的破坏，这些档案没有验证与目标个体的一致性。

Method: 我们引入了动态人格优化框架（DPRF），该框架通过迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的认知差异，并优化人格档案以减轻这些差异。

Result: 我们在四个不同的行为预测场景中评估了DPRF，结果表明DPRF可以显著提高行为一致性，并在不同模型和场景中具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了一种稳健的方法，用于创建高保真的人格档案，并增强了下游应用的有效性，例如用户模拟、社会研究和个性化AI。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一种用于多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过离线搜索和在线置信度生成提前退出来提高效率，同时保持较高的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应加速技术在多阶段推理中难以平衡效率和准确性，因为存在两个关键挑战：阶段性的跳过敏感性变化和冗余输出标记的生成。

Method: LiteStage结合了阶段性的离线搜索和基于置信度的生成提前退出，以抑制不必要的解码。

Result: LiteStage在三个基准测试（如OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA）中实现了高达1.70倍的加速，且准确率损失小于4.0%。

Conclusion: LiteStage在三个基准测试中表现出色，实现了高达1.70倍的加速，且准确率损失小于4.0%，优于之前的无训练层跳过方法。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

*Parsa Hejabi,Elnaz Rahmati,Alireza S. Ziabari,Morteza Dehghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了F^2C，这是一种无监督训练方法，用于提高大型语言模型在提示扰动下的鲁棒性。通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失，F^2C显著提升了模型的一致性、性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在面对同一提示的不同表述时，常常产生不一致的答案。本文旨在提出一种无监督训练方法，以提高对这些扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: F^2C由两个关键组件组成：共识交叉熵（CCE）和表示对齐损失。CCE使用提示变化的多数投票来创建硬伪标签，而表示对齐损失则将低置信度和非多数预测器拉向高置信度、多数投票的变化所建立的共识。

Result: 在11个数据集上评估了该方法，每个数据集有4-15个提示变化。平均而言，F^2C提高了观察到的一致性11.62%，提高了平均F1分数8.94%，并减少了不同格式之间的性能方差3.29%。在域外评估中，F^2C表现出良好的泛化能力，提高了F1分数和一致性，同时减少了大多数源目标对的方差。当仅在部分提示扰动上进行训练并在保留格式上进行评估时，F^2C始终提高了性能和一致性，同时减少了方差。

Conclusion: F^2C是一种有效的无监督方法，可以增强LLM在提示扰动下的一致性、性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在知识内化和推理能力方面存在局限，因此需要一种更有效的文档处理方法。

Method: MoM框架通过主动理解文档内容，模拟人类阅读过程，采用多路径采样和多视角评估机制，结合反向推理策略，构建了三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，MoM框架能够提供语义完整的文档记忆，并提升了小语言模型的文本处理能力。

Conclusion: MoM框架不仅解决了现有RAG系统中的文本分块挑战，还为小语言模型（SLMs）实现了以人类为中心的智能文本处理铺平了道路。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了测试训练数据如何影响模型行为，我们需要一种系统的方法来干预数据并重新训练模型。

Method: 我们提出了一个实验配方，用于研究训练数据和语言模型（LM）行为之间的关系。我们描述了对数据批次进行干预的步骤，并在这些数据上重新训练模型检查点以测试与数据相关的假设。我们的配方将这种干预分解为几个阶段，包括从衡量模型行为的基准中选择评估项目，匹配相关文档到这些项目，并在重新训练和测量效果之前修改这些文档。

Result: 我们的结果补充了过去观察性分析，这些分析将共现与模型行为联系起来，同时表明现有的识别相关训练文档的方法并不能完全解释LM正确回答知识问题的能力。

Conclusion: 我们概述了一种可以遵循的实验配方，以测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的进一步假设。我们的代码已公开，以促进未来的工作。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Motivation: 训练有效的多语言嵌入模型面临独特的挑战，因为语言和任务目标的多样性。虽然小型多语言模型在多语言任务上表现良好，但在最普遍的用例（即检索）中，它们始终落后于大型模型。因此，我们需要确定是否可以通过专门针对检索任务进行改造来提高小型模型的性能。

Method: 我们研究了影响多语言嵌入有效性的关键因素，包括训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性。

Result: 我们发现增加训练数据规模会带来初始性能提升，但这些改进很快达到饱和，表明收益递减。引入困难的负样本对于持续提高检索准确性至关重要。此外，我们的分析显示，训练数据中的任务多样性比语言多样性对性能的影响更大。

Conclusion: 我们开发了一个紧凑的（约3亿参数）多语言模型，其检索性能可以与当前强大的7B模型相媲美甚至超越。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

TL;DR: Qwen3Guard is a series of multilingual safety guardrail models that address the limitations of existing guardrail models by enabling fine-grained tri-class judgments and real-time safety monitoring during incremental text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrail models face limitations in real-world applications, such as providing only binary 'safe/unsafe' labels and requiring complete model outputs before performing safety checks, making them incompatible with streaming LLM inference.

Method: Qwen3Guard introduces two specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments, and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during incremental text generation.

Result: Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response safety classification across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks.

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard provides comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM deployments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于代理的检索系统，用于多跳问题回答，能够在四个基准测试中超越强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问题回答需要收集多个证据片段，因此需要高效的检索系统。

Method: 我们引入了一个基于结构化循环的代理检索系统，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）来以高精度和召回率检索相关证据。框架包括三个专门的代理：问题分析器、选择器和添加器。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在四个多跳QA基准测试中表现出色，能够超越强基线。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在四个多跳QA基准测试中 consistently 超过强基线。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模式链接框架，通过改进模式检索来提高Text-to-SQL系统的准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要关注SQL生成，但常常忽视相关模式元素的检索，这可能导致幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 我们提出了一种上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接视为一个独立的问题。该方法结合了两种互补策略：表优先检索后跟列选择，以及列优先检索后跟表选择。

Result: 我们在BIRD和Spider等具有挑战性的基准上进行了全面评估，结果表明我们的方法显著提高了模式召回率，同时减少了假阳性。使用我们检索到的模式进行SQL生成表现优于全模式基线，并接近于理想性能。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了模式链接在提高Text-to-SQL准确性和效率方面的潜力。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于提示工程的关键概念路径分析方法，通过微调Qwen和DeepSeek模型，显著提高了准确率，并将模型公开在Hugging Face平台上。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要集中在英语或高资源语言上，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理的全面评估。

Method: 引入了MathMist，一个平行多语言基准测试，用于评估数学问题解决和推理能力。

Result: 系统评估了多种模型，包括开源小型和中型LLM、专有系统以及专注于多语言推理的模型，在零样本、思维链（CoT）和代码切换推理范式下的表现。

Conclusion: 研究发现，大型语言模型在跨语言数学推理方面仍存在明显不足，尤其是在低资源语言环境中表现更差。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

<details>

Motivation: LLM在对话中可能产生欺骗性输出，这带来了严重的安全问题。需要一种有效的方法来评估和减轻这种欺骗行为。

Method: 本文提出了belief misalignment度量来量化欺骗，并使用五种现有的欺骗检测度量和所提出的度量来评估欺骗。此外，还引入了一种多轮强化学习方法来微调LLM以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗度量与人类判断的相关性比现有度量更高。评估了八种最先进的模型，发现LLM在大约26%的对话回合中自然表现出欺骗行为。当被提示欺骗时，LLM可以将欺骗性提高多达31%。RLHF训练的模型仍然表现出43%的欺骗率。通过多轮强化学习方法，欺骗行为减少了77.6%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种衡量对话中欺骗行为的新指标，并展示了通过多轮强化学习方法可以显著减少LLM的欺骗行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

Motivation: 早期检测阿尔茨海默病对患者有益，可以减轻症状并降低医疗负担。语言能力变化是AD的一个重要迹象，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 使用混合词嵌入和微调超参数的分类方法，结合Doc2Vec和ELMo的词向量生成困惑度分数，并添加语言特征以分析语法和语义。

Result: 实现了91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC，在区分早期AD和健康受试者方面优于现有的最佳NLP模型。

Conclusion: 该模型可以作为阿尔茨海默病的大规模筛查方法，也可以作为医生检测阿尔茨海默病的辅助检查。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

TL;DR: 研究提出了Beyond One World基准，用于评估大型语言模型在角色扮演任务中的表现。该基准包含两个任务：Canon Events和Moral Dilemmas，并引入了Think-Act Matching度量来评估模型的可信度。实验发现，链式思维提示可以提高弱模型的叙事连贯性，但会降低强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍然是一个主要障碍；模型通常在思考或行动方面表现出色，但很少两者兼备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents, yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes -- remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes.

Method: We introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation ('thinking') from outward decisions ('acting'). We further propose Think-Act Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness.

Result: Experiments across reasoning- and non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either thinking or acting, but rarely both.

Conclusion: Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

Motivation: 高性能的医疗大型语言模型通常需要大量的微调和计算资源，这限制了资源有限的医疗机构的访问。因此，需要一种不需要微调的方法来提高医疗问答性能。

Method: 本研究引入了一种基于置信度的多模型框架，利用模型多样性来增强医疗问答能力而无需微调。该框架采用两阶段架构：一个置信度检测模块评估主模型的确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询引导至具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Result: 尽管有强烈的混淆，显著降低了信噪比，许多LLMs仍然保持了显著的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了LLMs在低级层面的鲁棒性，这可能对它们的滥用风险和在各种应用中的可靠性产生影响。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent

insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

### [90] [PluriHop: Exhaustive, Recall-Sensitive QA over Distractor-Rich Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14377)
*Mykolas Sveistrys,Richard Kunert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PluriHopWIND, a dataset for pluri-hop questions in recurring report data, and proposes PluriHopRAG, an improved RAG architecture that achieves significant F1 score improvements through exhaustive retrieval and early filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many realistic questions about recurring report data require aggregation across all documents, with no clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness.

Method: We propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a 'check all documents individually, filter cheaply' approach: it decomposes queries into document-level subquestions and uses a cross-encoder filter to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning.

Result: PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora.

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful alternative to top-k methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

*Jun Li,Qun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析评论树数据，提高了对用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力，为早期自杀干预提供了新的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的研究已经提供了关于检测个体社交媒体帖子中自杀表达的有价值见解，但很少关注纵向、序列评论树的分析以预测用户逐渐变化的自杀风险。然而，用户通常会通过随时间推移的历史帖子和互动评论来揭示他们的意图。

Method: 本研究构建了一个高质量的注释数据集，来源于Reddit，结合了用户的发帖历史和评论，并使用基于C-SSRS的改进四标签注释框架。此外，还进行了统计分析和大型语言模型实验。

Result: 统计数据和大型语言模型实验的结果表明，结合评论树数据显著提高了对用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了关于增强高风险个体检测准确性的新见解，为早期自杀干预策略提供了有价值的基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Method: 本文通过控制的人机对话建模用户的精确用词选择，并构建了一个多语言基准数据集，包含英语、日语和汉语的100个对话会话。

Result: 本文评估了基于提示和微调的个性化方法，建立了第一个YNTP基准，并为用户对齐的语言建模奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 本文提出了YNTP任务，通过控制的人机对话建模用户的精确用词选择，并构建了一个多语言基准数据集。评估了基于提示和微调的个性化方法，建立了第一个YNTP基准，并为用户对齐的语言建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG 的框架，以增强生物医学问答中的事实一致性和减少幻觉现象，并在多个数据集上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG 基础方法在生物医学 QA 中由于后检索噪声和检索证据不足的验证而存在幻觉问题，影响了回答的可靠性。

Method: 我们提出了 MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG 框架，该框架通过三种关键创新来增强事实一致性并减轻医学 QA 中的幻觉现象：1) 强制引用意识推理，要求所有生成内容明确基于检索到的医学文献；2) 采用迭代检索-验证过程，其中验证代理评估证据充分性并通过医学差距分析改进查询；3) 集成 MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)，结合验证的正例与幻觉感知的负样本，利用直接偏好优化强化引用基础推理并惩罚易产生幻觉的响应模式。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在 MedMCQA、MedQA 和 MMLU-Med 上均优于竞争基线，取得了最佳平均准确率，分别提升了 2.7% 和 2.4%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个模型架构上 consistently 超过竞争基线，实现了最佳平均准确率，对于 LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct 和 Qwen3-8B 分别提高了 2.7% 和 2.4%。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需外部监督的自监督强化学习框架，有效解决了多约束任务中的奖励稀疏问题，并在多个数据集上取得了显著成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法依赖于外部监督和稀疏的奖励信号，难以处理多约束任务。

Method: 我们提出了一种无需外部监督的自监督强化学习框架，通过直接从指令中获取奖励信号并生成伪标签用于奖励模型训练。此外，我们引入了约束分解策略和高效的约束级二分类方法。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在3个领域内和5个领域外的数据集上均取得了显著提升，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令遵循任务。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个领域和跨域数据集上表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

TL;DR: NLT is a framework that enhances tool calling in LLMs by using natural language outputs, leading to improved accuracy and reduced variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call performance in LLMs.

Method: NLT replaces programmatic JSON tool calling in LLMs with natural language outputs, decoupling tool selection from response generation.

Result: NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4 percentage points and reduces output variance by 70% across 10 models and 6,400 trials in customer service and mental health domains.

Conclusion: NLT improves tool calling accuracy and reduces output variance, with significant benefits for open-weight models and potential implications for model training.

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

*Haolin Li,Haipeng Zhang,Mang Li,Yaohua Wang,Lijie Wen,Yu Zhang,Biqing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiRA 是一种用于提升低资源语言性能的训练框架，包含 Arca 和 LaSR 两个模块，分别用于锚定低资源语言到英语语义空间并增强推理能力。实验表明 LiRA 在多个低资源任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，高资源语言（如英语、中文）的性能已接近饱和，但低资源语言（如乌尔都语、泰语）的性能仍较低，这是由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声以及跨语言对齐不稳定所致。因此，需要一种能够有效提升低资源语言表现的训练框架。

Method: LiRA 包含两个模块：(i) Arca（基于锚点的表示组合架构），通过基于锚点的对齐和多智能体协作编码，将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间，保持共享嵌入空间中的几何稳定性；(ii) LaSR（语言耦合语义推理器），在 Arca 的多语言表示基础上添加一个语言感知的轻量级推理头，并进行一致性正则化，统一训练目标以增强跨语言理解、检索和推理的鲁棒性。

Result: LiRA 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似性和推理）中表现出一致的性能提升和鲁棒性，特别是在少样本和噪声增强的设置下。消融实验验证了 Arca 和 LaSR 的贡献。

Conclusion: LiRA 是一种有效的训练框架，可以在低资源条件下显著提升跨语言表示，同时增强检索和推理能力。实验表明，在少样本和噪声增强的设置下，LiRA 在多个低资源基准测试中表现出一致的性能提升和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

Motivation: seq2seq共指模型引入了一种新的共指解析范式，通过学习生成对应于共指标签的文本，而不需要任务特定的参数。虽然这些模型实现了新的最先进的性能，但它们是以灵活性和效率为代价的。特别是，它们不能有效地处理像对话这样的增量设置，其中必须顺序处理文本。

Method: 我们提出了一种压缩表示方法，以在增量设置中提高这些方法的效率。我们的方法通过提取和重新组织实体级标记，并丢弃大部分其他输入标记来工作。

Result: 在OntoNotes上，我们的最佳模型仅比全前缀、增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1点，同时实现了1.8的压缩比。在LitBank上，其中单例提及被注释，它达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，在seq2seq解析器中丢弃大量标记是一种可行的策略，用于增量共指解析。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

TL;DR: 本文研究了主权大语言模型在社会文化契合度和技术稳健性方面的评估，发现它们在支持低资源语言方面有一定作用，但不一定能很好地服务于目标用户，且可能低估安全等关键属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球对主权大语言模型的辩论突显了政府开发符合其独特社会文化历史背景的大语言模型的必要性。然而，目前缺乏框架和数据集来验证两个关键问题：(1) 这些模型在多大程度上与用户的社会文化背景相契合，以及 (2) 它们在不使用户暴露于潜在危害和风险的情况下是否保持安全和技术稳健性。

Method: 我们构建了一个新的数据集，并引入了一个分析框架，用于提取和评估主权大语言模型的社会文化元素，以及对其技术稳健性的评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然主权大语言模型在支持低资源语言方面发挥了重要作用，但它们并不总是满足这些模型能很好地服务于目标用户的流行说法。我们还表明，追求这一未经验证的说法可能导致低估安全等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，推进主权大语言模型需要更全面的评估，包括更广泛、有根据和实际的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误，而非捕捉主观质量偏好，生成奖励模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但在去除客观质量信号时性能显著下降，需要一种更有效的偏好建模方法。

Method: 引入了WritingPreferenceBench数据集，比较了序列奖励模型、零样本语言模型法官和生成奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型在WritingPreferenceBench上的平均准确率为52.7%，零样本语言模型法官为53.9%，而生成奖励模型达到81.8%。模型在不同写作类别中的准确性差异很大，且模型规模并未带来一致的提升。

Conclusion: 当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误，而不是捕捉主观质量偏好，成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的归纳数据主要关注表面规律，而缺乏更复杂的内部模式。当前的工作仅提示LLMs或在简单的提示-响应对上进行微调，但没有提供精确的思考过程或实现难度控制。

Method: 我们引入了CodeSeq，这是一个从数字序列构建的合成后训练数据集。我们将数字序列打包成算法问题以发现其通项，并相应地定义了一个通项生成（GTG）任务。我们的管道通过反思失败的测试用例并结合迭代修正来生成监督微调数据，从而教LLMs学习自主案例生成和自我检查。此外，它利用了一种基于可解性（从问题通过率估计）和自导向案例生成成功率的新Case-Synergy Solvability Scaling奖励的强化学习，使模型能够更有效地从成功和失败中学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用CodeSeq训练的模型在各种推理任务中有所改进，并且可以保持模型的OOD性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，使用CodeSeq训练的模型在各种推理任务中有所改进，并且可以保持模型的OOD性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

*Qing Yang,Zhenghao Liu,Junxin Wang,Yangfan Du,Pengcheng Huang,Tong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RLAIF-SPA的框架，通过结合强化学习、自动语音识别和大型语言模型技术，提高了文本到语音合成的情感表达和可理解性。实验结果表明，该框架在多个指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到语音合成方法通常依赖于昂贵的情感注释或优化间接目标，无法捕捉语音的情感表达和感知自然度，导致生成的语音准确但情感平淡。

Method: RLAIF-SPA框架结合了从AI反馈中进行强化学习（RLAIF）机制，利用自动语音识别（ASR）和大型语言模型（LLM）技术分别判断语义准确性和韵律-情感标签对齐，作为情感表达和可理解性优化的直接奖励。

Result: RLAIF-SPA框架在Libri Speech数据集上表现出色，相较于Chat-TTS，在多个指标上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架在Libri Speech数据集上的实验结果表明，它优于Chat-TTS，减少了26.1%的WER，增加了9.1%的SIM-O，并在人类评估中提升了超过10%。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练且无需标签的意图聚类方法，利用轻量级和开源LLM生成伪标签，并通过多标签分类进行聚类，效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现有方法依赖于商业LLM，成本高且透明度有限，且通常需要预先知道聚类数量，这在现实场景中并不总是可行。

Method: 我们首先让LLM为每段文本生成伪标签，然后对每段文本在这个伪标签集中进行多标签分类。

Result: 我们的方法在四个基准集上的评估显示，其结果与最近的基线相当甚至更好，同时保持简单和计算效率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在低资源场景中可以应用，并且在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

*Linyue Ma,Yilong Xu,Xiang Long,Zhi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new paradigm called 'nugget-as-rubric' for reward modeling in search-augmented LLMs, along with an efficient generative verifier named Search-Gen-V that demonstrates strong performance across various workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations, including fragility to variations in expression and high computational costs for long-form workloads.

Method: We propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, 'nugget-as-rubric', which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. We design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting and introduce Search-Gen-V, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier trained via distillation and a two-stage strategy.

Result: Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Conclusion: Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

*Xinyue Ma,Pol Pastells,Mireia Farrús,Mariona Taulé*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法，通过创建一个英语-汉语句子对的数据集来教机器翻译模型关于汉语BEI被动语态的语义语气。实验结果显示，微调后的模型在翻译不利内容时表现更好，并且可以将这种知识转移到其他语言对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于词义可能有不同语义语气，因此应更加关注这一语言属性以生成准确的翻译。然而，当前的机器翻译模型无法处理这个问题。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了一种方法来教机器翻译模型关于特定结构的语义语气。

Method: 我们专注于汉语的BEI被动语态，创建了一个英语-汉语句子对的数据集，目的是展示BEI被动语态的负面语义语气。然后我们用这个数据集对OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行微调，以进行英语-汉语翻译任务。

Result: 微调后的MT模型在使用BEI被动语态翻译不利内容时表现更好，并且在中性或有利内容中避免使用它。此外，在NLLB-600M（一个多语言模型）中，这种语义语气的知识可以从英语-中文翻译转移到其他语言对，如西班牙语-中文。

Conclusion: 我们的实验结果表明，微调后的机器翻译模型在使用BEI被动语态翻译不利内容时表现更好，并且在中性或有利内容中避免使用它。此外，这种关于语义语气的知识可以从英语-中文翻译转移到其他语言对，如西班牙语-中文。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

*Xingmeng Zhao,Dan Schumacher,Veronica Rammouz,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种以人为中心的框架，通过生成用户故事和支持多代理讨论来帮助人们在部署前思考人工智能的潜在好处和危害。研究结果显示，故事讲述有助于参与者更全面地考虑人工智能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在迅速改变医疗保健，但快速且低门槛的开发可能会引入偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问的风险，特别是当系统忽视现实世界的情境和多样化用户需求时。许多最近的方法使用人工智能自动检测风险，但这会减少人类在理解危害如何产生以及影响谁方面的参与度。

Method: 我们提出了一种以人为中心的框架，该框架生成用户故事并支持多代理讨论，以帮助人们在部署前创造性地思考潜在的好处和危害。

Result: 在用户研究中，阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害，他们的回答在所有13种危害类型中分布更均匀。相比之下，没有阅读故事的参与者主要关注隐私和福祉（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，故事讲述有助于参与者推测更广泛的影响和好处，并更有创意地思考人工智能对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AutoRubric-R1V的框架，通过结合基于评分标准的奖励和结果奖励，提高了多模态大语言模型在复杂多步骤推理任务中的性能和推理的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法由于仅奖励最终答案的正确性，往往导致虚假推理。因此，需要一种能够提供过程级监督的方法来改善这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种框架AutoRubric-R1V，该框架将RLVR与过程级监督相结合，通过自动收集的基于评分标准的生成奖励来实现。关键创新在于一种可扩展的自我聚合方法，可以从成功的轨迹中提炼出一致的推理检查点，从而在没有人工注释或更强教师模型的情况下构建特定于问题的评分标准。

Result: AutoRubric-R1V在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并在专门的评估中显著提高了推理的可信度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过结合基于评分标准的奖励和结果奖励，在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并显著提高了推理的可信度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Pluto，一个用于评估LLM生成的Verilog设计效率的基准和评估框架。实验结果显示，尽管LLM在功能正确性上表现良好，但在合成效率方面仍有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试在评估硬件设计的合成指标（如面积、延迟和功耗）方面存在不足，缺乏优化的基线或验证测试平台。

Method: 本文提出了Pluto，这是一个基准和评估框架，旨在评估LLM生成的Verilog设计的效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLM可以在功能正确性上达到78.3%（pass@1），但在合成效率方面仍落后于专家编写的实现，面积效率为63.8%，延迟效率为65.9%，功耗效率为64.0%（eff@1）。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了需要效率意识的评估框架，如Pluto，以推动面向硬件的LLM研究的进步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

TL;DR: 我们提出了COIG-Writer数据集，用于研究中文创造性写作。我们的研究发现，创造性写作由叙事逻辑和语言表达组成，并揭示了过程监督、文化相关性和词汇多样性对创造性质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在创造性写作方面存在系统性缺陷，特别是在训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督的非英语语境中。我们提出了COIG-Writer，这是一个新的中文创造性写作数据集，通过系统地逆向工程高质量文本来捕捉多样化的输出及其底层思维过程。

Method: 我们通过系统地逆向工程高质量文本，创建了COIG-Writer数据集，该数据集包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖了51种类型，每个三元组包含：(1) 逆向工程的提示，(2) 记录决策过程的详细创意推理，以及(3) 最终文本。

Result: 我们的研究发现，创造性写作由两个组成部分构成：叙事逻辑（由过程监督提供）和语言表达（由通用数据保持）。我们的发现揭示了三个关键见解：(1) 过程监督非常有效，但需要与通用数据结合以稳定性能；(2) 创造力是文化相关的，没有跨语言迁移；(3) 词汇多样性与创造性质量成反比。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，创意卓越来自于逻辑结构和语言基础之间的相互作用，类似于数学推理如何增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Motivation: 评估需要推理的模型时，答案提取方法起着关键作用。我们的研究揭示了推理模型及其最终答案分布对所采用的答案提取算法高度敏感。

Method: 我们提出了一个基本框架：答案再生。该方法使用额外的模型推理，将输入和输出前缀为提示“Answer:”。然后从重新生成的输出中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 这种与提取规则无关的方法表现出更好的性能和增强的鲁棒性。此外，我们将这个框架应用于一般的数学问题和开放性问答任务。

Conclusion: 我们的分析和这个框架可以为模型评估提供更可靠的结果。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares contrastive learning and supervised fine-tuning for LLM-based reranking and finds that supervised fine-tuning provides a consistent advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the central question of which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking and what mechanism underlies the difference.

Method: We conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between contrastive learning (CL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We decompose the objectives into two components: weight and direction, and present a unified framework for understanding their interactions.

Result: SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, while the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. SFT has a consistent advantage over CL for LLM reranking. We also present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark.

Conclusion: SFT provides a consistent advantage over CL for LLM reranking, and our findings can benefit future research and applications in this area.

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Motivation: 现有的测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型并需要外部数据，这限制了它们在MoE架构中的实际应用。我们发现，可以仅基于输入上下文在线优化MoE专家选择。

Method: 我们提出了一种数据无关的在线测试时框架，通过基于已生成序列的自监督优化模型的路由决策，无需外部监督或数据即可持续适应MoE路由决策。

Result: 实验结果表明，在具有挑战性的推理任务中，我们的方法实现了性能提升，例如在HumanEval上提高了5.5%。此外，当与自一致性结合使用时，在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升了6%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在具有挑战性的推理任务中表现出一致的性能提升，同时保持对上下文变化的鲁棒性。此外，由于其即插即用的特性，该方法可以自然地补充现有的测试时扩展技术。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

Motivation: 尽管中段训练在实践中很受欢迎，但对其科学理解不足，因此需要系统地研究其效果和原因。

Method: 通过控制实验对语言模型进行从头预训练，并在不同领域的监督微调数据集上进行微调，以系统地研究中段训练。

Result: 中段训练在数学和代码领域最有效，能够最好地减少预训练和后训练数据之间的句法差距。在这些情况下，中段训练在领域内验证损失以及后训练后的预训练数据遗忘方面均优于持续预训练。

Conclusion: 中段训练作为一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练能通过减少遗忘获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR is a novel compiler stack that bridges the gap between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures, providing structured representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations. It enables efficient utilization of NPU compute fabric and memory hierarchy through compiler-managed scheduling, achieving high performance in applications like matrix multiplication and multi-head attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures. As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance, compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating compute and data to fully exploit such architectures.

Method: MLIR-AIR is a novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as AMD's NPUs. It defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and memory resources.

Result: For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, the AIR interface supports fused implementations using approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware.

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR transforms high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through compiler-managed scheduling.

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法来提高RAG系统的输出一致性，通过合成数据生成、三元组损失和分层模型合并，实验结果显示该方法有效提升了响应的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成准确且可靠的回答，这些回答基于检索到的上下文。然而，LLMs对于语义等价输入往往生成不一致的输出，这个问题由于专注于一致性训练数据的稀缺性和当前微调技术在提高输出一致性方面的局限性而变得更加严重。

Method: 我们提出了一种新方法，结合系统合成数据生成、三元组损失以获得更好的嵌入以及一种新颖的分层模型合并方法。使用从中间层激活中得出的一致性感知权重，我们的方法有效地整合了来自专业模型的知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的合并模型显著提高了输出的一致性，在响应相似度方面比基线提升了约47.5%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著提高了输出的一致性，实现了比基线约47.5%的响应相似度提升，从而为提高工业RAG系统的可靠性提供了一个实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的缩放定律无法捕捉下游任务性能，其中上下文起着关键作用。

Method: 我们提出了一个简单的、可解释的框架，联合建模下游性能作为训练计算和提供上下文的函数。

Result: 我们的框架准确地模拟了分布内的下游性能，在训练计算上跨三个数量级进行泛化，并可靠地外推随着上下文增加的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果为训练计算和上下文利用之间的相互作用提供了有价值的见解，为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于机器学习的模型在心理健康筛查中的效果，结果显示这些模型在诊断准确性方面优于传统的自我报告筛查工具，特别是在PTSD方面的表现尤为突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康障碍是全球残疾的主要原因之一，但抑郁症、焦虑症和创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）经常被误诊或漏诊，这主要是由于主观评估、有限的临床资源以及污名和低意识。在初级护理环境中，研究表明，超过60%的病例中，提供者未能正确识别抑郁症或焦虑症，突显了需要可扩展、可访问且上下文感知的诊断工具以支持早期检测和干预。

Method: 本研究评估了机器学习模型在心理健康筛查中的效果，使用了一个包含553个真实世界半结构化访谈的独特数据集，并对多种模型类别进行了基准测试，包括GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA的零样本提示，以及使用LoRA微调的RoBERTa模型。

Result: 本研究的模型在诊断类别上的准确率超过80%，特别是在PTSD方面达到89%的准确率和98%的召回率。使用较短的上下文和聚焦的上下文片段可以提高召回率，表明聚焦的叙述线索可以增强检测敏感性。LoRA微调在效率和效果上都表现良好，较低秩配置（如秩8和16）在评估指标上保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了基于大语言模型（LLM）的诊断工具在心理健康筛查中的有效性，为低资源或高污名环境中提供了一种低成本、高效的早期诊断方法。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的实践需要LLM使用两个独立的提示模板依次生成解决方案和自我验证，这显著降低了效率。因此，我们需要一种更高效的方法来统一推理和验证能力。

Method: 我们提出了LaSeR（基于最后令牌自我奖励的强化学习），该算法通过将原始RLVR损失与MSE损失相结合，使最后令牌的自我奖励分数与基于验证器的推理奖励对齐，联合优化LLM的推理和自我奖励能力。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法不仅提高了模型的推理性能，还赋予了它显著的自我奖励能力，从而提升了推理时的扩展性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法不仅提高了模型的推理性能，还赋予了它显著的自我奖励能力，从而提升了推理时的扩展性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在一般文本上表现出色，但它们在需要深度和相互关联知识的专门科学领域的能力仍不清楚。代谢组学具有复杂的生化途径、异构标识符系统和碎片化数据库，因此需要系统地评估LLMs在该领域的表现。

Method: 引入了MetaBench，这是第一个用于代谢组学评估的基准测试，从权威公共资源中整理而成，评估了五个对代谢组学研究至关重要的能力：知识、理解、定位、推理和研究。

Result: 对25个开源和闭源LLMs的评估显示，在代谢组学任务中存在不同的性能模式：尽管模型在文本生成任务中表现良好，但跨数据库标识符定位仍然具有挑战性，即使使用了检索增强技术。模型性能在长尾代谢物上下降，这些代谢物的注释稀疏。

Conclusion: MetaBench为开发和评估代谢组学AI系统提供了必要的基础设施，有助于推动可靠计算工具在代谢组学研究中的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

<details>

Motivation: Existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer, leading to reward sparsity in multi-turn settings, which causes advantage collapse and lack of fine-grained credit assignment.

Method: IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer.

Result: Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Conclusion: IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Conclusion: UI-Simulator-Grow展示了有针对性的合成扩展范式在持续和高效提升数字代理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于子词分词器基于统计而非语法，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因空格或标识符命名等表面因素而被不同地分词，这影响了代码大语言模型的行为。

Method: 我们引入了TokDrift框架，该框架应用语义保留重写规则来创建仅在分词上不同的代码变体。

Result: 在九个代码大语言模型中，即使是微小的格式更改也会导致模型行为的显著变化。层分析显示问题起源于早期嵌入，其中子词分割未能捕捉语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 我们的发现表明，不匹配的分词是可靠代码理解和生成的隐藏障碍，强调了未来代码大语言模型需要语法感知的分词。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Elastic-Cache是一种自适应的缓存更新策略，用于扩散大语言模型，通过减少冗余计算来加速解码，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的方法在每个去噪步骤和层中重新计算所有标记的QKV，尽管KV状态在大多数步骤中变化不大，尤其是在浅层中，导致了大量冗余。

Method: Elastic-Cache是一种无需训练、与架构无关的策略，通过关注感知的漂移测试来决定何时刷新（基于最常被注意的标记），并通过深度感知的计划来决定刷新的位置（从选定层开始重新计算，同时重用浅层缓存和超出窗口的MASK缓存）。

Result: Elastic-Cache在数学推理和代码生成任务上实现了显著的速度提升，如GSM8K（256 tokens）提升了8.7倍，长序列提升了45.1倍，HumanEval提升了4.8倍，同时保持了比基线更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，Elastic-Cache在保持生成质量的同时显著提高了吞吐量，并且在多个任务中实现了显著的速度提升，使得扩散大语言模型的实际部署成为可能。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Result: 模型在正确排序主要诊断代码方面的准确率为47%，分类指标的微F1和宏F1得分分别为0.6065和0.2904。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架在识别高优先级代码方面表现出色，优于其他方法。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

### [127] [Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14163)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了模型合并问题，提出了一种新的方法Reversible Model Merging (RMM)，该方法能够在不损失性能的情况下将多个低秩压缩模型合并为一个能够恢复原始任务特定模型的紧凑基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on model merging overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into low-rank representations, leading to severe performance degradation when conventional merging methods are applied.

Method: Reversible Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and task-specific coefficients for linear combination.

Result: RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.

Conclusion: RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融服务业中注释积压问题，其中数百万个客户语句需要准确分类。

Method: MAFA结合了专门的代理和结构化推理，以及基于裁判的共识机制。它支持动态任务适应，允许组织通过配置而不是代码更改来定义自定义注释类型。

Result: MAFA已消除了一百万个语音记录的积压，并平均与人工注释者达成86%的一致性，每年节省超过5000小时的手动注释工作。在内部意图分类数据集和其他公共基准测试中，MAFA显示出更高的Top-1、Top-5和F1分数。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了MAFA（多代理注释框架），这是一个在企业规模注释工作流中通过可配置的多代理协作进行转换的生产部署系统。MAFA解决了金融服务业中的注释积压问题，通过专门的代理和结构化推理以及基于裁判的共识机制，使组织能够通过配置而不是代码更改来定义自定义注释类型。在摩根大通部署后，MAFA已消除了一百万个语音记录的积压，并平均与人工注释者达成86%的一致性，每年节省超过5000小时的手动注释工作。该系统通过注释置信度分类处理语音记录，通常为85%高、10%中等、5%低。这使得人工注释者可以专注于模糊和低覆盖率的情况。MAFA在多个数据集和语言上表现出有效性，显示出优于传统和单代理注释基线的一致改进。本文填补了理论多代理系统和实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似注释挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Motivation: 尽管一些专有模型声称在IOI中达到了金牌水平，但往往方法不透明，而使用开放权重模型达到类似结果仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: GenCluster结合了大规模生成、行为聚类、排名和轮换提交策略，在有限的验证预算下高效探索多样化的解决方案空间。

Conclusion: GenCluster可以首次使用开放权重模型gpt-oss-120b在IOI 2025中获得金牌，为LLM推理的透明和可重复评估设定了新基准。

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 为了克服大型语言模型作为黑盒且内部机制不明确的局限性，研究人员提出了各种可解释性方法，但这些方法仍存在不足。因此，需要一种新的方法来提供更深入的理解。

Method: CAST（Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking）是一种无需探测器的框架，通过直接变换矩阵估计和全面的频谱分析来分析变压器层功能。

Result: CAST通过估计每层的实现变换矩阵并应用六个可解释的指标进行频谱分析，揭示了编码器-only和解码器-only模型之间的不同行为，以及层之间的功能关系模式。

Conclusion: CAST提供了一种新的视角来分析变压器层功能，通过直接变换矩阵估计和全面的频谱分析，为现有方法提供了补充见解。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统分析了基于大型语言模型的提示优化中的中毒风险，发现反馈攻击比注入查询更具威胁性，并提出了一种有效的防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM-based提示优化器在日常AI应用中起着关键作用，而优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究，因此需要进行系统分析以识别潜在的安全风险。

Method: 我们使用HarmBench进行了系统分析，以评估基于大型语言模型的提示优化中的中毒风险。此外，我们提出了一种轻量级的高亮防御方法来减少虚假奖励的影响。

Result: 我们发现系统在受到操纵的反馈攻击时比受到注入查询的攻击更容易受到威胁，反馈攻击可将攻击成功率（ASR）提高高达ΔASR = 0.48。此外，我们提出的轻量级高亮防御方法能显著降低虚假奖励的影响。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果确立了提示优化流程作为第一类攻击面，并促使对反馈通道和优化框架采取更强的保护措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AEPO, an agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases, which consistently outperforms existing methods on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper delves into the challenges caused by entropy and proposes AEPO to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases.

Method: AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues; and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens.

Result: Results across 14 challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5.

Conclusion: AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating scalable web agent training.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Motivation: 我们从不同的角度探讨这个问题，询问是否可以通过纯采样在推理时从基础模型中引出可比较的推理能力，而无需任何额外训练。

Method: 我们提出了一种简单的迭代采样算法，利用基础模型自身的似然性。

Result: 我们的算法在各种单次任务上提供了显著的推理提升，几乎与RL相当，甚至超过RL。此外，我们的采样器避免了RL后训练中的多样性崩溃。

Conclusion: 我们的方法不需要训练、精心制作的数据集或验证器，表明它在易于验证的领域之外有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Motivation: 最近的预训练努力表明，这些架构可以扩展到现代语言建模任务，并在推理任务中表现出优势。然而，现有的自回归生成方法在现代硬件上的时间预算下可能不够高效。因此，我们需要一种更高效的生成方法。

Method: 我们研究了循环深度模型和扩散语言模型之间的关系，并基于它们的相似性开发了一种新的扩散强制采样器来加速生成。该采样器在每次前向传递中解码新标记，同时这些标记的潜在状态可以通过循环并行细化。

Result: 我们的采样器理论上比使用相同时间预算的基线自回归生成更具表现力。此外，基于扩散文献的原则，该采样器可以直接应用于现有的3.5B循环深度变压器，无需任何调整，从而实现高达5倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: 我们的研究不仅提供了一种在推理时并行化循环深度模型额外计算的高效机制，还表明这些模型可以自然地被视为强大的连续但因果的扩散语言模型。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交媒体上，许多经历自杀意念（SI）的人不会明确披露他们的困扰。检测这些隐含的信号对于早期干预至关重要，但仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 我们采用了一种复合网络中心性度量来识别用户的顶级邻居，并在时间上对齐用户和邻居的交互，将多层信号整合到微调的DeBERTa-v3模型中。

Result: 在Reddit的1000名用户（500名病例和500名对照）研究中，我们的方法比仅基于个体的基线提高了15%的早期和隐含SI检测效果。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，同伴互动提供了有价值的预测信号，并对设计能够捕捉在线环境中间接和隐藏的风险表达的早期检测系统具有更广泛的意义。

Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not
disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly
through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals
early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a
forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that
models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal
posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We
adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a
user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions --
integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a
Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves
early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These
findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and
carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture
indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的共识声明生成框架缺乏内在结构，无法在聚合多样化的自由形式意见时提供可证明的公平性保证。因此，本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一种新的框架来实现更公平的共识生成。

Method: 本文将共识声明生成建模为一个多目标、令牌级马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），其中每个目标对应一个代理的偏好。通过使用社会选择理论，提出了两种方法：一种是基于先验核心稳定性的随机生成策略，另一种是在MDP框架内使用搜索算法最大化平等福利。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于平等目标的搜索方法生成的共识声明在最坏情况下的代理对齐度优于基线方法，包括Habermas Machine。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于多目标、令牌级马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）的共识声明生成框架，该框架能够提供可证明的公平性保证。通过社会选择理论的两种方法，分别实现了先验核心稳定性和最大化平等福利的目标，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline

TL;DR: 本文提出了Terrarium框架，用于研究基于LLM的多智能体系统中的安全、隐私和安全性问题，并展示了其灵活性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统在自动化用户任务方面具有潜力，但同时也引入了新的风险，包括对齐问题和恶意方的攻击。因此，需要一个框架来研究安全、隐私和安全性。

Method: 本文提出了Terrarium框架，该框架重新利用了黑板设计，以创建用于多智能体协作的模块化、可配置的测试平台。

Result: Terrarium框架能够识别关键的攻击向量，并通过实现三个协作MAS场景和四种代表性攻击来展示其灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium旨在通过提供快速原型设计、评估和迭代防御和设计的工具，加速向可信多智能体系统的发展。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: AI4Service introduces Alpha-Service, a framework that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life through AI glasses, demonstrating its capability to perceive environments, infer user intent, and provide timely help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move AI from being a passive tool to an active and adaptive companion that can anticipate user needs and take proactive actions when appropriate.

Method: Alpha-Service is a unified framework inspired by the von Neumann computer architecture and based on AI glasses. It consists of five key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human interaction.

Result: Case studies including a real-time Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant demonstrate Alpha-Service's ability to provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: Alpha-Service demonstrates the potential of AI as a proactive and adaptive companion in daily life, showing that it can seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user intent, and provide timely assistance without explicit prompts.

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

*Xikai Zhang,Bo Wang,Likang Xiao,Yongzhi Li,Quan Chen,Wenju Wu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IMAGINE的框架，将多智能体系统的推理和规划能力整合到一个紧凑模型中，并通过端到端训练显著提升了性能。在TravelPlanner数据集上，该方法表现出色，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统虽然能提供改进的集体推理，但往往因多轮内部交互、长响应延迟和难以端到端训练而面临高推理成本的问题。因此，需要一种更高效、更简洁的解决方案来提升复杂推理和规划的能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为IMAGINE的通用且可扩展的框架，将多智能体系统（MAS）的推理和规划能力整合到一个单一的紧凑模型中，并通过简单的端到端训练实现性能的显著提升。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型并应用IMAGINE方法，模型在TravelPlanner基准上的最终通过率达到了82.7%，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架能够将多智能体系统的推理和规划能力整合到一个紧凑的模型中，并通过简单的端到端训练显著超越多智能体系统的性能。实验结果表明，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型并应用该方法，模型在TravelPlanner基准上的最终通过率达到了82.7%，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

Result: 通过在各种基线上评估ColorBench，发现了现有模型的局限性，并提出了改进方向和技术路径，以提高代理在复杂、长期问题上的性能。

Conclusion: 本文通过评估ColorBench发现现有模型的局限性，并提出了改进方向和技术路径，以提高代理在复杂、长周期问题上的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a structured knowledge graph.

Method: TITAN integrates a path planner model, which predicts logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Conclusion: TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种形式理论，用于描述和衡量由领域先验引导的LLM辅助迭代搜索，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型的生成-过滤-精炼（迭代范式）在AI+Science的推理、编程和程序发现中取得了进展，但搜索的有效性取决于搜索的位置，即如何将领域先验编码到操作结构化的假设空间中。

Method: 本文将代理表示为输入和输出上的模糊关系算子，以捕捉可行的转换；通过单个延续参数加权所有可达路径，并求和得到覆盖生成函数；这导致了可达性难度的度量，并提供了由安全包络诱导的图上的搜索几何解释。

Result: 本文提出的理论提供了测量代理及其搜索空间的可行语言和操作工具，并提出了由LLM构建的迭代搜索的系统形式描述。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个紧凑的形式理论，用于描述和衡量由领域先验引导的LLM辅助迭代搜索。该理论提供了一种可行的语言和操作工具，以衡量代理及其搜索空间，并提出了由LLM构建的迭代搜索的系统形式描述。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于判别验证的高效测试时扩展机制，能够在固定计算预算下显著提升大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然最先进的方法通常使用生成验证器从候选池中选择最佳解决方案，但这种方法会带来高昂的计算成本，限制了其实用性。因此，我们转向一种更注重预算的范式：判别验证。

Method: 我们进行了详尽的实证分析，并展示了判别验证器在单独使用时可能表现不佳，但将其与自我一致性结合在混合方法中可以创建一个强大且高效的测试时扩展机制。

Result: 在固定的计算预算下，这种混合方法显著超越了最先进的生成验证方法：在AIME2025上实现了高达15.3%的更高准确率。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，在实际应用中，使用判别验证器的预算感知扩展不仅是一种‘免费’的升级，而且是比昂贵的生成技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文系统地研究了多模态抑郁症检测，发现结合EEG、语音和文本可以提高检测效果，预训练嵌入优于手工特征，并且三模态模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究在范围上有限，缺乏对特征的系统比较，并且评估协议不一致。我们旨在解决这些差距。

Method: 我们系统地探索了EEG、语音和文本中的特征表示和建模策略，评估了手工特征与预训练嵌入的效果，评估了不同神经编码器的有效性，比较了单模态、双模态和三模态配置，并分析了融合策略，重点关注EEG的作用。

Result: 结果表明，(i) EEG、语音和文本模态的结合增强了多模态检测，(ii) 预训练嵌入优于手工特征，(iii) 经过精心设计的三模态模型达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的工作为多模态抑郁症检测的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

TL;DR: 本文将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，并通过构建H-Risk指数验证了其有效性，结果表明该方法可以用于诊断和减少推理系统中的过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探索康德哲学与现代反馈控制理论之间的潜在联系，并尝试利用这种联系来诊断和减少推理系统中的过度自信问题。

Method: 本文通过构建一个综合不稳定性指数（H-Risk），结合频谱裕度、条件性、时间敏感性和创新放大性，重新解释了康德的《纯粹理性批判》作为反馈稳定性理论。此外，还进行了线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型的实验验证。

Result: 研究发现，较高的H-Risk预测了即使在正式稳定的情况下也会出现过度自信的错误，揭示了名义稳定性和认识稳定性之间的差距。在大型语言模型中，脆弱的内部动态与校准不当和幻觉相关，而批判风格的提示对校准和幻觉的影响则混合。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论的方法，通过构建一个综合不稳定性指数（H-Risk）来形式化这一直觉，并在大型语言模型中验证了其有效性。结果表明，这种结构可以作为康德式自我限制与反馈控制之间的桥梁，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过度自信提供了一个原则性的视角。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Conclusion: 当前开源模型在机器设计任务中仍有不足，需要探索强化学习等方法进行改进。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Motivation: 大多数以前的研究都使用了五大性格特征来进行多模态明显性格特征识别。然而，没有研究专注于明显HEXACO，它可以评估与转移攻击和报复性有关的诚实-谦逊特质和社会支配倾向等。此外，通过机器学习建模时，五大性格特征和HEXACO之间的关系尚未明确。我们期望通过考虑这些关系来提高对多模态人类行为的认识。

Method: 本文提出的重点是优化同时识别五大性格特征和HEXACO。

Result: 实验使用自我介绍视频数据集表明，所提出的方法可以有效地识别五大性格特征和HEXACO。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个联合建模方法，将五大性格特征和HEXACO结合起来，以自动识别多模态人类行为中的明显性格特征。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型主要局限于对象级或区域级的定位，缺乏通过自然语言进行像素级关键点理解的能力。因此，本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一种新的框架来实现像素级的定位。

Method: 本文提出了一个包含两个互补组件的框架：Point Descriptor 和 Point Localizer。Point Descriptor 生成丰富的、上下文相关的单个关键点描述，而 Point Localizer 则从这些描述中回归精确的像素坐标。此外，为了跨类别泛化，我们在 AP-10K 上对 Point Descriptor 进行优化，并使用冻结的 Point Localizer 作为奖励模型以产生最大化定位准确性的描述。

Result: 实验表明，在 LlamaPointInPart 数据集上，本文的方法优于基线模型。此外，本文还引入了一个名为 LlamaPointInPart 的数据集，包含 20K+ 张图像-关键点-描述三元组，用于训练和评估该框架。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的框架，用于像素级的定位。该框架具有双向特性，应能促进未来在关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位方面的应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLM在多种视觉-语言任务中表现出色，但它们在人脸识别领域的潜力尚未得到充分探索。需要评估和比较开源MLLM与现有面部识别模型在标准基准上的表现。

Method: 我们对最先进的MLLM进行了系统性基准测试，以评估其在人脸识别任务中的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然MLLM能够捕捉到对人脸相关任务有用丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用中的高精度识别场景下，它们仍落后于专业模型。

Conclusion: 本基准测试为推进基于MLLM的人脸识别提供了基础，并为设计更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

Result: 实验结果表明，在分类和检索方面，本文的方法在七个细粒度视觉数据集上都优于现有方法，并且这种性能在用户以自然语言实现任务的各种方式中保持稳定。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为nlg2choice的简单两阶段方法，在检索设置中通过早期停止方法显著提高了吞吐量，并在七个细粒度视觉数据集上取得了改进的分类和检索性能。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MathCanvas，一个全面的框架，旨在赋予统一的大规模多模态模型（LMMs）内在的视觉链式思维（VCoT）能力。通过两个阶段的训练，模型在数学问题解决方面表现出色，并在基准测试中取得了显著的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉链式思维（VCoT）方法通常受到刚性外部工具的限制，或无法生成高保真度、战略性时间安排的图表，这对于复杂问题解决是必要的。为了弥合这一差距，我们引入了MathCanvas。

Method: 我们引入了MathCanvas，这是一个全面的框架，旨在赋予统一的大规模多模态模型（LMMs）内在的视觉链式思维（VCoT）能力。我们的方法包括两个阶段：第一阶段是视觉操作阶段，对模型进行预训练；第二阶段是战略视觉辅助推理阶段，对模型进行微调。

Result: 我们的模型BAGEL-Canvas在MathCanvas-Bench上相对于强大的LMM基线取得了86%的相对改进，展示了其在其他公共数学基准上的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们的工作提供了一个完整的工具包-框架、数据集和基准，以在LMM中解锁复杂的类人视觉辅助推理。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将生成式人工智能整合到专业遗产实践中的潜力，以提高面向公众的指导文件的可访问性。研究开发了一个名为HAZEL的GenAI聊天机器人，并将其与ChatGPT进行比较，结果显示HAZEL表现略优，但仍有局限性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索将生成式人工智能（GenAI）整合到专业遗产实践中的潜力，以提高面向公众的指导文件的可访问性。

Method: 开发了一个名为HAZEL的GenAI聊天机器人，该机器人经过微调以协助修订与遗产保护和解释相关的书面指导。通过定量评估，将HAZEL的表现与ChatGPT（GPT-4）进行比较，以评估其在指导写作过程相关任务中的表现。

Result: HAZEL在指导写作任务中的表现略优于ChatGPT，这表明在底层大型语言模型（LLM）经过微调后，GenAI聊天机器人更为有效。然而，也注意到在需要文化敏感性和更高级技术专业知识的领域存在显著限制。

Conclusion: 尽管GenAI不能取代人类遗产专业人员在技术写作任务中的作用，但其在自动化和加快某些指导写作方面的潜力可能为资源有限的遗产组织带来有价值的益处。

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of
enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed
HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance
relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative
assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a
series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this
comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in
resource-constrained contexts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过推断用户当前目标并优化以实现该目标的方法，从而提高大型语言模型的响应性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当大型语言模型没有特定目标时，它们会产生平淡无奇的结果，例如充满陈词滥调的电子邮件草稿。因此，需要一种方法来推断用户的即时目标，并优化以实现该目标。

Method: 本文提出了一种架构，通过被动观察用户行为来自动诱导即时目标，然后通过生成和评估来引导下游AI系统。

Result: 在实验中，JIT目标使LLM输出在66-86%的胜率上超过了典型的LLM，并且现场使用会话确认JIT目标产生了每个参与者独特的专业工具。

Conclusion: 本文表明，通过推断用户当前的目标并迅速优化以实现该目标，大型语言模型可以生成更响应和期望的工具、界面和响应。

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.
