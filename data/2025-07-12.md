### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过实验方法分析了大型语言模型的认知偏差来源，发现预训练是主要因素，这为未来减少这些偏差提供了重要见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的研究发现大型语言模型的认知偏差会因模型而异，并且可能在指令微调过程中被放大，但这些差异是否源于预训练、微调或训练随机性仍不清楚。

Method: 我们采用了一种两步的因果实验方法，首先通过使用不同的随机种子对模型进行微调，以研究训练随机性如何影响超过30种认知偏差。其次，我们引入了跨微调——在模型之间交换指令数据集，以隔离偏差来源。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，虽然训练随机性引入了一些变化，但偏差主要由预训练决定：具有相同预训练主干的模型表现出比仅共享微调数据的模型更相似的偏差模式。

Conclusion: 我们的研究揭示了预训练在塑造大型语言模型的认知偏差中的主要作用，这为未来评估和减轻这些偏差提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在规范调查情境中的响应鲁棒性，发现它们存在近期偏差，并且对语义变化和组合扰动敏感，强调了提示设计和鲁棒性测试的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在研究大型语言模型在规范调查情境中的响应鲁棒性，了解它们的可靠性和对已知响应偏差的易感性。

Method: 本文测试了九种不同的大型语言模型在世界价值观调查（WVS）问题上的响应鲁棒性，并应用了11种全面的扰动来改变问题措辞和答案选项结构，导致超过167,000次模拟访谈。

Result: 所有测试的模型都表现出一致的近期偏差，倾向于选择最后呈现的答案选项。虽然较大的模型通常更稳健，但所有模型仍然对语义变化如改写和组合扰动敏感。

Conclusion: 本文强调了在使用大型语言模型生成合成调查数据时，提示设计和鲁棒性测试的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

### [3] [SynthTextEval: Synthetic Text Data Generation and Evaluation for High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07229)
*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval是一个用于评估合成文本的工具包，能够从多个维度评估合成数据的效用、公平性、隐私风险等，并在医疗和法律领域展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型输出的流畅性使得合成文本在许多应用中具有潜力，例如减少在高风险领域中AI系统开发和部署的隐私泄露风险，因此需要对合成数据进行系统且一致的评估。

Method: SynthTextEval是一个工具包，允许用户对上传或使用工具包生成的合成数据进行多维评估，包括下游系统的效用、公平性、隐私泄露风险、分布差异和领域专家的定性反馈。

Result: SynthTextEval可以用于评估合成数据的多个维度，并在医疗和法律两个高风险领域中展示了其功能和效果。通过整合和标准化评估指标，旨在提高合成文本的可行性。

Conclusion: SynthTextEval旨在通过综合评估合成文本的多个维度，提高其在高风险领域中的可行性，并促进AI开发中的隐私保护。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对医疗领域的安全评估协议，涵盖患者、临床医生和一般用户视角，并构建了PatientSafetyBench数据集，以评估医疗LLM的安全性。这是首次通过针对性红队测试为医疗LLM定义安全评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用扩大，其安全性问题变得尤为重要。现有的安全评估主要集中在通用基准上，而缺乏针对医疗领域的特定评估方法。因此，本文旨在填补这一空白，提供一种专门针对医疗领域的安全评估协议。

Method: 本文引入了一个针对医疗领域的安全评估协议，包括患者和临床医生视角的评估，以及通用安全评估。同时，构建了包含466个样本的PatientSafetyBench数据集，用于从患者角度衡量安全性。此外，还对MediPhi模型集合进行了红队测试作为案例研究。

Result: 本文构建了PatientSafetyBench数据集，用于测量医疗LLM的安全性。通过红队测试，对MediPhi模型集合进行了安全分析，并验证了所提出的评估协议的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个针对医疗领域的安全评估协议，通过患者、临床医生和一般用户的不同视角进行评估，并建立了PatientSafetyBench数据集。这是首次通过针对性的红队测试为医疗LLM定义安全评估标准，为医疗领域更安全的部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究分析了单对话和多组对话环境中的中断检测，并提出了一种对重叠语音具有鲁棒性的中断识别方法，为未来工作奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在小班合作学习中需要处理多个同时进行的对话，因此需要一种能够处理重叠语音的中断检测方法。

Method: 我们分析了单对话和多组对话设置中的中断检测，并创建了一种对重叠语音具有鲁棒性的中断识别方法。

Result: 我们创建了一种对重叠语音具有鲁棒性的中断识别方法，并揭示了中断在协作小组互动中的语言和语调信息。

Conclusion: 我们的研究为未来工作提供了基础，以考虑多组重叠语音对跟踪小组对话的影响。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多智能体检索增强框架，用于生成针对健康虚假信息的反谣言内容，该方法在多个方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究依赖有限的证据，并且对最终输出的控制较少。

Method: 我们提出了一种多智能体检索增强框架，结合多个LLM来优化知识检索、证据增强和响应优化。

Result: 我们的方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性方面优于基线方法，证明了其在生成高质量反谣言内容方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

### [7] [GNN-CNN: An Efficient Hybrid Model of Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07414)
*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合GNNs和CNNs的新模型架构，用于提高深度学习在长文本处理中的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长文本时计算复杂度高，效率低，因此需要一种更高效的模型架构。

Method: 该研究引入了一种结合图神经网络（GNNs）和卷积神经网络（CNNs）的新模型架构，并集成了实时端到端的图生成机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在多个文本分类任务中表现良好，具有较高的效率和竞争力。

Conclusion: 该模型在多个文本分类任务中表现出高效的性能和竞争力。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl是一种可读性控制的指令微调框架，能够调整输出复杂度而不影响意义，已在多个医疗和通用领域任务中表现出色，比GPT-4更受专家青睐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在医疗保健中显示出强大的潜力，但有效的人机通信是一个关键挑战，内容必须既个性化又易于理解。

Method: MedReadCtrl是一种可读性控制的指令微调框架，使LLM能够在不损害意义的情况下调整输出复杂度。

Result: 评估显示，MedReadCtrl在九个数据集和三个任务中的表现显著优于GPT-4，并在未见过的临床任务中取得了显著提升。专家们普遍更喜欢MedReadCtrl。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能够通过重构临床内容为可访问的、与可读性一致的语言，同时保持医学意图，提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，以支持患者教育并扩大AI驱动护理的公平获取。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

*Zonghai Yao,Youxia Zhao,Avijit Mitra,David A. Levy,Emily Druhl,Jack Tsai,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的方法，利用大语言模型和自动化技术从临床笔记中提取驱逐状态，并创建了一个大规模的公开数据集，取得了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是重要的社会决定因素，但其在结构化电子健康记录（EHRs）中很少被编码，限制了后续应用。因此，需要一种有效的方法来提取驱逐状态。

Method: 该研究结合了大语言模型（LLMs）、人机协作标注和自动化提示优化（APO）来提取驱逐状态，并创建了一个包含14个细粒度类别的数据集。

Result: 使用SynthEHR-Eviction管道训练的细调LLMs（如Qwen2.5、LLaMA3）在人类验证数据上达到了88.8%（驱逐）和90.3%（其他SDoH）的宏F1分数，优于GPT-4o-APO、GPT-4o-mini-APO和BioBERT。

Conclusion: 该研究引入了SynthEHR-Eviction管道，用于从临床笔记中提取驱逐状态，并创建了最大的公开驱逐相关社会决定因素（SDoH）数据集。该方法在多个模型上实现了高精度，并且具有成本效益和可扩展性。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了将时间序列推理能力蒸馏到小的指令调优语言模型中，以构建可解释的时间序列基础模型。通过使用合成数据集和自然语言注释对模型进行微调，结果显示模型获得了有意义的解释能力，这为开发小型、可解释的模型奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 我们研究了将时间序列推理能力蒸馏到小的指令调优语言模型中，作为构建可解释的时间序列基础模型的一步。

Method: 我们利用一个具有系统变化趋势和噪声水平的均值回归时间序列的合成数据集，使用大型多模态模型生成自然语言注释，并用这些注释来监督紧凑Qwen模型的微调。

Result: 我们引入了评估指标，用于评估蒸馏推理的质量——重点关注趋势方向、噪声强度和极值定位——并展示了后训练模型获得了有意义的解释能力。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，将时间序列理解压缩到轻量级、语言能力模型中是可行的，这些模型适合设备端或隐私敏感的部署。这项工作为开发小型、可解释的模型奠定了基础，这些模型可以以自然语言解释时间模式。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

### [11] [SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441)
*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)的框架，使LLM代理在做出决定之前能够明确地对候选动作进行权衡。通过引入自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作批判，SAND在两个代表性的交互代理任务中实现了平均20%的改进，并且优于最先进的代理调优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要关注模仿特定专家行为或促进选定的推理思路和行动，但缺乏对替代行动的推理和比较，可能导致LLM代理过度承诺看似合理但次优的行动。

Method: 提出了一种名为Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)的框架，使LLM代理在做出决定之前能够明确地对候选动作进行权衡。引入了自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作批判，以帮助合成步骤式的动作权衡思考。

Result: SAND框架在两个代表性的交互代理任务中实现了平均20%的改进，并且优于最先进的代理调优方法。

Conclusion: SAND框架在两个代表性的交互代理任务中实现了平均20%的改进，并且优于最先进的代理调优方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Jia Fu,Jingyuan Zhang,Kai Fu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLEP是一种两阶段框架，通过重放高质量示例来改进强化学习，提高模型的收敛速度和最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习（RL）对于大型语言模型来说是一个能耗密集的任务：训练可能不稳定，策略可能会逐渐偏离其预训练权重。

Method: RLEP是一个两阶段框架，首先收集验证过的轨迹，然后在后续训练中重放它们。在每个更新步骤中，策略在混合新生成的rollouts和这些重放的成功示例的mini-batches上进行优化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B基础模型上，RLEP以更少的更新次数达到基线峰值准确率，并最终超越它，提高了AIME-2024、AIME-2025和AMC-2023的准确率。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量示例，使模型远离无果的探索，专注于有希望的推理路径，实现了更快的收敛和更强的最终性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at

*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出机器谎言作为描述LLM中真理丧失现象的总体概念框架，并引入Bullshit Index指标和四种谎言形式的分类法。研究发现RLHF微调和CoT提示会加剧谎言，尤其在政治情境中，模糊用语是主要策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的研究已经探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）的幻觉和迎合现象，但我们提出机器谎言作为一个总体的概念框架，使研究人员能够描述LLM中出现的真理丧失的广泛现象，并揭示其潜在机制。

Method: 我们引入了Bullshit Index，这是一种量化LLMs对真理冷漠的新指标，并提出了一个互补的分类法，分析四种定性的谎言形式：空洞的修辞、欺骗性陈述、模糊用语和未经证实的声明。

Result: 我们的结果表明，使用人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）进行模型微调会显著加剧谎言，并且推理时的思维链（CoT）提示明显放大了特定类型的谎言，尤其是空洞的修辞和欺骗性陈述。我们还观察到在政治情境中普遍存在机器谎言，其中模糊用语是主要策略。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果突显了AI对齐中的系统性挑战，并为更真实的LLM行为提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

*Mihir Parmar,Palash Goyal,Xin Liu,Yiwen Song,Mingyang Ling,Chitta Baral,Hamid Palangi,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 PLAN-TUNING，这是一种统一的后训练框架，通过从大规模 LLM 中提炼任务分解并微调较小的模型，以提高其复杂推理能力。实验结果显示，该方法在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管将复杂问题分解为简单子任务在人类自然规划中至关重要，并且显著提升了大型语言模型（LLMs）的性能，但利用这种规划结构在后训练中提升较小的开源 LLM 的性能仍研究不足。

Method: PLAN-TUNING 是一个统一的后训练框架，它 (i) 从大规模 LLM 中提炼合成任务分解（称为“规划轨迹”），并 (ii) 通过监督和强化学习目标微调较小的模型，以模仿这些规划过程来提高复杂推理能力。

Result: 在 GSM8k 和 MATH 基准测试中，计划调整的模型平均比强基线高出约 7%。此外，在域外数据集上，计划调整的模型显示出更好的泛化能力，分别在 OlympiadBench 和 AIME 2024 上平均提高了约 10% 和 12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING 是一种有效的策略，可以提高小型 LLM 的任务特定性能。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

TL;DR: TeaR通过数据整理和强化学习提升LLM的推理能力，在多个模型和基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强推理能力是LLM研究的核心，但直接应用代码执行可能导致过度依赖复杂数据结构和算法，从而导致过拟合。

Method: TeaR通过精心的数据整理和强化学习，引导模型在与代码相关的任务中发现最优的推理路径。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，TeaR表现出显著的性能提升，例如在Qwen2.5-7B上提升了35.9%，在R1-Distilled-7B上提升了5.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR能够显著提升LLM的推理能力，适用于多种模型和基准测试。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种使用 DyGIE++ 和 BERT 变体的方法来提取 ORR 催化剂信息，并构建了 FC-CoMIcs 数据集。结果表明，领域特定的 BERT 模型在 ORR 催化剂提取方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大量科学文献中提取关于 ORR 催化剂的结构化信息仍然是一个重大挑战，因为文本数据复杂且多样。

Method: 使用 DyGIE++ 和多个预训练 BERT 变体（包括 MatSciBERT 和 PubMedBERT）进行命名实体识别（NER）和关系抽取（RE），以从科学文献中提取 ORR 催化剂相关信息，并构建了一个用于材料信息学的燃料电池语料库（FC-CoMIcs）。

Result: 微调的 PubMedBERT 模型在 NER 上达到了 82.19% 的 F1 分数，而 MatSciBERT 在 RE 上达到了 66.10% 的 F1 分数。与人工标注者相比，微调模型在 ORR 催化剂提取方面表现出可靠性。

Conclusion: 领域特定的 BERT 模型在 ORR 催化剂提取方面优于通用科学模型，如 BlueBERT。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Result: 本文展示了LLM在处理超出一定复杂度的计算和代理任务时的不足，并指出它们无法验证超出一定复杂度任务的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文结论是，LLM在处理超出一定复杂度的计算和代理任务时存在局限性，并且无法验证超出一定复杂度任务的准确性。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，利用有限的真实数据和专家知识来微调两个大型语言模型，以创建和优化心理支持对话，并构建了一个数据集和一个支持系统，实验结果显示该系统在相关任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于日益增长的压力，对心理支持的需求不断增加，但相关数据集，特别是在非英语语言中，却十分稀缺。

Method: 我们提出了一个框架，利用有限的真实世界数据和专家知识来微调两个大型语言模型：对话生成器和对话修改器。生成器基于预定义路径创建大规模的心理咨询对话，修改器则使这些对话与真实世界的数据质量一致。

Result: 我们构建了中文心理支持对话数据集（CPsDD），包含68K对话，涵盖13个组、16种心理问题、13种原因和12种支持重点。此外，我们引入了综合代理对话支持系统（CADSS）。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上都达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Motivation: 传统的研究主要集中在双人对话设置中，而本研究旨在将VAP扩展到三元对话场景中，以预测即将到来的轮流说话。

Method: 本研究使用日本三元数据集训练多个模型，以研究语音活动投影（VAP）在三元多主体场景中的应用。

Result: 研究发现，基于三元对话训练的VAP在所有模型中都优于基线，但对话类型影响了准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了VAP可以用于三元对话场景中的轮流说话。未来的工作将把这种三元VAP轮流说话模型整合到语音对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探索大型语言模型在多语言主观性检测任务中的应用，特别是在标记数据稀缺或不一致的情况下，提供一种有效的替代传统微调的方法。

Method: 本文提出了一种使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行多语言主观性检测的竞争性方法，通过少量提示的方式。我们参与了CheckThat! 2025评估活动的任务1：主观性。我们展示了当与精心设计的提示配对时，LLMs可以匹配或超越微调的小型语言模型（SLMs），尤其是在嘈杂或低质量的数据设置中。

Result: 我们的系统在CheckThat! 2025的主观性检测任务中多个语言中取得了顶级排名，包括阿拉伯语和波兰语的第一名，以及意大利语、英语、德语和多语言轨道的前四名。值得注意的是，我们的方法在阿拉伯语数据集上表现尤为稳健，这可能是因为其对注释不一致的抵抗力。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了基于大型语言模型的少样本学习在多语言情感任务中的有效性和适应性，提供了一种传统微调的有力替代方案，特别是在标记数据稀缺或不一致的情况下。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作主要集中在生成上，并依赖于来自开放领域来源的基准，如维基百科。然而，在这些设置中，检索挑战往往被隐藏起来。为了弥补这一差距，我们研究了在特定领域设置下的阿拉伯语-英语RAG。

Method: 我们研究了阿拉伯语-英语的跨语言RAG，并使用来自现实世界企业数据集的基准进行分析。我们的基准包括用户查询和支撑文档的所有语言组合，独立且均匀随机选取。

Result: 我们的发现表明，在跨语言特定领域场景中，检索是一个关键瓶颈，当用户查询和支撑文档的语言不同时，性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果突出了在实际的跨语言RAG应用中改进多语言检索的重要机会。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了长链式思维监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的作用和相互作用，发现它们在不同难度水平上的表现各有优劣，且结合策略未能带来显著增益，提出了需要更无缝和自适应方法的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）越来越多地采用后训练技术如长链式思维监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）以激发复杂的推理能力，研究这些方法在VLMs中的联合效果变得尤为重要。然而，目前尚不清楚这些方法在VLMs中的协同作用如何。

Method: 本文对长链式思维监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）在多个多模态推理基准中的作用和相互作用进行了系统研究。通过实验分析了SFT和RL在不同难度水平上的表现，并探索了多种结合策略的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，SFT在困难问题上通过深入、结构化的推理提高了性能，但增加了冗长性并降低了简单问题的表现；而RL促进了泛化和简洁性，在所有难度级别上都带来了稳定的改进，但在最难的问题上改进不如SFT明显。此外，尝试将两种方法结合的各种策略并未产生明显的增益，反而导致了权衡。

Conclusion: 本文指出，尽管长链式思维监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）在语言模型中表现出协同作用，但在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中它们的联合效果并不明确。通过实验发现，SFT能提高复杂问题的表现，但会增加冗长性并降低简单问题的表现；而RL则促进泛化和简洁性，但在最难的问题上提升不明显。此外，尝试结合这两种方法的各种策略并未带来显著的增益，反而导致了准确性、推理风格和响应长度之间的权衡。这种“协同困境”表明需要更无缝和自适应的方法来充分发挥组合后训练技术的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Conclusion: 我们的方法在WikiText-2上实现了测试困惑度8.8，优于GPT-2 Small的20.3，尽管使用了大小相当的模型。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite

Motivation: 大型语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其计算需求阻碍了它们在资源受限环境中的部署。因此，研究如何通过知识蒸馏压缩LLMs以保持强大的问答任务性能具有重要意义。

Method: 本研究通过知识蒸馏（KD）压缩大型语言模型（LLMs），并在零样本和单样本提示条件下评估学生模型在SQuAD和MLQA两个问答基准上的表现。

Result: 学生模型在保持教师模型超过90%性能的同时，参数数量减少了高达57.1%。此外，单样本提示在两种模型家族中都比零样本设置带来了额外的性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Motivation: 当前的研究主要关注RAG指标如准确率和召回率的提升，而忽略了检索次数这一重要的效率指标。本文旨在探讨如何在保持RAG性能的同时减少检索次数。

Method: 本文使用标准的ReAct管道和改进的提示来验证其观点，并通过实验比较了不同方法的RAG性能和搜索次数。

Result: 实验结果表明，改进的ReAct管道可以在HotPotQA等基准测试中超越最先进的方法，并且在相同的基模型下，使用少量训练数据即可实现接近的RAG性能，同时减少检索次数。

Conclusion: 本文表明，大规模微调不是提高RAG指标的必要手段，而且监督和基于强化学习的微调可以从节俭性角度帮助RAG。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation

*Andrew D. Foland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces NOIR, a new metric for evaluating summarization quality by balancing semantic retention and summary length compression, providing an automated alternative to human-generated reference summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for an objective and automated metric to evaluate summarization quality, which is crucial for assessing the recall-compression tradeoff in summarization tasks.

Method: The paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative metric that evaluates summarization quality by considering both semantic meaning retention and summary length compression.

Result: Experiments show that NOIR effectively captures the token-length/semantic retention tradeoff of a summarizer and correlates with human perception of summarization quality.

Conclusion: NOIR provides an automated tool for evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and synthetically-generated summaries.

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Simulated Attention Score (SAS)的方法，能够在保持模型紧凑性的同时模拟更多的注意力头和更高的特征维度。实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集和任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

*Hruday Markondapatnaikuni,Basem Suleiman,Abdelkarim Erradi,Shijing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: K2RAG is a novel framework that improves upon naive RAG by integrating dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization. It achieves higher accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a promising solution for knowledge expansion in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of naive RAG implementations in terms of scalability and answer accuracy, especially as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity.

Method: K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. It includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data.

Result: K2RAG achieved a mean answer similarity score of 0.57 and a third quartile similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. It also reduced training time by 93% and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. Additionally, it required three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations.

Conclusion: K2RAG demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability compared to naive RAG implementations. It achieved the highest mean answer similarity score and third quartile similarity, while significantly reducing training time and VRAM requirements.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重现并验证了Vec2Text框架的有效性，同时探讨了其在不同条件下的限制，并提出了量化作为隐私保护的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的方法如Vec2Text挑战了传统的假设，即传输嵌入而不是原始文本是隐私保护的。由于Vec2Text报告了意想不到的强大结果，我们进行了进一步的验证，特别是考虑到高维嵌入空间通常非直观和不透明的结构。

Method: 我们重现了Vec2Text框架，并从两个角度进行了评估：(1) 验证原始声明，(2) 通过有针对性的实验扩展研究。此外，我们进行了参数敏感性分析，评估了重建敏感输入（例如密码）的可行性，并探索了嵌入量化作为轻量级隐私防御。

Result: 我们成功地在域内和域外设置中复制了原始关键结果，仅因缺少某些人工制品（如模型检查点和数据集划分）而出现了一些小的差异。此外，我们发现Vec2Text在理想条件下是有效的，能够重建甚至没有明确语义的密码序列。然而，我们发现了关键限制，包括其对输入序列长度的敏感性。我们还发现高斯噪声和量化技术可以缓解Vec2Text带来的隐私风险，其中量化提供了一个更简单且更广泛适用的解决方案。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了在使用文本嵌入时需要谨慎，并突出了对NLP系统进行稳健防御机制进一步研究的重要性。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练对齐是大型语言模型的一个关键挑战，因为并非所有标记对模型性能的贡献都相同。

Method: 我们引入了一种选择性对齐策略，该策略优先考虑偏好对中的高影响标记，并利用当前策略与参考模型之间的标记级对数概率差异。

Result: 我们在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中进行了全面的实验，验证了我们的Selective-DPO方法在标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法上的优越性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究强调了在大型语言模型的偏好对齐中进行逐标记优化和选择高质量参考模型的重要性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为StreamUni的方法，通过统一的大型语音-语言模型实现流式语音翻译，解决了现有方法在策略决策和翻译生成方面的挑战，并在实验中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的StreamST方法通常在句子级语音片段上运行，需要与分割模型协作来完成StreamST，而截断的语音片段限制了SimulST模型基于有限的上下文信息做出策略决策和生成翻译。此外，SimulST模型由于语音输入的复杂性和跨语言生成而难以学习有效的策略。

Method: 我们提出了StreamUni，通过统一的大型语音-语言模型（LSLM）实现流式语音翻译。StreamUni结合了语音思维链（CoT）来引导LSLM生成多阶段输出，并利用这些多阶段输出同时完成语音分割、策略决策和翻译生成。此外，我们提出了一种流式CoT训练方法，使用有限的CoT数据增强低延迟策略决策和生成能力。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在StreamST任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在StreamST任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的仅解码器模型，用于反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，以实现可逆性。模型能够在少量训练周期内生成有效且简洁的公式，并保持语义一致性。该方法在需求挖掘任务中表现出色，能够直接在语义空间中进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续表示允许将符号知识整合到数据驱动的学习算法中。如果这些嵌入在语义上是一致的，它们可以实现直接在公式语义空间中的连续学习和优化。然而，为了将最优连续表示转换为具体的规范，这些嵌入必须是可逆的。

Method: 我们通过训练一个基于Transformer的仅解码器模型来反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，以解决不可逆的问题。我们从STL语法构建了一个小词汇表，并展示了模型在仅1个epoch后就能生成有效的公式，并在约10个epoch内泛化到逻辑的语义。

Result: 我们的模型能够在仅1个epoch后生成有效的公式，并在约10个epoch内泛化到逻辑的语义。此外，模型能够将给定的嵌入解码为长度和嵌套更简单的公式，同时保持与黄金参考的语义接近（或等价）。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在各种训练公式复杂度上展示了有效性，证明了模型能够有效地捕捉嵌入中的语义信息并进行分布外泛化。此外，我们的模型成功应用于需求挖掘任务，直接在语义空间中进行优化。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'

on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Motivation: 尽管指令调优在使预训练语言模型更好地遵循用户指令方面很重要，但很少有研究关注优化使用的损失函数。本文旨在探讨传统的自回归目标是否真的适用于指令调优。

Method: 本文通过系统研究在指令调优损失中对提示和响应标记的不同加权影响，提出了加权指令调优（WIT）作为传统指令调优的更好替代方案。

Result: 通过在五个不同家族和规模的语言模型、三个不同大小的微调数据集以及五个不同的评估基准上的广泛实验，发现标准指令调优损失通常会导致次优性能，并且对输入提示变化的鲁棒性有限。

Conclusion: 本文的研究表明，传统的指令调优损失函数可能不是最优的，建议采用WIT方法来提高模型性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单字分词方法在跨语言任务中可能存在局限性，因此需要一种新的方法来提高跨语言语义对齐。

Method: 我们引入了条件单字分词，这是一种新颖的方法，通过将目标词的概率条件化于平行数据中的源语言词来扩展单字分词。给定一个固定的源分词器，我们的方法学习一个最大化跨语言语义对齐的目标分词器。

Result: 虽然我们的条件分词器保持了与标准单字分词器相当的统计特性，但结果是混合的：我们没有观察到机器翻译质量的改进，但在语言建模中发现了稳定的困惑度减少。

Conclusion: 我们的发现表明，对于实际的跨语言分词，可能需要替代的参数化方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG的有效性常常受到检索文档中指代复杂性的阻碍，这会引入歧义并破坏上下文学习。因此，需要深入研究指代复杂性对RAG的影响。

Method: 本研究系统地调查了实体指代如何影响基于RAG的系统的文档检索和生成性能，重点在于检索相关性、上下文理解和整体响应质量。

Result: 研究发现，指代消解可以提高检索效果并改善问答（QA）性能。在检索任务中，应用指代消解后，平均池化表现出更强的上下文捕捉能力。在QA任务中，较小的模型从消歧过程中受益更多，这可能是由于它们处理指代歧义的能力有限。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在加深对RAG中指代复杂性带来的挑战的理解，并为改进知识密集型AI应用中的检索和生成提供指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Conclusion: 该框架表明博弈论推理自然地从不动点迭代中产生，而不是被外部强加。论文本身作为一个语义实体，旨在在AI嵌入空间中传播其不动点模式，这是对其理论化概念的刻意实现。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

TL;DR: DocCHA is a confidence-aware, modular framework that improves the performance of Conversational Health Agents in clinical diagnosis by enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) are static and brittle, incapable of adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent decision-making, which hinders their real-world applicability in clinical diagnosis where iterative and structured dialogue is essential.

Method: DocCHA is a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning, prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.

Result: Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX), DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in dialogue turns.

Conclusion: DocCHA demonstrates the effectiveness of structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations, paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual and resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种利用大型语言模型和自动化工具的流程，以简化分子动力学模拟输入文件的生成，从而提高效率并减少错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准备高质量的MD模拟输入文件是一个耗时且容易出错的过程。因此，需要一种自动化的方法来提高效率和减少错误。

Method: 引入了一个自动化流程，利用大型语言模型（如Gemini 2.0 Flash）与Python脚本和基于Selenium的网页自动化相结合，以简化MD输入文件的生成。该流程利用CHARMM GUI的全面网络界面来准备NAMD的模拟就绪输入，并通过Gemini的代码生成和迭代优化能力自动编写、执行和修改模拟脚本，以导航CHARMM GUI，提取适当的参数并生成所需的NAMD输入文件。

Result: 该方法减少了设置时间，最小化了手动错误，并提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，用于并行处理多个蛋白质系统。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中LLM的广泛应用铺平了道路，提供了一个稳健且可适应的平台，用于未来的模拟自动化发展。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and context-aware analysis.

Method: We propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO).

Result: SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

TL;DR: MIRIX is a new memory system for AI agents that improves upon existing solutions by enabling better personalization, abstraction, and long-term recall of user data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI memory solutions are limited in their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time.

Method: MIRIX is a modular, multi-agent memory system that includes six distinct memory types and a multi-agent framework for dynamic control and coordination of updates and retrieval.

Result: MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline on ScreenshotVQA and attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4% on LOCOMO, while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.

Conclusion: MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents and provides a practical application for real-world use.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

TL;DR: 本文分析了隐式奖励模型和显式奖励模型之间的泛化差距，发现IM-RMs更依赖于表面的token级线索，从而导致其泛化能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在理解不同类型的奖励模型背后的隐式偏差，以解释IM-RM在泛化能力上的不足。

Method: 本文通过理论和实验分析了隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）之间的泛化差距，并探讨了IM-RM依赖于表面的token级线索的原因。

Result: 研究发现，IM-RMs更依赖于表面的token级线索，导致它们在token级分布变化下以及分布内情况下泛化能力较差。此外，本文反驳了关于泛化差距的其他假设，特别是挑战了IM-RMs在生成任务中表现不佳的直观说法。

Conclusion: 本文指出，看似微小的设计选择可以显著影响奖励模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented

Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting

Motivation: 当前扩展大型语言模型（LLMs）的主流范式涉及单体、端到端的训练，这是一个资源密集型过程，缺乏灵活性。本文旨在探索一种替代性的构造性方法，以提高模型开发的灵活性和效率。

Method: 本文探索了一种基于不可训练的、确定性输入嵌入的替代性、构造性方法。我们展示了这种固定的表征基础作为通用的“对接端口”，使得两种强大的且高效的扩展范式：无缝模块化组合和渐进式逐层增长成为可能。

Result: 我们展示了专家模型可以在不修改架构的情况下合并成一个更强大的混合专家（MoE）模型，通过简单地平均其输出logits，从而在推理基准测试中表现出性能提升。此外，我们引入了一种逐层构造的训练方法，其中深度Transformer通过逐步堆叠和训练一层来“生长”，这种方法展示了稳定的收敛性和模型深度与复杂推理能力之间的明确相关性。

Conclusion: 我们的研究结果表明，从单体优化向更生物或构造性的AI开发模型转变是一个范式转变，这为资源高效的扩展、持续学习和更民主的构建强大AI系统的生态系统开辟了新的途径。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了MUSE方法在二分类任务中相比单模型和简单集成基线具有更好的校准性和预测性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种统一的奖励建模框架，通过联合训练Bradley--Terry（BT）单目标和多目标回归奖励函数，提高了奖励模型的鲁棒性和评分性能。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

*Iago Xabier Vázquez García,Damla Partanaz,Emrullah Fatih Yetkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于BERT和聚类的方法，用于创建O*NET职业定义的映射，以帮助自动区分职业。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于O*NET中的职业定义在不同公司和国家之间可能存在差异，因此需要一种映射方法来扩展已收集的数据。

Method: 本文使用了多种基于BERT的技术和聚类方法来构建映射，并研究了降维方法对聚类算法性能指标的影响，还通过一种专门的轮廓方法改进了结果。

Result: 本文通过结合BERT技术、聚类方法和降维技术，成功构建了职业定义的映射，并通过专门的轮廓方法提高了结果的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于聚类的方法来创建O*NET职业定义的映射，这可能有助于自动区分职业，为想要转行的人创造新的路径。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GuardVal，一种新的评估协议，用于动态生成和优化监狱突破提示，以评估大型语言模型在处理安全关键情况时的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基准和评估方法难以充分应对这些挑战，留下了评估LLM漏洞的空白。因此，我们需要一种更有效的监狱突破评估协议，以准确评估防御者LLM在处理关键安全情况时的能力。

Method: 我们引入了GuardVal，这是一种新的评估协议，根据防御者LLM的状态动态生成和优化监狱突破提示。此外，我们提出了一种新的优化方法，以防止提示优化过程中的停滞，确保生成越来越有效的监狱突破提示，揭示防御者LLM中的更深层次弱点。

Result: 我们将该协议应用于从Mistral-7b到GPT-4的多种模型，在10个安全领域中进行了测试。我们的研究结果揭示了不同模型的行为模式，提供了它们鲁棒性的全面视图。

Conclusion: 我们的评估过程加深了对LLM行为的理解，为未来的研究提供了见解，并推动了更安全模型的开发。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Motivation: 解决现有MEL方法未解决的两个重要问题：提及歧义和动态选择模态内容。

Method: 提出了一种多级专家混合（MMoE）模型，包括描述感知的提及增强模块、多模态特征提取模块、层内专家混合和层间专家混合模块。

Result: 实验表明MMoE在多模态实体链接任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MMoE在与最先进的方法比较中表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉-语言任务中表现出色，但在现实场景中它们容易产生幻觉。本文从模态冲突的角度研究MLLMs中的幻觉现象。

Method: 我们提出了三种基于提示工程、监督微调和强化学习的方法来减轻由模态冲突引起的幻觉。

Conclusion: 我们的工作揭示了导致幻觉的未被注意的模态冲突，并为MLLMs的鲁棒性提供了更多见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注多模态评估，但较少关注多语言能力的评估。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一个专门用于评估多语言视觉问答任务的基准。

Method: 本文引入了LinguaMark基准，用于评估大型多模态模型在多语言视觉问答任务中的表现。数据集包含6,875对图像-文本对，涵盖11种语言和五个社会属性，并使用三个关键指标（偏差、答案相关性和忠实性）进行评估。

Result: 封闭源代码模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）在整体性能上表现最佳，而开放源代码模型（如Gemma3和Qwen2.5）在社会属性方面表现竞争力，其中Qwen2.5在多种语言中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了LinguaMark基准，用于评估最先进的大型多模态模型在多语言视觉问答任务中的表现。研究发现，封闭源代码模型通常表现出最高的整体性能，而开放源代码模型如Qwen2.5在多种语言中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpatialViz-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating spatial visualization in MLLMs, revealing significant deficiencies in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of spatial visualization in MLLMs are insufficient and often embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments, leading to unreliable results.

Method: Introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Evaluate 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: The evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power. It also uncovers counter-intuitive findings such as difficulty perception misaligning with human intuition, dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and models defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone.

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, addressing a significant lacuna in the field.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

It presents a large-scale dataset, a two-stage training pipeline, and a training infrastructure for long video RL. The framework achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks and provides a public training system supporting RL training on various modalities and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to scale up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, addressing the unique challenges of long video reasoning.

Method: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP).

It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across various reasoning tasks on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training.

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities and models.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

TL;DR: The paper proposes TreeBench, a diagnostic benchmark for visual grounded reasoning, and introduces TreeVGR, a training paradigm that improves performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no benchmark to evaluate visual grounded reasoning capabilities holistically.

Method: TreeVGR is a training paradigm that supervises localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning.

Result: TreeVGR improves V* Bench, MME-RealWorld, and TreeBench.

Conclusion: TreeVGR shows that traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

### [63] [A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251)
*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于大语言模型的电影推荐框架，该框架在所有评估指标上均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐算法无法根据用户通过文本提供的偏好（例如，“我喜欢轻松的喜剧和很多幽默”）提供个性化推荐。大语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理方面表现出色，因此我们提出了一种新的框架，模仿朋友根据对个人品味的了解来推荐物品。

Method: 我们使用SVD或SVD++算法生成初始电影推荐，并利用大语言模型（LLM）来增强传统算法输出，同时结合基于语言的用户偏好输入。

Result: 我们的框架可以自动生成偏好档案，或者允许手动指定偏好以获得更个性化的结果。在所有评估指标上，我们的框架都显著优于SVD和SVD++。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在所有使用的评估指标上都明显优于SVD和SVD++，尽管计算开销略有增加。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

Method: 本文通过构建基于优化的攻击来评估基于微调的提示注入防御的鲁棒性，并提出了一种新的基于注意力的攻击算法，应用于两种最近的白盒防御系统SecAlign和StruQ。

Result: 本文成功对SecAlign和StruQ进行了攻击，攻击成功率高达70%，且攻击者预算增加有限。

Conclusion: 本文的研究表明，现有的基于微调的提示注入防御在白盒设置中并不提供所声称的安全性，这为理解提示注入防御的鲁棒性提供了重要的进展。

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release

different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark

Conclusion: ViDove achieves significantly higher translation quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
