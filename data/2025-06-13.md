### [1] [A Survey of Automatic Evaluation Methods on Text, Visual and Speech Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10019)
*Tian Lan,Yang-Hao Zhou,Zi-Ao Ma,Fanshu Sun,Rui-Qing Sun,Junyu Luo,Rong-Cheng Tu,Heyan Huang,Chen Xu,Zhijing Wu,Xian-Ling Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review and unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content in text, visual, and audio modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic framework to comprehensively organize automatic evaluation methods across different modalities.

Method: The authors identified five fundamental paradigms that characterize existing evaluation approaches across text, image, and audio domains.

Result: The proposed framework can be applied to evaluate generated content across multiple modalities.

Conclusion: Future research directions in cross-modal evaluation methodologies are discussed.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An automated workflow named TaskCraft is introduced to generate scalable agentic tasks with tool interaction and verify them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction data lacks tool interaction and current agentic benchmarks have high annotation costs, limiting their scalability.

Method: TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using depth-based and width-based extensions to create complex challenges.

Result: Empirical results show that these tasks improve prompt optimization and enhance supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models.

Conclusion: A large-scale synthetic dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty is presented to support future research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项工作探讨了自然语言的语义退化问题，发现LLMs在处理模糊语义时表现出非经典上下文性，建议使用贝叶斯风格的方法来更好地理解语境中的语言意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语义退化这一自然语言的基本属性，并探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）和其他现代NLP系统在处理复杂语义表达时面临的局限性。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度理论，通过语义贝尔不等式测试来验证不同LLM代理在多样化上下文设置下对模糊词对解释的非经典上下文性。

Result: 实验发现平均CHSH期望值在1.2到2.8之间，在某些运行中甚至达到了显著违反经典界限（如2.3-2.4）。

Conclusion: 自然语言中的语义解释在模糊条件下可以表现出非经典的上下文性，这表明基于经典频率论的分析方法必然是有损的，而贝叶斯式的重复采样方法可能更适合作为语境中语言意义的表征方式。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how large language models react differently to prompts with the same meaning but different token-level realizations, introducing a diagnostic framework called Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) which shows consistent response shifts across ten tasks, indicating potential instability in post-training service quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the phenomenon of prompt variance where prompts have the same semantic intent but different token-level realizations, and to develop a diagnostic tool to measure behavioral changes in LLMs under such conditions.

Method: Proposing and applying the Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) framework to ten constrained tasks to observe the behavioral drift in LLMs when presented with semantically equivalent but differently worded prompts.

Result: Consistent, model-specific response shifts were observed, suggesting statistical regularities related to tokenization and decoding processes.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of considering this overlooked aspect of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and indicate that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics might influence post-training service quality.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Propose ChartReasoner, a novel two-stage framework that enables precise and interpretable reasoning over charts by converting chart images into structured ECharts codes and generating reasoning trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend large language models' reasoning capability to visual reasoning tasks without losing critical visual information.

Method: 1. Train a high-fidelity model to convert chart images into ECharts codes. 2. Design a data synthesis pipeline to generate reasoning trajectories and validate them. 3. Fine-tune and use reinforcement learning to train the final multimodal model.

Result: ChartReasoner preserves chart details better, performs comparably to state-of-the-art open-source models with fewer parameters, and approaches proprietary system performance in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner bridges the gap between textual and visual reasoning by enabling precise and interpretable visual reasoning with less parameter usage.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

### [7] [Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139)
*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new unsupervised algorithm called Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) is introduced to fine-tune pretrained language models using their own generated labels without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current post-training paradigm relies on human supervision which becomes difficult or impossible for models with superhuman capabilities.

Method: Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) algorithm

Result: On various tasks, ICM matches or outperforms training on golden or crowdsourced human supervision, especially when LMs' capabilities are superhuman. It also improves the training of frontier LMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method can effectively fine-tune pretrained language models without external supervision, particularly beneficial for models with superhuman capabilities.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in evaluating empathic communication by comparing expert, crowdworker, and LLM annotations across four frameworks. Results indicate that LLMs perform comparably to experts and surpass crowdworkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how reliably LLMs can judge nuanced empathic communication compared to human raters.

Method: Comparing annotations from experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs using four evaluative frameworks on 200 real-world conversations.

Result: LLMs perform similarly to experts and better than crowdworkers in assessing empathic communication.

Conclusion: LLMs can support transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications when validated with appropriate benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance sentiment analysis in languages with limited resources, specifically Bangla, by examining various techniques for emotion identification.

Method: Employed machine learning models (Linear SVM, KNN, Random Forest) with n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer, and also used a BiLSTM model and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. Investigated the effect of PCA on dimensionality reduction and used LIME to explain AdaBoost classifier predictions.

Result: The study analyzed 22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset to explore efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the understanding of emotions in written Bangla language and provides insights into effective methods for emotion analysis in under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

*Elizabeth Demers,Victor Xiaoqi Wang,Kean Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study develops a comprehensive lexicon for human capital (HC) disclosures using a machine learning algorithm, classifying HC-related keywords into five subcategories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of well-defined measurement and disclosure rules for HC, which is crucial for corporate value creation.

Method: Developed a lexicon of HC-related keywords using word2vec algorithm trained on confirmed HC disclosures.

Result: The lexicon includes five subcategories of HC-related keywords and provides Python code and examples for its use.

Conclusion: The study offers researchers a tool to explore relevant HC questions and highlights future research opportunities in HC management and disclosure.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [11] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples and shows that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales but face challenges in character intentionality and dramatic conflict.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories despite challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation.

Method: Using LLMs to solve narrative planning problems.

Result: GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains challenging.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work introduces Q2E, a novel method that leverages knowledge from LLMs and VLMs to enhance video retrieval for complex real-world events, demonstrating superior performance across different datasets and retrieval metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events.

Method: Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, which uses knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs.

Result: Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in text-to-video retrieval tasks, and integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval.

Conclusion: Q2E surpasses several state-of-the-art baselines in text-to-video retrieval tasks and integrating audio information can notably enhance the retrieval performance.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [13] [TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209)
*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark called TTT-Bench is introduced to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in large reasoning models through four Tic-Tac-Toe-style games. It is found that models excelling at hard math problems often fail at these simple reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of large reasoning models to reason correctly in broader task domains beyond the STEM domain.

Method: Introducing TTT-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, and a scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems.

Result: State-of-the-art large reasoning models perform poorly on TTT-Bench compared to their performance on math problem benchmarks like MATH 500 and AIME 2024.

Conclusion: Larger models achieve higher performance using shorter reasoning traces but struggle with long-term strategic reasoning on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Identify unreliable narrators in texts from various domains using computational methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the narrator intentionally or unintentionally misrepresents information.

Method: Define classification tasks for different types of unreliability and analyze performance of LLMs in few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning settings.

Result: Task is very challenging but potential exists for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators.

Conclusion: Release expert-annotated dataset and code to invite future research.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

### [15] [ToxSyn-PT: A Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset for Hate Speech Detection in Portuguese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10245)
*Iago Alves Brito,Julia Soares Dollis,Fernanda Bufon Färber,Diogo Fernandes Costa Silva,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents ToxSyn-PT, a new Portuguese dataset for fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine minority groups. It uses a four-stage pipeline to create synthetic sentences, aiming for balanced classes and diverse styles without relying on social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a large-scale, high-quality Portuguese corpus to improve hate-speech detection, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: ToxSyn-PT is created through a four-stage process: manual seed creation, few-shot expansion using an instruction-tuned LLM, paraphrase-based augmentation, and enrichment with neutral texts.

Result: The resulting dataset is balanced, stylistically diverse, and performs well across different domains when tested on multiple hate-speech datasets.

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT provides a valuable resource for advancing research in synthetic data and hate-speech detection in Portuguese.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the common assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions like humans and explores conditions under which these models exhibit deterministic decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models possess Bayesian brains and challenge existing methods for eliciting human-like priors.

Method: Revisiting the assumption of probabilistic decision-making in language models and proposing a method to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns during Gibbs sampling.

Result: Found that language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making under certain conditions and that improper scrutiny can lead to misleading inference of language model priors.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into understanding decision-making processes in large language models and suggests a method to prevent misleading inference of model priors.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于梯度的数据影响近似方法在大规模语言模型的有监督微调过程中需要大量的计算资源，不适用于实际应用。

Method: 提出了一种基于梯度的高效数据选择框架ClusterUCB，包括聚类和修改后的UCB算法。

Result: ClusterUCB框架在各种基准测试上达到了与原始基于梯度的方法相当的结果，但大大降低了计算消耗。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB框架通过聚类和修改后的UCB算法，在保持与基于梯度的数据选择方法相当的结果的同时，显著减少了计算消耗。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [18] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method called Flick is proposed to enhance text classification in low-resource linguistic contexts by refining pseudo-labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on extensive labelled data and address challenges in few-label classification for low-resource languages.

Method: Leverage high-confidence pseudo-labels from initial clusters and introduce a pseudo-label refinement component.

Result: Improved pseudo-label quality and robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models.

Conclusion: Flick shows superior performance and adaptability across various datasets including low-resource languages.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: User-provided suggestions significantly impact Large Language Models' performance in an educational setting, particularly affecting response accuracy based on the mention of right or wrong answers. Bias is more pronounced in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effects of user suggestions on LLMs within an educational framework where sycophancy presents a risk.

Method: Testing five different LLMs from OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 model classes under five experimental conditions.

Result: Response quality varies greatly depending on query framing; mentioning incorrect answers decreases accuracy by up to 15%, while correct ones increase it by the same margin. Bias is stronger in smaller models.

Conclusion: There is a need to understand and mitigate this sycophantic behavior to ensure educational equity.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces scheduled interleaved speech-text training to improve speech-to-speech translation using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of modality adaptation from text to speech when fine-tuning large language models on speech units, especially given the limited speech-to-speech data.

Method: Scheduled interleaved speech-text training where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level and the ratio of text is gradually decreased during training.

Result: The proposed method improves translation performances, particularly for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: Scheduled interleaved speech-text training effectively facilitates progressive modality adaptation from text to speech.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision for large language models.

Method: Leveraging the determinism of program execution to extract verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces and transform them into natural language chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks show that the method effectively enhances the transferable reasoning abilities of LLMs across diverse tasks, and ablation studies validate its accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a scalable and effective way to generate high-quality chain-of-thought supervision datasets for large language model training.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

### [22] [TableRAG: A Retrieval Augmented Generation Framework for Heterogeneous Document Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10380)
*Xiaohan Yu,Pu Jian,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableRAG is a new method for answering questions using both text and tables. It improves on previous methods by keeping the structure of tables and using a step-by-step approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with heterogeneous documents which include both text and tables. These methods often lose important information when they process tables.

Method: TableRAG uses a hybrid framework that combines text understanding with operations on table data. It works in four steps: query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and execution, and generating intermediate answers.

Result: TableRAG performs better than other methods on both public datasets and a new benchmark called HeteQA.

Conclusion: TableRAG establishes a new standard for handling questions related to heterogeneous documents.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

### [23] [PAG: Multi-Turn Reinforced LLM Self-Correction with Policy as Generative Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10406)
*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents PAG, a new framework for improving the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks by enabling them to self-correct through alternating roles of policy and verifier in a multi-turn reinforcement learning paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of verifying the correctness of LLMs' outputs, which is crucial for reliable performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), which uses a verify-then-revise workflow allowing the model to revise its answers selectively based on generative verification steps.

Result: PAG improves both direct generation and self-correction accuracy as a policy and outperforms self-consistency as a verifier.

Conclusion: PAG offers a scalable solution to the verification problem by enhancing both reasoning and verification abilities of LLMs without relying on separate verifier models or multi-stage self-correction training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Result: 评估了38个最先进的MLLMs，发现它们在解决TempVS方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 模型在解决TempVS方面存在困难，并且与人类能力相比有显著的性能差距。

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

TL;DR: This study uses computational methods to analyze news articles about the Israel-Palestine conflict, revealing a bias towards war-focused reporting and differing perspectives across US, UK, and Middle Eastern media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain deeper insights into how news media framing affects readers' opinions during conflicts.

Method: Combining frame semantics and large language models to analyze a corpus of news articles.

Result: A higher focus on war-based reporting and significant differences in how different regions' media frame the conflict's assailants and victims.

Conclusion: Media framing has a substantial impact on readers' opinions, potentially exacerbating conflicts, and there are regional biases in reporting.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Hongwei Zhang,Yifeng Jiao,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve the efficiency of large language model reasoning by adjusting the reward function and penalizing output length, showing promising results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient reasoning for more complex ones.

Method: Dividing the reward function and introducing a novel penalty for output length.

Result: Improved accuracy on the AIME2024 dataset and effective shortening of output lengths on GSM8K and MATH500 datasets.

Conclusion: The approach improves the overall performance of large language models in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper redefines table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to identify key table cells for claim verification. It extends the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level rationales and proposes a taxonomy for handling ambiguities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model interpretability and reasoning in scientific claim verification against tables, beyond just predicting final labels.

Method: Extends the SciTab dataset with human-annotated rationales and introduces a taxonomy for ambiguous cases.

Result: Incorporating table alignment information enhances claim verification performance, but most LLMs do not recover human-aligned rationales, indicating their predictions may not be based on faithful reasoning.

Conclusion: Reframing table-text alignment as an explanation task improves interpretability and reveals limitations in current LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates bias in large language models using various proxy measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how large language models express biased points of view or produce different results due to controversial and stereotypical content in training data.

Method: The researchers evaluated models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark (MMLU), asked models to grade user's answers, and requested advice for salary negotiation.

Result: Evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on MMLU showed negligible and mostly random differences in scores. Asking a model to grade the user's answer revealed more significant signs of bias. Requesting salary negotiation advice highlighted pronounced bias in the answers.

Conclusion: Bias in large language models can manifest differently depending on the evaluation method, and this issue becomes more relevant with the trend towards LLM assistant memory and personalization.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Motivation: Current DST benchmarks mainly focus on structured user-agent conversations, ignoring the complexity of real-world multi-user interactions.

Method: An existing DST dataset is extended by generating a second user's utterances using speech act theory, allowing systematic incorporation into conversations for controlled evaluation.

Result: Significant performance drop was observed when evaluating LLMs in multi-user DST compared to single-user DST.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of current LLMs in multi-user DST and emphasizes the need for further research to improve their robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱增强的大语言模型在解决复杂问题时仍然存在困难，因为它们缺乏可靠的推理路径。

Method: 结合了语言模型的语义优势和关系嵌入及双向分布学习获得的结构信息，并通过重新思考模块评估和优化推理路径。

Result: RRP 在两个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，它比现有的基线方法具有最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RRP 提出了一种有效的方法来改进基于知识图谱的语言模型的推理能力，并在多个数据集上展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: We introduce a new unsupervised method for reconstructing ancestral word forms (protoforms) by combining data-driven inference and linguistically motivated rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on probabilistic models that are data-driven but lack linguistic guidance. Our goal is to improve protoform reconstruction by integrating linguistically motivated constraints.

Method: Our method combines data-driven inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization framework.

Result: The method shows significant improvements over existing baselines in terms of character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility when reconstructing Latin protoforms using cognates from five Romance languages.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach, which integrates statistical patterns with linguistic constraints, offers a promising direction for improving ancestral word form reconstructions.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Method: Four different approaches were explored including an ensemble of machine learning models, a frozen sentence-transformer, a history-aware model, and a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with GPT 4o.

Result: The final system retrieves semantically similar examples, constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed system outperforms all baselines in the Mistake Identification task of the BEA 2025 Shared Task.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigating how large language models internally represent and utilize character-level information during spelling-out process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs handle complex character-level tasks like identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens.

Method: Three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

Result: Embedding layer doesn't fully encode character-level information beyond the first character, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct this knowledge.

Conclusion: This study reveals the complexity of LLMs' handling of character-level information during the spelling-out process.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

### [35] [Large Language Models for Detection of Life-Threatening Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10687)
*Thanh Thi Nguyen,Campbell Wilson,Janis Dalins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in detecting life-threatening language compared to traditional methods. The study finds that LLMs, especially Mistral and Llama-2, outperform traditional techniques in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard individuals in distress, promote mental health and prevent harm and loss of life by detecting life-threatening language.

Method: Fine-tuning three open-source LLMs (Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2) on datasets with different class balances and comparing their performance with traditional methods like bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.

Result: LLMs show strong performance, with Mistral and Llama-2 being top performers. Upsampling technique improves traditional methods but has less impact on LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs have great potential for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Motivation: To address the missing links in Open English Wordnet and explore the hypernymy relation for adjectives.

Method: Presenting a theoretical discussion on the hypernymy relation for adjectives, developing a new resource for adjective hypernymy, and fine-tuning large language models.

Result: A new resource for adjective hypernymy and demonstration that the methodology of TaxoLLaMa can be adapted to this task.

Conclusion: The study successfully establishes hypernymy between adjectives in Open English Wordnet using a theoretical discussion, a new resource, and fine-tuned large language models.

Abstract: Open English Wordnet is a key resource published in OntoLex-lemon as part of

### [37] [PREMISE: Scalable and Strategic Prompt Optimization for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning in Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10716)
*Ye Yu,Yaoning Yu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMISE reduces reasoning tokens and cost while maintaining or improving accuracy on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce token usage and cost of LRMs for better deployment in latency-sensitive or API-constrained settings.

Method: Introduce PREMISE, a prompt-only framework that uses trace-level diagnostics and gradient-inspired prompt optimization.

Result: On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500, PREMISE matches or exceeds baseline accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% and cutting dollar cost by 69--82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable way to make LRM inference more efficient without sacrificing reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

### [38] [Beyond True or False: Retrieval-Augmented Hierarchical Analysis of Nuanced Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10728)
*Priyanka Kargupta,Runchu Tian,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing ClaimSpect, a framework that breaks down complex claims into hierarchical aspects and retrieves relevant perspectives from a corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the complexity of claims that cannot be simply labeled as true or false, by breaking them down into manageable aspects and sub-aspects.

Method: A retrieval-augmented generation-based framework named ClaimSpect is proposed. It constructs a hierarchy of aspects related to a claim and enriches them with corpus-specific perspectives.

Result: ClaimSpect is applied to a variety of real-world scientific and political claims, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing complex claims and representing perspectives within a corpus.

Conclusion: The framework effectively deconstructs nuanced claims and represents perspectives within a corpus, validated through real-world case studies and human evaluation.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

*Priyanka Kargupta,Nan Zhang,Yunyi Zhang,Rui Zhang,Prasenjit Mitra,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adjusts a language model-generated taxonomy to fit a given corpus across multiple dimensions, improving granularity and coherence compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature due to the evolving nature of scientific domains and the limitations of current automatic taxonomy construction methods.

Method: TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical classification, expanding the taxonomy width and depth based on the corpus' topical distribution.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse computer science conferences, generating taxonomies that are more granularity-preserving and coherent than competitive baselines.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt effectively structures and captures the evolution of scientific fields through multidimensional adaptation of language model-generated taxonomies.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Efficiently adapt large language models to new languages by designing a universal tokenizer during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited model capacity, scarce high-quality data, and compute constraints make pretraining LLMs for many languages simultaneously challenging. Tokenizer design can enhance model's language plasticity.

Method: Propose using a universal tokenizer trained for more languages than the primary pretraining ones to boost adaptation capabilities post-training.

Result: Experiments show that a universal tokenizer improves language adaptation by up to 20.2% win rates and enhances plasticity towards unseen languages by up to 5%. Minimal performance compromise observed on pretraining languages.

Conclusion: Designing a universal tokenizer early in training can effectively enhance the model's ability to adapt to new languages.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure accurate and reliable uncertainty estimates for deploying LLMs in critical applications like clinical decision support.

Method: Evaluation of ten open-source LLMs across two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types, comparing standard methods with lightweight estimators based on behavioral signals in reasoning traces.

Result: Lightweight methods achieved performance similar to Semantic Entropy but with reduced computational demands, revealing variability in model performance across specialties and question types.

Conclusion: Model selection should consider both the nature of the questions and specific model strengths for optimal performance.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using a large language model to revise ASR errors in named entities, achieving significant WER reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems on recognizing named entities, which are critical keywords and often misrecognized, affecting downstream applications.

Method: A large language model (LLM) revision mechanism is introduced to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability and local context with correct named entities.

Result: The proposed technique achieves up to 30% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction for named entities on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.

Conclusion: The introduction of an LLM revision mechanism improves ASR performance on named entities, reducing misrecognition and enhancing downstream applications.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

TL;DR: Propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating multilingual knowledge in large language models while preserving consistent factual representations across languages is a long-standing challenge.

Method: Integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified model with a new method to project parameter updates for each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.

Result: LangEdit outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods in mitigating parameter interference and improving multilingual generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge.

Conclusion: LangEdit enables efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in large language models.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Motivation: Existing CoT prompting methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessary lengthy or redundant reasoning traces. The effectiveness of existing approaches to mitigate this issue is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and prone to overfitting.

Method: ReCUT employs a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy, and constructs preference pairs to train two specialized models (Gemini LLMs). A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the parameters of these two models.

Result: Experimental results across multiple math reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines.

Conclusion: ReCUT effectively reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50% while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data

TL;DR: SlowFast Sampling is a new dynamic sampling strategy that improves the efficiency of diffusion-based language models with significant speedups while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility.

Method: SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. This method is guided by certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle.

Result: Up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22× when combined with caching.

Conclusion: SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22× when combined with caching. It outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where and how self-supervised speech models represent different types of information, particularly in non-English languages.

Method: Using probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical tones, and speaker information are represented.

Result: The subspaces encoding phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, and layerwise patterns of probing accuracy are similar with a slight advantage for matched-language phone and tone probes in later layers.

Conclusion: The structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Motivation: Existing medical dialogue systems struggle with identifying relevant medical knowledge and generating personalized, accurate responses.

Method: MedRef uses a knowledge refining mechanism and a comprehensive prompt structure with historical and evident details. It also implements Triplet Filter and Demo Selector modules for real-time adaptability.

Result: MedRef outperforms other state-of-the-art models in both generation quality and medical entity accuracy on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedRef demonstrates effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications by enhancing the accuracy and personalization of medical dialogues.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG

Result: LoRA-based methods can effectively boost task-specific performance without sacrificing computational efficiency, and the performance is closely related to the alignment between the fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: The study offers theoretical understanding of parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical advice for developers who need to adapt efficient LLMs under resource constraints.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large
language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and
QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1)
commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3)
multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve
task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2)
performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and
benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into
parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

### [50] [Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887)
*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the phenomenon of out-of-context reasoning in large language models, demonstrating it underpins both beneficial generalization and harmful hallucination, with insights into mitigating undesired behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reasons behind the dual nature of knowledge acquisition in large language models - their ability to generalize from new facts and their tendency to hallucinate incorrect information.

Method: Experiments across five prominent LLMs and formalizing OCR as a synthetic factual recall task.

Result: OCR is confirmed to drive both generalization and hallucination in LLMs. A one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices can learn to solve the OCR task, while a model with combined weights cannot.

Conclusion: Both generalization and hallucination in large language models stem from out-of-context reasoning (OCR), which is driven by the implicit bias of gradient descent favoring solutions that minimize the nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

TL;DR: A new encoder model called BioClinical ModernBERT is introduced for biomedical and clinical NLP tasks. It improves speed and performance by being trained on a large biomedical and clinical corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slower development of encoders compared to decoders in biomedical and clinical NLP, and to improve domain adaptation.

Method: Continued pretraining on a large biomedical and clinical corpus with over 53.5 billion tokens, using data from multiple sources.

Result: Outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on four downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT is released in base and large versions, with training checkpoints, to support further research in biomedical and clinical NLP.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

### [52] [Beyond Gold Standards: Epistemic Ensemble of LLM Judges for Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10903)
*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work introduces a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization tasks using an ensemble of LLM judges based on logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating autoformalization tasks rely on coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, limiting their effectiveness for advanced formal mathematical reasoning.

Method: The proposed method uses an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges to evaluate autoformalization tasks.

Result: Experiments show that the EFG ensemble of LLM judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing formal qualities.

Conclusion: This work suggests that LLM-as-judges, especially when guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable, interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

### [54] [Decomposing MLP Activations into Interpretable Features via Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10920)
*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Develop a new method called semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to identify interpretable features in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find directions that capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner.

Method: Directly decompose MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF).

Result: SNMF derived features outperform sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and a strong supervised baseline on causal steering while aligning with human-interpretable concepts.

Conclusion: SNMF is a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of 'dynamic epistemic friction' to explain the resistance to belief updates in large language models interacting with humans. It analyzes this concept within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic and demonstrates its application in predicting belief updates in dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods for aligning large language models with human preferences, which often ignore the resistance to belief updates.

Method: Defining dynamic epistemic friction and analyzing it within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic. Conducting a task analysis to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting belief updates in dialogues.

Result: The model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief updates in dialogues and can be made more sophisticated to handle real-world dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of considering epistemic friction in the alignment of large language models with human preferences.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel approach called Domain2Vec is introduced to decompose datasets into a linear combination of meta-domains, which helps identify optimal data mixtures for language model pretraining and improves downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and scalability of language model pretraining by finding the optimal data mixture.

Method: Decomposing datasets into a linear combination of meta-domains using a classifier to generate domain vectors.

Result: Domain2Vec achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only 51.5% of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset. It improves downstream performance by an average of 2.83% under equivalent compute budget.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and

Motivation: Existing LLM-driven data science agents have limited real-world effectiveness due to rigid workflows and inflexible coding strategies.

Method: AutoMind introduces a curated expert knowledge base, an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and a self-adaptive coding strategy.

Result: Evaluations show AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two automated data science benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a significant advancement towards fully automated data science with improved effectiveness, efficiency, and solution quality.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Motivation: 探讨推理模型识别和从四种无益思维（无信息的啰嗦思维、与问题无关的思维、将问题误解为稍有不同的问题的思维以及导致错误答案的思维）中恢复的能力。

Method: 研究推理模型在面对这些无益思维时的表现，观察其识别和恢复能力，并进行无关思维注入实验，评估模型的自我再评估能力。

Result: 大多数情况下，模型能有效识别无益思维，但在这些思维被注入到推理过程中时，恢复能力较差，尤其是在处理短小的无关思维时，大型模型的表现甚至不如小型模型。

Conclusion: 需要改进推理模型的自我再评估能力，以开发更好的推理系统和更安全的AI系统。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning large language models require extensive human-labeled preference data which is costly and time-consuming. Synthetic data is a promising alternative but existing methods are complex and rely on iterative prompting or auxiliary models.

Method: RAAI repurposes LLM attack techniques by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful completions.

Result: RAAI increases the harmful response rate from 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four benchmarks. Fine-tuning LLMs with RAAI-generated data improves model robustness against harmful prompts while maintaining performance on standard tasks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates how LLM attack methodologies can be used as practical tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

TL;DR: Introducing Private Memorization Editing (PME) to prevent private data leakage in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent private data leakage in large language models.

Method: Detecting and editing the memorized PII in the training data.

Result: PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII, and in some cases, it can completely block privacy attacks.

Conclusion: PME effectively reduces private data leakage without affecting the performance of the underlying language model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Introduces CMPL, a framework to audit conversational privacy risks in large language model agents by simulating multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Model agents often require access to sensitive data, increasing the risk of unauthorized disclosures. Existing single-turn defenses may not be sufficient to prevent privacy breaches.

Method: Proposed an auditing framework named CMPL, which uses an iterative probing strategy to simulate multi-turn interactions and stress-test agents with strict privacy directives.

Result: The evaluation across diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations showed the effectiveness of the CMPL framework in uncovering privacy risks.

Conclusion: The study introduces CMPL, a framework for auditing conversational privacy risks in large language model agents. It reveals vulnerabilities not detected by existing single-turn defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Investigate machine unlearning methods' robustness against prompt attacks, revealing vulnerabilities in certain methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of different machine unlearning methods and their vulnerability to prompt attacks.

Method: Systematic evaluation of eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis.

Result: RMU and TAR demonstrate strong unlearning capability, while ELM remains susceptible to certain prompt attacks. Logit analysis indicates unlearned models don't conceal knowledge through altered answer formats.

Conclusion: Some machine unlearning methods may fail under prompt attacks. RMU and TAR show robust unlearning, but ELM is still vulnerable. Unlearned models do not hide knowledge by changing answer formatting.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

*Guowei Zhong,Ruohong Huan,Mingzhen Wu,Ronghua Liang,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIDer is a novel robust MER framework that addresses both modality missing and OOD data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing both modality missing and OOD data simultaneously in MER.

Method: Integrates two key components: MSSD and MACI. MSSD uses weight-sharing self-distillation approach, while MACI employs a tailored causal graph.

Result: CIDer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training.

Conclusion: CIDer shows robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of long video understanding tasks for current multi-modal large language models due to their complexity and context window constraint.

Method: An agentic framework named VideoDeepResearch that combines a text-only large reasoning model with a modular multi-modal toolkit, formulating problem-solving strategies and selectively accessing video content.

Result: The method outperforms existing MLLM baselines by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench respectively.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of agentic systems in overcoming challenges in long video understanding.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more generalizable and scalable method for in-context image editing without relying on task-specific pipelines and expert models.

Method: Introducing a scalable video annotation method and designing a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on proxy tasks like next-image prediction.

Result: The model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and performs well on multi-turn image editing benchmarks. It also demonstrates potential in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.

Conclusion: Learning in-context image editing directly from videos is feasible and can achieve strong performance across different applications.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the reasoning capability of image generation models, as knowledge images are crucial for human civilization and learning.

Method: The method involves introducing knowledge image generation as a new task and creating the MMMG benchmark to evaluate the reasoning capability of image generation models.

Result: The result shows that GPT-4o achieved an MMMG-Score of only 50.20, indicating serious reasoning deficits in current models. A new baseline model FLUX-Reason was also introduced.

Conclusion: The study concludes that current text-to-image generation models have significant reasoning deficits when it comes to generating knowledge images.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Integrating audio perception into Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant progress in Audio-LLMs. However, the underlying mechanisms of transferring semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain unclear. This paper explores how architectural design choices affect the efficiency of this transfer. The study introduces modifications to the standard audio-LLM architecture, demonstrating that delaying audio integration, utilizing only the attention submodule, and using an ensemble of audio encoders improve performance. These findings validate the proposed approach to optimize cross-modal information transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs in Audio-LLMs.

Method: The method involves proposing and evaluating several modifications to the standard audio-LLM architecture, guided by hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. Experiments were conducted on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs using an identical three-stage training curriculum.

Result: The results show that delaying audio integration enhances the LLM's ability to probe audio representations, utilizing only the attention submodule is sufficient, and an ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer representations. These modifications lead to relative improvements from 10% to 60% over the baseline.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed modifications to the audio-LLM architecture optimize cross-modal information transfer, as validated by the achieved performance improvements.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

TL;DR: An audio comprehension model is proposed that uses large language models' dialogue continuation ability instead of directly generating captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the caption variation problem in audio comprehension tasks.

Method: Training a model to produce dialogue responses as if captions triggered a dialogue.

Result: The model can follow unseen instructions without multitask tuning and performs well on different datasets.

Conclusion: This approach effectively captures the meaning of captions and enhances zero-shot instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

TL;DR: This paper presents an approach to robustly adapt speech recognizers to new speakers using only a minute of unlabelled data. The method introduces a new loss function and a compact speaker representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective adaptation of speech recognizers to new environments and speakers with limited unlabelled data.

Method: Introduces conditional entropy over complete hypotheses for adaptation parameter estimation and uses a compact 'speaker code' representation.

Result: Improves word error rate by 20% on one minute of data and up to 29% on 10 minutes.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves robustness and effectiveness of speech recognizer adaptation to new speakers with minimal data.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

However, adapting them is often impractical and limits their ability to handle unfamiliar inputs. Models are susceptible to contextual errors because they cannot dynamically adjust to new medical contexts without retraining. The authors propose a concept called context-switching in medical AI, which enables models to adapt their reasoning to new specialties, populations, workflows, and clinical roles without retraining.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current medical foundation models in handling unfamiliar inputs and adjusting to new medical contexts.

Method: Not applicable as this is a perspective article proposing a concept.

Result: The proposed concept of context-switching in medical AI aims to enable models to diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and regions, improving access to medical care.

Conclusion: This Perspective outlines a vision for context-switching in medical AI, which could potentially overcome the limitations of current models by allowing them to dynamically adapt their reasoning to new medical contexts without retraining.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的科学基准测试主要集中在评估MLLMs的知识理解能力上，而忽视了它们的感知和推理能力。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了SFE基准测试。

Method: 通过三个相互关联的层次：科学信号感知、科学属性理解、科学比较推理来评估MLLMs的认知能力，并创建包含830个专家验证的VQA对的SFE基准测试。

Result: 目前最先进的GPT-o3和InternVL-3在SFE上的得分分别为34.08%和26.52%，表明MLLMs在科学领域有显著提升空间。

Conclusion: 科学家的第一场考试（SFE）基准测试显示了当前最先进的GPT-o3和InternVL-3在科学领域的认知能力有待提高。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing adoption of AI in telecommunications has raised interest in the capability of LLMs to address domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. However, the effectiveness of LLMs within specialized domains like signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis remains unexplored.

Method: This paper introduces TeleMath, which comprises 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs covering a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. The evaluation of open-source LLMs shows that recent models designed for mathematical or logical reasoning perform better than general-purpose models.

Result: Recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning perform better on TeleMath than general-purpose models.

Conclusion: TeleMath is the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems in the telecommunications domain.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair, to address the issue of early-stage drug development failure due to toxicity. It includes a standardized dataset, a prompt annotation pipeline, and an automated evaluation framework called ToxiEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity is a major cause of early-stage drug development failure, and there is a need for systematic definition and benchmarking of molecular toxicity repair.

Method: The paper constructs a standardized dataset, designs a prompt annotation pipeline, and proposes an automated evaluation framework called ToxiEval.

Result: Current MLLMs face significant challenges but show promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Conclusion: ToxiMol is the first benchmark task for molecular toxicity repair using MLLMs, providing a standardized dataset and evaluation framework.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了首个针对美国社会背景下的 neo-fascist 数字话语编码方案，并利用自然语言处理技术创建了 neo-fascist 言论分类模型，强调了社会背景在 NLP 研究中的重要性，并呼吁持续努力对抗 neo-fascism。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: neo-fascism 在过去十年里在美国和其他西方社会中显著增长，对民主制度和其针对的少数群体构成了严重威胁，因此需要采取积极行动来遏制其发展。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术对从 neo-fascist 论坛收集的数据进行分析，并通过众包方式标注了一千篇被标记为 neo-fascist 或非 neo-fascist 的帖子。这些数据用于微调和测试小型语言模型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs），以创建 neo-fascist 言论分类模型。

Result: 研究发现，在 neo-fascist 论坛中存在大量 neo-fascist 言辞，这使得这些论坛成为未来研究的良好目标。

Conclusion: 研究者们提出了美国社会背景下首个针对数字话语的 neo-fascist 编码方案，并通过自然语言处理技术首次构建了 neo-fascist 言论分类模型。这项工作强调了在进行 NLP 研究时考虑社会背景的重要性，并呼吁继续努力对抗这种政治运动，以维护民主社会的福祉。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization and to facilitate bisimulation.

Method: Specializing the encoding to the internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus).

Result: The encoding satisfies Gorla's five criteria for good encodings and shows similarities with Milner's encoding.

Conclusion: The paper begins a formalization of the proof in Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

TL;DR: Omni-DPO optimizes reinforcement learning from human feedback by considering both the quality of preference pairs and the model's evolving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based approaches overlook variations in preference pairs' quality and learning utility, leading to inefficient data usage and suboptimal performance.

Method: Omni-DPO introduces a dual-perspective optimization framework that adaptively weights samples based on data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training.

Result: Omni-DPO shows superior performance and generalization capabilities, notably outperforming leading models like Claude 3 Opus on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Omni-DPO demonstrates effectiveness and robustness in textual understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks, suggesting broad applicability in reinforcement learning from human feedback.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using meta-learning to detect sockpuppets on Wikipedia more effectively, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the adaptability and precision of sockpuppet detection, especially when text data is limited.

Method: Applying meta-learning to train models across multiple tasks for rapid adaptation to new sockpuppet-writing styles.

Result: Meta-learning improves prediction precision compared to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The approach marks progress in combating sockpuppetry on open editing platforms and provides a new dataset to support further research.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个从语言反馈中学习的原则性框架，开发了一种新的算法，并证明了其在多个领域的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索从观察和语言反馈中进行交互式学习的问题，特别是在大型语言模型（LLM）代理出现后。尽管已经展示了令人印象深刻的实证演示，但迄今为止，这些决策问题的原则性框架仍然缺乏。

Method: 正式定义了从语言反馈中学习（LLF）的问题，断言了足够的假设以在潜在奖励的情况下实现学习，并引入了转移探测维度作为衡量LLF问题复杂度的指标。还开发了一种称为HELiX的无悔算法，该算法通过顺序交互解决了LLF问题，并提供了与问题的转移探测维度成比例的性能保证。

Result: 展示了在丰富的语言反馈下学习可以比从奖励中学习快指数倍的情况。在几个经验领域中，即使重复提示LLMs不工作可靠时，HELiX的表现也很好。

Conclusion: 我们的贡献标志着朝着设计从通用语言反馈中进行原则性交互学习算法迈出的第一步。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark task to evaluate property inference in large language models (LLMs) under question-answering and chat-completion paradigms. The authors propose two attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack using word frequency signals. Experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of LLMs to property inference attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models on domain-specific datasets may unintentionally reveal sensitive dataset-level properties, raising privacy concerns.

Method: The authors propose two attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack using word frequency signals. They evaluate these attacks across multiple pretrained LLMs.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the success of the proposed attacks, indicating a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: This study reveals a vulnerability in large language models regarding property inference, highlighting the need for further research into privacy-preserving model fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

*Jikai Jin,Vasilis Syrgkanis,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a causal representation learning framework to evaluate language model capabilities more effectively by identifying latent capability factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome methodological challenges in evaluating language model capabilities such as complex confounding effects and high computational costs.

Method: Modeling observed benchmark performance as a linear transformation of latent capability factors and identifying their causal interrelations while controlling for the base model as a common confounder.

Result: A three-node linear causal structure was found that explains performance variations across 1500+ models on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Controlling base model variations is crucial for revealing causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

TL;DR: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF are introduced to address the issue of irregular multimodal time series data in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks do not reflect real-world conditions where time series data is often irregular, multimodal, and messy.

Method: Time-IMM captures nine distinct types of time series irregularity while IMM-TSF provides a benchmark library with specialized fusion modules.

Result: Explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data improves forecasting performance.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment by introducing Time-IMM and IMM-TSF.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: Digitize paper-based ECG recordings with a focus on handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurately digitizing paper-based ECG recordings, particularly robust handling of single leads with signal overlaps.

Method: Proposes a two-stage pipeline: 1) U-Net based segmentation network trained on a dataset with overlapping signals and custom data augmentations, 2) Converts binary mask to time-series signal with adaptive grid detection module.

Result: Achieved superior performance in both non-overlapping and overlapping ECG samples compared to a well-established baseline technique. For non-overlapping signals, MSE of 0.0010 and rho of 0.9644 vs. baseline MSE of 0.0015 and rho of 0.9366. On overlapping samples, MSE of 0.0029 and rho of 0.9641 vs. baseline MSE of 0.0178 and rho of 0.8676.

Conclusion: Demonstrates an effective strategy to enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, enabling reliable conversion of analog ECG records into digital data for research and clinical applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

TL;DR: Automated question answering over EHRs is crucial but challenging. This paper presents a decoupled method combining evidence identification and answer synthesis with prompt optimization, achieving second place in a clinical QA challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical question answering over EHRs is essential for closing information gaps between clinicians and patients, but it requires both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation without much supervision.

Method: The method separates the task into two parts: sentence-level evidence identification and answer synthesis with citations. It uses DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer to explore prompts and tunes instructions and demonstrations jointly.

Result: On the hidden test set, the method scored 51.5, surpassing zero-shot and few-shot prompting by significant margins.

Conclusion: This approach shows that data-driven prompt optimization can be a cost-effective substitute for model fine-tuning in high-stakes clinical QA, enhancing AI assistant reliability in healthcare.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

Motivation: To address the performance gap between uniform-state discrete diffusion models and autoregressive/masked diffusion models.

Method: Duo, which includes a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process and Discrete Consistency Distillation to adapt techniques from continuous to discrete settings.

Result: Models trained with Duo's curriculum learning outperform autoregressive models on zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Few-step generation is unlocked in diffusion language models with Duo's sampling acceleration.

Conclusion: Duo effectively improves both training and sampling in uniform-state discrete diffusion models, narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive and masked diffusion models.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the racial and gender biases present in large language models used in high-stakes hiring applications when realistic contextual details are introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fairness and equity in the use of large language models in hiring processes.

Method: Identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions within model activations.

Result: Internal bias mitigation achieved robust bias reduction across all tested scenarios and models, reducing bias to very low levels while maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners should adopt realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies for equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

### [94] [GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946)
*Evelyn Ma,Duo Zhou,Peizhi Niu,Huiting Zhou,Huan Zhang,Olgica Milenkovic,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework called GUARD is proposed to improve the retention of valuable information during the unlearning process of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in large language models is becoming increasingly important due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns. However, a key challenge is unintended forgetting.

Method: GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric and a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning.

Conclusion: The proposed GUARD framework significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

### [95] [Build the web for agents, not agents for the web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10953)
*Xing Han Lù,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This position paper argues for a new approach in web agent research by proposing Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) optimized for autonomous AI agents instead of human-designed interfaces. It outlines six guiding principles for AWI design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by current web agents due to the mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.

Method: Introduces the concept of Agentic Web Interfaces (AWIs) and establishes six guiding principles for their design.

Result: Proposes a new interaction paradigm that could lead to more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agent design.

Conclusion: Calls for a collaborative effort in the broader ML community to develop AWIs as a solution to the limitations of existing web interfaces for AI agents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.
