*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a new dataset for adverse event extraction from elderly patient discharge summaries, highlighting challenges in detecting underrepresented events and nuances in clinical language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources.

Method: The study evaluated multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation.

Result: Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieved strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction but performance dropped notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks, especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: Despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AE events and capturing nuanced clinical language.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model M to map unstructured input text x to output text y representing structured objects. These approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints during training, which can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) overcomes this problem by combining constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time for structured NLP tasks.

Method: Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD) combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model M twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction.

Result: The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance.

Conclusion: BoostCD demonstrates its effectiveness by applying it to closed information extraction. The model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces CrEst, a new method for evaluating the credibility of context documents during LLM inference, improving performance across various tasks and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the credibility of context documents, which can lead to unreliable information being propagated.

Method: CrEst uses inter-document agreement to estimate credibility and proposes two integration strategies for LLM inference.

Result: CrEst outperforms strong baselines in accuracy and F1 score across different model architectures and datasets, and maintains robust performance under high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: CrEst is a novel weakly supervised framework that improves the performance of LLMs by assessing the credibility of context documents.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce MDBench, a novel synthetic dataset for evaluating LLMs on multi-document reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-document reasoning is important for LLMs but lacks rigorous benchmarks due to the high cost of annotation.

Method: Create MDBench through a synthetic generation process using condensed structured seed knowledge modified by LLM-assisted edits.

Result: MDBench presents significant challenges for popular LLMs and prompting techniques, even with short document sets.

Conclusion: The knowledge-guided generation technique allows for targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and can adapt to new challenges and future modeling improvements.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study tests the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting diabetes using various prompting methods and compares them with traditional machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of LLMs for structured numerical data in diabetes prediction.

Method: Conducted an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD) and tested six LLMs, including open-source and proprietary models.

Result: Proprietary LLMs performed better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy. Gemma-2-27B also outperformed traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

Conclusion: LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches is encouraged.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: It's possible to create reversible sentence embeddings for LLMs without changing their weights by using a special memory token.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To observe an interesting phenomenon regarding LLMs' capabilities.

Method: Introduce a special memory token and optimize its embedding through training on a fixed sequence.

Result: Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences up to 240 tokens in English and Spanish datasets.

Conclusion: LLMs have an interesting capability which could be applied in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses NLP to identify social isolation and loneliness in suicide narratives, finding specific groups at higher risk and suggesting improved surveillance and prevention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing social isolation and loneliness have been contributing to rising suicide rates.

Method: Using topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers to identify social isolation and loneliness in law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives.

Result: High-quality classifiers were developed with an average F1 score of .86 and accuracy of .82. The study identified 1,198 cases mentioning chronic social isolation among over 300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020.

Conclusion: Men, gay individuals, and divorced people had higher odds of being classified as chronically socially isolated. Predictors for other social isolation topics were also found.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT is proposed to evaluate open-ended long-form generation and guide its training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often miss key aspects or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem.

Method: PrefBERT is trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality.

Result: PrefBERT provides better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore and remains reliable across varied long passages.

Conclusion: Human evaluations confirm that PrefBERT improves responses alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effect of learning-time knowledge encoding on the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of large language models in the real world requires the ability to 'unlearn' specific pieces of knowledge for various reasons such as privacy regulations and correcting outdated or harmful content.

Method: Empirical investigation of how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge.

Result: Two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.

Conclusion: Learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve dialogue discourse parsing by resolving ambiguities introduced by linguistic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers.

Method: We propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications.

Result: Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Conclusion: Our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces CKD-EHR, a framework using knowledge distillation to improve disease risk prediction accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current large language models in representing medical knowledge and deploying efficiently in clinics.

Method: A teacher model Qwen2.5-7B is fine-tuned with medical data, generating soft labels via attention distillation, transferred to a lightweight BERT student model.

Result: On the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR boosts diagnostic accuracy by 9%, F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2 times faster inference.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective technical method for optimizing resources in clinical settings.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage framework for open-domain dialogue generation in LLMs, enhancing response diversity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model the one-to-many property of open-domain dialogue and improve response diversity and quality in LLM-based dialogue agents.

Method: Decomposing OD generation into Multi-Response Generation and Preference-based Selection tasks, introducing o2mDial corpus, and proposing new strategies and evaluation metrics.

Result: The proposed framework enhances response diversity and quality while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%.

Conclusion: Modeling the one-to-many property of open-domain dialogue in LLMs can significantly boost response diversity and quality.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer that boosts efficiency by reducing token fertility without affecting model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a more efficient Korean tokenizer that reduces token fertility without sacrificing model performance.

Method: Rule-based pre-tokenization aligned with Korean linguistic structure, creation of a seed vocabulary resembling linguistic units, and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm were used.

Result: Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by 10%, improves inference speed by 10%, and maintains performance across various downstream tasks compared to BPE.

Conclusion: Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer, successfully reduces token fertility by 10% without affecting model performance, enhancing inference speed by 10%. This linguistically informed approach proves effective and practical for creating efficient tokenizers.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

### [14] [Emergence of Primacy and Recency Effect in Mamba: A Mechanistic Point of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15156)
*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores memory mechanisms in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects, identifying three key processes: persistent encoding for long-term memory, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term memory, and dynamic modulation by semantic regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how state-space language models retain and forget information over time using behavioral tools like primacy and recency effects.

Method: Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture and analyzing its behavior.

Result: Identified three memory mechanisms: persistent encoding for early tokens, exponential decay for recent inputs, and semantic regularity affecting memory allocation.

Conclusion: Memory in state-space language models involves distinct processes for long-term and short-term memory, influenced by semantic context.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates different LLMs and task adaptation techniques for SDG-related text classification, finding that optimized smaller models can perform as well as larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking progress towards the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals is challenging due to the extensive and complex data involved. Text classification models, especially LLMs, are useful tools for this task.

Method: Analyzing various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs, evaluating Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning techniques.

Result: Smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT.

Conclusion: Optimized smaller models can be effective for SDG-related text classification tasks.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

*Feng He,Zijun Chen,Xinnian Liang,Tingting Ma,Yunqi Qiu,Shuangzhi Wu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method called ProtoReasoning is proposed to improve the reasoning ability of Large Reasoning Models by using scalable and verifiable prototypical representations. It shows improvements in logical reasoning, planning, general reasoning, and mathematics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms supporting the transfer capabilities of Large Reasoning Models trained with Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Method: Proposes ProtoReasoning, which includes an automated prototype construction pipeline, a comprehensive verification system, and scalability to synthesize problems within prototype space.

Result: Achieves improvements in various tasks including logical reasoning, planning, general reasoning, and mathematics, and demonstrates enhanced generalization in ablation studies.

Conclusion: Learning in prototype space enhances generalizable reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

### [17] [MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15215)
*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MinosEval, a new evaluation method for open-ended question answering tasks performed by large language models. MinosEval distinguishes between factoid and non-factoid questions and uses different strategies for ranking answers accordingly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more refined and interpretable automatic evaluation method for open-ended question answering tasks that can capture semantic similarities and offer intuitive interpretability.

Method: Proposes MinosEval which uses adaptive key-point scoring for factoid questions and instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid questions.

Result: Experiments show MinosEval aligns better with human annotations and provides more interpretable results.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses the limitations of traditional metrics and current LLM-based evaluation approaches for open-ended question answering tasks.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea,Itziar Gonzalez-Dios,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language variations using NLI tasks and a new parallel dataset. It finds a performance drop when dealing with linguistic variation, especially in Basque.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capacity of current language technologies in understanding Basque and Spanish language varieties.

Method: Using Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introducing a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Conducting crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: There's a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. The decline isn't due to lexical overlap but the linguistic variation itself. Encoder-only models struggle more with Western Basque.

Conclusion: The study reveals challenges in handling linguistic variation with current language technologies, especially for peripheral dialects like Western Basque.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Thunder-DeID, a de-identification framework for Korean court judgments that includes constructing a legal dataset, categorizing PII systematically, and developing a DNN-based pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring open access to justice while protecting personal data, and addressing issues with the current de-identification process being insufficient and legal definitions being vague.

Method: Constructing a legal dataset with annotated judgments, introducing a systematic categorization of PII, and developing an end-to-end DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID effectively addresses the challenges in de-identifying court judgments at scale while complying with legal requirements.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型(LLMs)在通用领域自然语言处理任务上取得了很大进展，但在关键领域（如临床试验招募）的应用仍然有限。临床试验设计和患者数据表示的特点使得试验-患者匹配任务可以从LLMs的知识聚合和推理能力中受益。然而，现有基于LLM的方法依赖于专有模型和弱评估基准。

Method: 文献综述和批判性分析

Result: 提供了对临床试验招募中试验-患者匹配任务的全面分析，包括对现有基准、方法和评估框架的批判性审查，以及在临床研究中采用LLM技术的挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: 综述了临床试验招募中的试验-患者匹配任务，并对新兴的基于LLM的方法进行了情境化分析。批判性地检查了现有的基准、方法和评估框架，以及在临床研究中采用LLM技术的挑战和令人兴奋的未来方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method using supervised contrastive learning to enhance the language identification performance for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve class imbalance and bias issues in low-resource languages.

Method: A novel supervised contrastive learning approach is used to learn domain-invariant representations.

Result: An improvement of 3.2% in LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

*Camila Zurdo Tagliabue,Heloisa Oss Boll,Aykut Erdem,Erkut Erdem,Iacer Calixto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeVisE is a new way to test how well large language models understand clinical information by changing small details like age or vital signs in patient notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ways of checking if large language models can help doctors make decisions don't tell us if the model really understands medicine or just recognizes patterns. DeVisE aims to fix this by creating tests that look at how sensitive these models are to specific changes in patient data.

Method: Researchers created a dataset of patient discharge summaries from a big hospital database. They made two versions of each summary: one with real data and another where they changed only one thing like the patient's age or blood pressure. Then they tested five different types of language models to see how they reacted to these changes.

Result: Models showed different behaviors depending on whether they were trained specifically for medicine or not. General models responded more strongly to changes but were less stable overall compared to those trained for medical tasks which were steadier but less reactive to important shifts.

Conclusion: This study shows that behavioral testing helps uncover how clinical language models think and decide. It suggests we need fairer evaluations and better designs for medical AI to ensure safety and transparency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

TL;DR: SANSKRITI is a new benchmark for evaluating large language models' understanding of India's cultural diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well language models can understand local socio-cultural contexts, particularly in India.

Method: Developed a benchmark named SANSKRITI with 21,853 question-answer pairs covering 16 aspects of Indian culture across all regions.

Result: Found significant gaps in the cultural understanding of various types of language models, especially in region-specific contexts.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI provides a robust tool for enhancing cultural understanding in language models.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists in Indian languages for comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization.

Method: The study creates COSMMIC, which includes article-image pairs and reader comments with ground-truth summaries. It explores four configurations for enhancing summaries.

Result: COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments. The study evaluates different component combinations using advanced language models.

Conclusion: COSMMIC fills a gap in Indian language resources for NLP research and fosters inclusivity by integrating text, images, and user feedback.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a method that uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning to improve the lexical alignment of large language models in low-resource languages, specifically Swahili.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor performance of large language models in low-resource languages due to data scarcity and underrepresentation during pre-training, particularly focusing on improving cross-lingual lexical alignment for tasks like translation.

Method: TLI involves fine-tuning the model by targeting embeddings from an optimal early layer using LoRA and a contrastive learning objective.

Result: TLI improved the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs and also showed generalization to unseen control word pairs.

Conclusion: TLI offers a parameter-efficient way to enhance the model's ability to preserve and propagate cross-lingual knowledge in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations in MLLMs which leads to systematic localization errors affecting reliability.

Method: Introduces a fine-grained evaluation framework categorizing model predictions into four types and proposes Peak Sharpness Score (PSS) as a metric to evaluate model uncertainty.

Result: The proposed methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the new evaluation framework and methods in improving the reliability of MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2提供了一个全面的解决方案，用于构建高效的通用LLM多代理系统，在复杂推理场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

Motivation: To determine whether the success of LLMs on reasoning tasks comes from true reasoning or just statistical recall of the training set.

Method: Introduces a framework called RE-IMAGINE, which uses the ladder of causation to create problem variations that cannot be solved by memorization alone.

Result: The framework was used to evaluate several families of LLMs on four widely-used benchmarks, revealing a reliance on statistical recall.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that further research is needed to improve the reasoning skills of LLMs.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method called CINGS is proposed to improve the grounded generation of large language models by using post-training supervision with relevant context prepended to the response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation in large language models.

Method: CINGS trains the model with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context.

Result: Models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: The enhanced grounding in CINGS is achieved without degradation in general downstream performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

*Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi,Xiaodan Zhu,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce SPARE, a new method for efficient, high-quality automated process annotation to improve multi-step reasoning in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficient, high-quality automated process annotation for advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE)

Result: Improves reasoning performance, competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets, 2.6 times greater efficiency than tree search-based automatic annotation.

Conclusion: SPARE improves reasoning performance in both fine-tuning models and training reward models. It also achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets with higher efficiency.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [33] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi) was proposed, which achieved better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in identifying hyperbole and metaphor due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, and to consider the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices.

Method: Proposed an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi), including emotion analysis module, emotion-based domain mapping module, and bidirectional dynamic interaction module.

Result: Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets, with a significant increase in F1 score for hyperbole and metaphor detection.

Conclusion: The proposed EmoBi framework has proven to be effective and potential for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

*Shang Hong Sim,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,Hai Leong Chieu,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Navonil Majumder,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates using reinforcement learning and internal reasoning to improve grounding in large language models. It introduces the GRPO method to train models with verifiable outcome-based rewards, showing significant improvement over instruction-only models in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving grounding in large language models to generate more trustworthy and accurate responses.

Method: Using the GRPO method to train models with verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality.

Result: Reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses.

Conclusion: The study highlights the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven reinforcement learning for building more verifiable and reliable large language models.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

### [35] [RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15545)
*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Local-global attention models face a tradeoff between performance and efficiency based on window size. This paper introduces RATTENTION, which enhances local attention by incorporating a linear attention mechanism to consider out-of-window tokens, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of local attention that ignores out-of-window tokens to improve performance and efficiency.

Method: Introducing RATTENTION, a variant of local attention combined with a specialized linear attention mechanism.

Result: RATTENTION achieves better performance and efficiency tradeoffs, matching full-attention model performance with a smaller window size (512), and improves long-context performance without sacrificing training efficiency.

Conclusion: RATTENTION provides a more efficient local-global attention model that can match full attention performance with smaller window sizes and enhance long-context capabilities.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*John X. Morris,Junjie Oscar Yin,Woojeong Kim,Vitaly Shmatikov,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to recover training data from model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of closed training data in modern language models with open weights.

Method: A gradient-based approach that selects matching data from a large public text corpus.

Result: The method effectively recovers useful data, improving performance on classification tasks and reducing perplexity.

Conclusion: The proposed method can locate a small subset of public Web documents to train a model close to the original model's performance.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Predictive Generation (PredGen), a framework that reduces latency in real-time voice chat applications using Large Language Models by generating responses speculatively during user speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve user experience in real-time voice chat applications by reducing the noticeable latency caused by Large Language Models when deployed on limited hardware.

Method: Proposes Predictive Generation (PredGen) which generates candidate responses while users are speaking, allowing early TTS processing.

Result: Simulations on Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show a 2x reduction in latency with minimal additional computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces latency in real-time voice chat applications without significant extra computation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

TL;DR: A comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models using a new metric called Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI). Significant variations in gender inclusivity were found across 22 LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies mainly focused on binary gender distinctions, but there is a need to evaluate diverse gender inclusivity in LLMs.

Method: Introduced GIFI, which evaluates gender inclusivity at different levels including probing gender pronouns and testing generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions.

Result: Significant differences in gender inclusivity were discovered among 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities.

Conclusion: Stressed the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity and provided a benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces DiscoSG, a new task for discourse-level text scene graph parsing, along with a refined model DiscoSG-Refiner that improves efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods miss phenomena like cross-sentence coreference when generating discourse-level visual descriptions.

Method: Fine-tunes large PLMs on DiscoSG-DS and proposes DiscoSG-Refiner which uses two small PLMs to iteratively refine graphs.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner improves SPICE score by 30% over the best baseline and is 86 times faster than GPT-4.

Conclusion: Introduces DiscoSG and DiscoSG-DS, proposes DiscoSG-Refiner, improves SPICE scores, enhances downstream VLM tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents WikiMixQA, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts from Wikipedia pages. It shows that proprietary models perform better than open-source ones when given direct context but struggle with retrieving information from long documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in automatic document understanding, especially for complex layouts, tables, and charts.

Method: Introducing WikiMixQA with 1,000 MCQs based on 4,000 Wikipedia pages across seven topics, emphasizing complex reasoning across multiple modalities.

Result: Proprietary models like GPT-4-o achieve around 70% accuracy with direct context and over 50% in retrieval tasks, while open-source models max out at 27%.

Conclusion: The study highlights the difficulties of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establishes WikiMixQA as an important benchmark for future DU research.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the ability of current generative models to produce multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. It evaluates the generated MCQs' quality and reliability through expert review and psychometric analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual creation of MCQs with varying difficulty levels is time-consuming and costly. Generative AI offers a way to automate this process, but the quality and reliability of generated MCQs, especially in non-English languages, need more attention.

Method: Generative models were used to produce MCQs aligned with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and different difficulty levels for Portuguese reading comprehension. The MCQs were evaluated via expert review and psychometric properties analysis based on student responses.

Result: Current models can generate MCQs of similar quality to human-authored ones, but there are issues with semantic clarity and answerability. Challenges persist in creating engaging and high-quality distractors.

Conclusion: Automated MCQ generation using generative models shows promise but requires further refinement to ensure semantic clarity, answerability, and high-quality distractor creation, especially for real-world application.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

### [43] [The Compositional Architecture of Regret in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15617)
*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the concept of 'regret' in large language models, introducing methods to study it including creating a regret dataset, metrics for identifying optimal regret representation layers, and categorizing neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the regret mechanism in large language models is important for improving model reliability and understanding cognitive coding in neural networks.

Method: The authors propose a workflow for constructing a regret dataset, a Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric for identifying optimal regret representation layers, and a Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric for identifying regret neurons and analyzing activation patterns.

Result: Experiments using the S-CDI metric identified the optimal regret representation layer, which improved performance in probe classification experiments. An M-shaped decoupling pattern was found across model layers, and neurons were categorized into three functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the regret mechanism in large language models and offers new tools for analyzing neural network cognition.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

TL;DR: This paper explores cross-cultural differences in interpreting intensifiers 'quite' and 'very' between British and American English speakers through three experiments. A computational cognitive model was developed to explain these differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication arise from literal meanings or pragmatic factors.

Method: Developing a computational cognitive model where listeners consider speakers' balancing of informativity, politeness, and utterance cost.

Result: Cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation result from both different literal meanings and different emphasis on utterance cost.

Conclusion: Interpretation differences in cross-cultural communication come from an interaction between literal meanings and pragmatic factors, challenging accounts based solely on semantics or politeness norms.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing Ordered CommonGen to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow instructions and generalize compositions, finding they mostly understand instructions but struggle with diversity and specific order biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue where generative large language models must generate sentences adhering to a specified concept order in instruction-following capabilities.

Method: Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs by measuring ordered coverage.

Result: While LLMs generally understand instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. The most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions but have biases towards specific concept order patterns, leading to low-diversity outputs. Their instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities need improvement.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts using the ROST corpus.

Method: Systematically evaluating six machine learning techniques including SVM, LR, k-NN, DT, RF, and ANN with character n-gram features for classification.

Result: The ANN model achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen runs when using 5-gram features.

Conclusion: Lightweight, interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves large language models' reasoning reliability by training on cohorts of similar questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with consistent and robust reasoning.

Method: Define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, retrieval bonus, and rejection penalty, optimizing which guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns.

Result: Experiments on ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA show CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents.

Method: Probing and agentic evaluations were used to demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage.

Result: Test-time compute approaches increase the privacy attack surface, revealing a core tension between reasoning improving utility and enlarging the privacy attack surface.

Conclusion: Reasoning traces of large models can contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leaked into outputs.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

### [49] [Gender-Neutral Machine Translation Strategies in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15676)
*Hillary Dawkins,Isar Nejadgholi,Chi-kiu Lo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates 21 MT systems' sensitivity to gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity across three translation directions. It categorizes and discusses practical gender-neutral strategies and examines the influence of binary gender stereotypes on gender-neutral translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure gender inclusivity in machine translation by preserving gender ambiguity in the source and avoiding misgendering and representational harms.

Method: Assessing the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to gender neutrality in three translation directions with varying difficulty, categorizing observed gender-neutral strategies, and examining the impact of binary gender stereotypes on gender-neutral translation.

Result: Most MT systems fail to provide gender-neutral translations in response to gender ambiguity. A few systems use specific strategies to switch to gender-neutral translation based on the target language.

Conclusion: There is a significant lack of gender-neutral translations in current MT systems, but some promising strategies exist for future improvement.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

*Byung-Kwan Lee,Ryo Hachiuma,Yong Man Ro,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Distill large VLMs into smaller ones effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploy large VLMs on resource-constrained devices is challenging.

Method: Introduce GenRecal, a recalibrator aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs.

Result: Significantly improve baseline performances on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal outperforms large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

*Yuhui Shi,Yehan Yang,Qiang Sheng,Hao Mi,Beizhe Hu,Chaoxi Xu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes PhantomHunter, a detector that identifies text generated by unseen privately-tuned large language models, showing superior performance across multiple families with F1 scores over 96%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting text from privately tuned LLMs to combat misinformation and academic misconduct.

Method: Introduces a family-aware learning framework that focuses on shared traits rather than individual characteristics.

Result: PhantomHunter outperforms seven baselines and three industrial services on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families with high F1 scores.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter is effective in detecting text from unseen privately-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

### [52] [Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15041)
*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting economic narratives from texts, comparing GPT-4o outputs with expert-produced narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in economic narratives, but current pipelines using advanced NLP techniques lack deep semantic understanding needed for this specific task.

Method: Analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times articles about inflation, applying a strict narrative definition, and comparing GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives.

Result: GPT-4o can extract valid economic narratives in a structured format but doesn't match expert-level performance especially with complex documents.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in economic research, but more guidance and further development are needed for their application in economics and social sciences.

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

### [53] [Detecting Narrative Shifts through Persistent Structures: A Topological Analysis of Media Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14836)
*Mark M. Bailey,Mark I. Heiligman*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study uses persistent homology to analyze how major events shape media narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify structural changes in media narratives due to global events.

Method: Constructing daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases and transforming them into persistence diagrams via a Vietoris-Rips filtration.

Result: Major geopolitical and social events align with spikes in H0 and H1, indicating narrative reorganization.

Conclusion: Persistent homology provides an unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper presents an OCR-based speech synthesis system developed using LabVIEW, which helps visually impaired individuals access books through sound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide blind and visually impaired individuals with better access to books through a more effective communication mode than text.

Method: An OCR-based speech synthesis system was developed using LabVIEW.

Result: The developed system is accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly.

Conclusion: The proposed system can significantly improve the accessibility of books for visually impaired individuals.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,
reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition
(OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented
using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

*Anuradha Chopra,Abhinaba Roy,Dorien Herremans*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A new model named SonicVerse is proposed which generates detailed captions for music pieces by integrating multiple music feature detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create richer music database and promote research in music AI by generating detailed and accurate music captions.

Method: SonicVerse model integrates music caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks, uses a projection-based architecture to transform audio input into language tokens, and enhances captioning input with outputs from auxiliary heads. For longer music pieces, a large-language model chains the outputs.

Result: The model produces rich and descriptive captions for short music fragments and detailed time-informed descriptions for longer pieces. The quality and detail of generated captions are improved by incorporating music features.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating music feature detection with caption generation in improving the detail and accuracy of music captions.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Propose a novel agentic plan caching approach to reduce costs for LLM-based agentic applications by extracting and reusing plan templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM caching techniques are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts.

Method: Extract, store, adapt, and reuse structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks.

Result: Evaluation shows that the system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Agentic plan caching offers a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

TL;DR: This paper presents HAC, a unified neural speech codec with a factorized bottleneck across acoustic, phonetic, and lexical levels. It uses knowledge distillation from HuBERT and LaBSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified discrete speech representation that bridges acoustic detail and lexical meaning for speech generation and understanding tasks.

Method: Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC) with two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.

Result: Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets, preserving naturalness and providing interpretable linguistic information.

Conclusion: HAC shows potential as a unified discrete speech representation, improving disentanglement and reconstruction quality over single-level baselines.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current limitation of AI agents is that they either focus on digital information or physical interaction, rarely both. This separation restricts their ability to handle tasks requiring combined physical and digital intelligence.

Method: Create Embodied Web Agents task environments that combine realistic 3D environments with functional web interfaces.

Result: Benchmark includes diverse tasks like cooking, navigation, shopping etc., requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms. Significant performance gaps found between state-of-the-art AI systems and humans.

Conclusion: Embodied Web Agents present challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to evaluate the alignment between large language model simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing how well large language models replicate human behavior is important as they become more involved in social science research.

Method: A quantitative framework using hypothesis testing is used to determine if a language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors.

Result: The popular language model tested was found to be unsuitable for simulating certain sub-populations for contentious questions.

Conclusion: This highlights the need for new practices when using large language models in social science studies.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SemIRNet, a model for multimodal irony detection that uses ConceptNet for common-sense reasoning, two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules, and contrastive learning loss function to improve accuracy and F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in accurately identifying graphical implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks.

Method: Introducing ConceptNet knowledge base, designing two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules, and introducing contrastive learning loss function.

Result: Improved accuracy and F1 value by 1.64% and 2.88% respectively to 88.87% and 86.33%.

Conclusion: Knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection play an important role in improving the model performance.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 视频-SALMONN 2 是一个用于增强视频（配音频）字幕的先进视听大语言模型，通过定向偏好优化和新提出的多轮定向偏好优化方法显著提升了字幕准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频描述生成方法在准确性和完整性上存在不足，需要一种更高效的方法来提升视频理解能力。

Method: 使用低秩适应设计的视听大语言模型，并采用定向偏好优化及多轮定向偏好优化方法。

Result: 实验表明，视频-SALMONN 2 在字幕准确性方面提高了28%，并且在小参数规模下超越了其他领先模型。

Conclusion: 视频-SALMONN 2 在视频字幕任务上表现出色，同时在相似大小的模型中保持了竞争力。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

TL;DR: ETS improves EEG-To-Text decoding and sentiment classification by integrating EEG and eye-tracking data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with noise and variability in open-vocabulary scenarios.

Method: ETS integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data.

Result: ETS achieves better BLEU, Rouge scores, and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification.

Conclusion: ETS demonstrates superior performance in both open-vocabulary text generation and sentiment classification.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Develop a new method called 'Assembly-of-Experts' (AoE) to create child models of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. The child model 'DeepSeek R1T "Chimera"' combines two parent models and shows similar intelligence with faster response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the computational cost of training large language models.

Method: Interpolate model weight tensors individually to create child models.

Result: Nearly every generated model is functional and capable. The 'Chimera' model achieves similar intelligence as its parent models but with faster response.

Conclusion: The AoE method provides a way to efficiently create capable child models from existing parent models.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Guru, a large RL reasoning dataset covering six domains. It revisits RL findings for LLM reasoning and demonstrates that RL benefits vary across domains. Two models, Guru-7B and Guru-32B, achieve state-of-the-art performance on an evaluation suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains and understand the broader applicability of RL to general reasoning.

Method: Curating a RL reasoning corpus called Guru with 92K verifiable examples across six domains, and using it to revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning.

Result: Observation of significant variation in RL benefits across domains. Domains frequently seen during pretraining easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while others require in-domain training. Two models, Guru-7B and Guru-32B, achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how RL can facilitate genuine skill acquisition in different reasoning domains and releases data, models, and code to promote general-purpose reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

### [66] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimizing large language models' pretraining is costly. μP parametrizes model weights and learning rates to make hyperparameters transferable across model widths. However, empirical studies show mixed results when applying μP to LLMs. The paper provides a theoretical analysis showing that increasing vocabulary size changes training dynamics, transitioning from μP regime to Large Vocab (LV) regime with different optimal scaling rules. The authors suggest an embedding learning rate scaling rule that aligns with empirical findings and demonstrate its benefits through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make pretraining large language models more efficient by addressing limitations in current parametrization methods like μP, particularly regarding the impact of vocabulary size.

Method: Theoretical analysis of how increasing vocabulary size affects training dynamics and introduces a new Large Vocab (LV) regime with distinct optimal scaling rules compared to μP.

Result: The optimal embedding learning rate to hidden learning rate ratio scales as Θ(√width) in the LV regime, which is close to empirical observations and differs from μP's Θ(width) prediction.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of considering vocabulary size in training dynamics and offers a revised scaling rule that improves upon μP for large language model pretraining.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

*Yingcong Li,Xiangyu Chang,Muti Kara,Xiaofeng Liu,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Samet Oymak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how transformers can effectively use unlabeled data in in-context learning for semi-supervised tabular learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why in-context learning works well even when some labels are missing or incorrect.

Method: Examining binary Gaussian mixture model with missing labels and studying the loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models and multilayer/looped transformers.

Result: One-layer linear attention models cannot use unlabeled data while multilayer/looped transformers can construct estimators leveraging unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models can enhance their semi-supervision capabilities.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种新的框架，用于提供更细致的神经网络特征描述，克服了现有方法在鲁棒性和单义性假设上的限制。应用到语言模型上，PRISM通过描述分数和多义性分数证明了其在提高描述准确性方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征描述方法存在鲁棒性差及对神经元单义性假设的问题，限制了对模型行为全面理解的能力。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，能捕捉神经网络特征的复杂性，并为多义性和单义性特征提供更细致的描述。

Result: PRISM在语言模型上的应用显示出了比现有方法更高的描述准确性和忠实度，特别是在多义性存在的场景下。

Conclusion: PRISM克服了现有方法的局限性，提供了更准确和忠实的特征描述，增强了对神经网络内部行为的理解。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

TL;DR: This paper presents LoX, a novel training-free method that enhances the safety robustness of aligned large language models by extrapolating the safety subspace, reducing vulnerability to fine-tuning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of aligned LLMs to fine-tuning attacks, even when the additional training data seems harmless.

Method: A novel training-free method named Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX) is proposed.

Result: LoX achieves significant reductions in attack success rates (ASR) against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks, improving robustness while maintaining model adaptability.

Conclusion: LoX shows its effectiveness in enhancing the safety robustness of aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

TL;DR: AutoRule是一种全自动方法，可以从偏好反馈中提取规则并制定成基于规则的奖励，从而提高强化学习从人类反馈中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法往往依赖于手动规则工程，而AutoRule提供了一种全自动的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: AutoRule提取操作分为三个阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从这些解释的推理链中识别候选规则，并将其综合成统一的规则集。利用最终确定的规则集，我们使用语言模型验证器计算每个输出满足规则的比例，以此指标作为辅助奖励与学习的奖励模型一起用于策略优化。

Result: 在AlpacaEval2.0上，使用AutoRule训练Llama-3-8B模型相对改进了28.6%的长度控制下的胜率，在一个保留的MT-Bench子集上的第二轮性能相对提高了6.1%，并且在两个episode中运行时，AutoRule表现出比学习的奖励模型更少的奖励黑客行为。

Conclusion: 使用AutoRule从偏好反馈中提取规则并制定成基于规则的奖励，可以相对改进长度控制下的胜率和第二轮性能。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates dense latents in sparse autoencoders (SAEs), showing that they are meaningful rather than artifacts of the training procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether dense latents in SAEs are undesirable artifacts or meaningful representations.

Method: Systematically analyzing the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents.

Result: Dense latents form antipodal pairs, tied to various functions like position tracking and entropy regulation, and evolve across layers.

Conclusion: Dense latents have functional roles in language model computation and should not be ignored.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.
