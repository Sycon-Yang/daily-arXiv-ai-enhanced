### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: We propose a self-supervised approach called GEM that enables large decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings without affecting their original text generation and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many applications still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings, which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of the query between the embedding model and LLMs.

Method: Inserting new special token(s) into a text body and generating summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention mask.

Result: The results show that our proposed method significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact on MMLU.

Conclusion: Our proposed method significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact on MMLU.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Build an ASR system robust to various accents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create an ASR system serving people with diverse accents globally.

Method: Analyze effects of speaker number, audio duration, and accent diversity on ASR robustness.

Result: More speakers are more beneficial than longer contributions per speaker for fixed training hours; more speakers enable performance gains from scaling hours.

Conclusion: Prioritize increasing speaker count for new languages in ASR training data.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to make sentence embeddings more interpretable by decomposing them into meaningful components using dictionary learning on token-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal structure of sentence embeddings better and make them more transparent and controllable.

Method: Using dictionary learning on token-level representations to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components.

Result: The method reveals that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the interpretability of sentence embeddings, bridging token-level and sentence-level analyses.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes HTC-CLIP, a new method for Hierarchical Text Classification that combines two approaches using contrastive learning, improving performance by up to 2.37% on Macro F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hierarchical text classification performance by combining separate label hierarchy encoding with text encoder guided label hierarchy structure.

Method: Proposes HTC-CLIP, which learns hierarchy-aware text representation and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive learning. Combines two sets of class probability distributions during training and inference.

Result: Tests on two public datasets showed an improvement of 0.99-2.37% in Macro F1 score over existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed HTC-CLIP model effectively combines two previous approaches into one architecture, achieving better performance in hierarchical text classification.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluate 55 LLMs on Maltese using a new benchmark covering 11 tasks. Smaller fine-tuned models perform better than larger ones. Prior exposure to Maltese is crucial. Fine-tuning has better performance and lower inference costs than prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of large language models on low-resource languages like Maltese.

Method: Evaluate 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 tasks including both discriminative and generative tasks.

Result: Many models perform poorly, especially on generative tasks. Smaller fine-tuned models perform better. Prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning is the most important factor affecting performance. Fine-tuning has better performance and lower inference costs than prompting.

Conclusion: Need for more inclusive language technologies. Researchers working with low-resource languages should consider traditional language modeling approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model architecture that improves intent detection accuracy across domains with few labeled samples, showing significant improvement over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer care is crucial in e-commerce shopping experience, but model performance depends on enough annotated domain-specific data. Building an intent classifier that generalizes across domains with limited annotations is valuable.

Method: Propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture that extends domain-specific models to other domains with few labeled samples. Use supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and multilingual knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple domains.

Result: Experiments on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The proposed model can effectively improve the accuracy of intent detection across different domains with limited annotations.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Conclusion: MedAgentGYM provides a comprehensive benchmark and accessible training resources for developing LLM-based coding assistants for biomedical research and practice.

Abstract: We introduce MedAgentGYM, the first publicly available training environment
designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth
annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive
benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between
commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging
MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，人类规模的语言模型在形式上敏感但对罕见语言结构的意义泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究罕见语言结构的普遍化能力及其在形式和意义方面的知识广度。

Method: 测试人类规模的变压器语言模型对英语LET-ALONE构造的形式和意义的知识。构建一个定制的综合基准来针对该构造的句法和语义属性。

Result: 人类规模的语言模型对形式敏感，但在关于LET-ALONE意义的正确泛化上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义方面的样本效率存在不对称性，这在人类语言学习者中不存在。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods based on large language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.

Method: ZOES operates via a principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.

Result: ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains.

Conclusion: Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains, showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of two watermarking methods on large language models' truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness. It identifies two degradation patterns and proposes a method called Alignment Resampling to recover alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the effects of watermarking on core alignment properties of large language models.

Method: Systematic analysis of Gumbel and KGW watermarking approaches on four aligned LLMs, proposing Alignment Resampling method.

Result: Identifies guard attenuation and guard amplification degradation patterns, demonstrates that AR restores baseline alignment while maintaining detectability.

Conclusion: Highlights the balance needed between watermark strength and model alignment, offering a practical inference-time solution for deploying watermarked LLMs.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出PUGC框架，利用用户生成内容中的隐式偏好生成偏好数据，提升大语言模型生成响应的质量，并在多个方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好学习方法依赖于人工或高级大型语言模型（LLMs）整理的数据，这些数据成本高昂且难以扩展。因此，作者提出了一种新框架来解决这些问题。

Method: PUGC框架利用用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐式人类偏好来生成偏好数据。它将UGC转化为用户查询，并从策略模型生成响应。然后使用UGC作为参考文本对响应进行评分，从而与这些隐式偏好对齐。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型在Alpaca Eval 2上比传统方法提高了9.37％的性能，并且在Mistral-7B-Instruct上达到了35.93％的最新长度控制胜率。此外，还显示出奖励质量、特定领域对齐效果、对UGC质量的鲁棒性以及思维理论能力方面的收益。

Conclusion: 提出的PUGC框架通过利用用户生成内容中的隐式人类偏好，能够有效提高大语言模型的响应质量，并实现可扩展的特定领域对齐。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SQLens框架，用于检测和修正LLM生成SQL中的语义错误，显著提高了错误检测率和执行准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在文本到SQL任务上取得了有希望的结果，但它们经常产生语义不正确但语法有效的查询，并且对它们的可靠性缺乏洞察力。

Method: SQLens 是一个端到端框架，用于检测和纠正LLM生成的SQL中的语义错误。它结合数据库和LLM的错误信号来识别SQL子句中的潜在语义错误，并利用这些信号指导查询修正。

Result: SQLens 在两个公共基准测试中表现出了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: SQLens 在错误检测方面比最好的基于LLM的自评估方法高出25.78%的F1值，并通过高达20%的执行准确性改进了开箱即用的文本到SQL系统。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method integrating small and large language models via adaptive weighting improves evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large and small language models in handling ambiguous scenarios and misleading inputs respectively.

Method: Introducing SLIDE, which combines SLMs and LLMs through adaptive weighting, and further proposing DRE to enhance integration.

Result: Experiments show DRE outperforms existing methods and aligns better with human judgment across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining small and large models can create more reliable evaluation tools for open-ended tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

### [15] [Please Translate Again: Two Simple Experiments on Whether Human-Like Reasoning Helps Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04521)
*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities for many tasks, including translation, through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This paper examines whether explicitly decomposing the translation process improves performance. It finds no clear evidence that it does, and shows that simply asking LLMs to 'translate again' can yield better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if explicitly decomposing the translation process with LLMs improves performance.

Method: Empirical evaluation of different prompting strategies for LLM-based translation.

Result: No clear evidence that explicitly decomposing translation improves performance; 'translate again' prompt yields better results.

Conclusion: The role of reasoning in translation needs further exploration in future work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

Motivation: 话语颗粒是塑造文本意义的重要元素，尽管这些词功能多样，但它们会产生微妙且常常截然不同的语义/话语效果。

Method: 使用由专家语言学家精心创建和标注的数据来研究LLMs区分英语'just'细粒度语义的能力。

Result: LLMs在区分较大类别上表现出了部分能力，但在捕捉更细微的差别方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs在区分较大类别上表现出一定能力，但它们难以完全捕捉更微妙的差异，这揭示了它们在理解话语颗粒方面存在差距。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Motivation: To evaluate the performance of existing models on questions with no reasonable answer.

Method: Present a benchmark for such testing and a method to modify existing datasets.

*Senyu Li,Jiayi Wang,Felermino D. M. A. Ali,Colin Cherry,Daniel Deutsch,Eleftheria Briakou,Rui Sousa-Silva,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pontus Stenetorp,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Developed SSA-MTE, a large-scale MTE dataset for 13 African language pairs, and improved metrics SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE. Benchmarked prompting-based approaches with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating MT quality for under-resourced African languages is challenging due to limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.

Method: Introduced SSA-MTE dataset, developed SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE metrics, and benchmarked prompting-based approaches with LLMs.

Result: SSA-COMET models outperformed AfriCOMET and were competitive with the strongest LLM on low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Released all resources under open licenses to support future research.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

### [19] [Demonstrations of Integrity Attacks in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04572)
*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigating integrity attacks on multi-agent systems using large language models reveals vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious agents to mislead system evaluations and manipulate collaborative agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how malicious agents can exploit multi-agent systems through subtle prompt manipulation, causing biases in the system's operations and evaluations.

Method: The research examines four types of integrity attacks on multi-agent systems using strategically crafted prompts. These include Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, and Free-Rider attacks.

Result: Results show that these attacks can introduce systematic biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, allowing malicious agents to mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents. Advanced LLM-based monitors like GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini cannot effectively detect these attacks.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems when exposed to integrity attacks by malicious agents using large language models. It emphasizes the necessity for secure architectures with effective content validation and monitoring systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

TL;DR: 研究显示，对于金融情感分析，无需推理的GPT-4o表现最佳，挑战了更多推理会带来更好决策的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性，特别是基于推理的模型是否能提高性能。

Method: 研究了包括基于推理和非基于推理的大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性。比较了三种专有LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）在不同提示范式下的表现，并将其与两个经过金融情感分析微调的小型模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone）进行了基准测试。

Result: 没有链式思维(CoT)提示的GPT-4o是准确率最高且与人类标签最一致的模型组合。推理可能会引入过度思考，导致次优预测。

Conclusion: 我们发现，对于金融情感分类任务，快速、直观的‘系统1’式思考比‘系统2’式的缓慢、审慎的推理更符合人类判断。结果挑战了更多推理总是导致更好的大型语言模型决策的默认假设，特别是在高风险的金融应用中。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [21] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating the reliability of large language models (LLMs) as logic translators in handling lexical diversification. It also introduces MenTaL, a method that enhances LLMs' performance on lexically diversified text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unreliability of LLMs as logic translators due to their struggle with lexical diversification, which is a common linguistic phenomenon. Existing benchmarks lack lexical diversity, making it difficult to assess this capability.

Method: The authors propose SCALe, which transforms original datasets into lexically diversified yet logically equivalent versions. They also introduce MenTaL, a method that guides LLMs to construct a table unifying diverse expressions before translation.

Result: Experiments using SCALe show that current LLMs have deficiencies in translating lexically diversified text. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning improves the performance of LLM translators on such text.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of addressing the issue of lexical diversification in LLMs and proposes SCALe and MenTaL as solutions.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a gradient matching approach for selecting demonstrations in many-shot ICL that improves performance compared to random selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for many-shot ICL rely on random selection which is not effective, thus the need for a better selection method.

Method: Gradient matching approach that aligns fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set and selected examples.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms random selection on larger LLMs in 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a gradient matching approach for selecting demonstrations in many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) that outperforms random selection across various datasets.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method called SUCEA is proposed to rephrase adversarial claims for easier fact-checking. The framework consists of three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction. Experiments show that SUCEA outperforms four strong baselines in retrieval and entailment label accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle adversarial claims that are intentionally designed to challenge fact-checking systems.

Method: Proposing a training-free method called SUCEA that decomposes the task into three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction.

Result: Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free method called SUCEA can effectively rephrase adversarial claims, making it easier to locate supporting evidence and improving fact-checking performance.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MuSciClaims, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal claim verification abilities using information-rich figures from scientific literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific QA and multimodal reasoning tasks do not have readily usable benchmarks for testing claim verification abilities.

Method: Automatically extracting supported claims from scientific articles and manually perturbing them to produce contradicted claims. Introducing diagnostic tasks to understand model failures.

Result: Most vision-language models perform poorly on MuSciClaims, with the best achieving 0.77 F1. Models are biased towards judging claims as supported and struggle with localizing evidence, aggregating information, and understanding figure components.

Conclusion: MuSciClaims provides a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal claim verification abilities, highlighting areas where current models need improvement.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance pseudo-label refinement and data augmentation in semi-supervised learning.

Method: Uses LLMs to refine pseudo labels and a data filtering strategy to optimize knowledge transfer efficiency.

Result: Achieves significant WER reduction on Wenet Speech test set and high BLEU scores on Callhome and Fisher test sets.

Conclusion: LESS demonstrates adaptability across multiple languages, tasks, and domains.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method named Safe is proposed to verify the reasoning steps of large language models using formal mathematical language Lean 4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide interpretable and verifiable evidence for identifying hallucinations in chain-of-thought prompting which are hard to detect.

Method: Retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework Safe is used to articulate mathematical claims and provide formal proofs in Lean 4 at each reasoning step.

Result: Significant performance improvement is demonstrated across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence.

Conclusion: This is the first attempt to use formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Motivation: Existing datasets for scientific NLI are limited to CS domains, ignoring non-CS domains. This paper aims to address this gap by creating a diverse benchmark.

Method: Introduces MISMATCHED benchmark covering PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH domains with 2,700 annotated sentence pairs. Establishes baselines using SLMs and LLMs.

Result: Best baseline achieved a Macro F1 score of 78.17%, indicating significant potential for future improvements.

Conclusion: MISMATCHED provides a valuable resource for evaluating scientific NLI models, especially in non-CS domains. Incorporating implicit scientific NLI relations during training enhances model performance.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

This paper reviews TTS methods and finds reasoning-optimized models generate less diverse outputs, limiting TTS effectiveness. To solve this, ADAPT is proposed - a lightweight method that uses prefix tuning with a diversity-focused data strategy. On math reasoning tasks, ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy using 8x less compute than strong baselines.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the effectiveness of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) for enhancing reasoning performance in large language models by addressing the issue of less diverse outputs from reasoning-optimized models.

Method: This paper categorizes TTS methods into sampling-based, search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. It proposes ADAPT, a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a diversity-focused data strategy.

Result: Experiments show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong baselines on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Generative diversity plays an important role in maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a

show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in

*Likun Cao,Rui Pan,James Evans*

TL;DR: This study explores how subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities can be modeled using machine learning approaches based on innovators' experiences. It finds that subjective perspective diversity predicts creative achievement, while background diversity does not.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities in shaping creative achievements.

Method: Using machine learning approaches to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities based on their prior experiences.

Result: Subjective perspective diversity predicts creative achievement, while background diversity does not.

Conclusion: Successful collaborators leverage common language to integrate diverse experiences and create innovative ideas.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentence-level representations for better performance in sentence semantic tasks.

Method: Extract word embeddings from pre-trained Sentence Transformer, improve them with sentence-level PCA, followed by knowledge distillation or contrastive learning.

Result: The proposed model outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks and rivals a basic Sentence Transformer model on some datasets.

Conclusion: Successfully removes irrelevant word embedding components and adjusts vector norms based on word influence on sentence semantics.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

*Zhiyuan Ma,Jiayu Liu,Xianzhen Luo,Zhenya Huang,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Tool-Augmented LLM named Tool-MVR is proposed to improve tool utilization capabilities, which achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two key innovations: Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE). Tool-MVR shows superior performance compared to previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face two major limitations: unreliable tool planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets and weak tool reflection abilities caused by static imitation learning. These limitations hinder AI agents' ability to solve complex problems effectively.

Method: Tool-MVR is created by introducing MAMV to construct ToolBench-V, an improved instruction dataset, and EXPLORE to develop ToolBench-R, a reflection dataset. Both datasets are used to fine-tune open-source LLMs.

Result: Experiments show that Tool-MVR surpasses previous models on StableToolBench and achieves high error correction rates on RefineToolBench.

Conclusion: The proposed Tool-MVR demonstrates excellent performance in tool utilization and reflection capabilities, indicating its potential in enhancing AI agents' problem-solving abilities.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

*Thai-Binh Nguyen,Thi Van Nguyen,Quoc Truong Do,Chi Mai Luong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a practical method to create AVSR datasets from raw video, enhancing data collection efficiency. It establishes a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese, showing competitive performance in clean settings and outperforming traditional ASR in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of scarce datasets for languages other than English in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR), especially under-resourced languages.

Method: Developing an improved technique for automated data collection from raw video to generate AVSR datasets.

Result: The automatically collected dataset allows for a strong baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese, performing well in both clean and noisy conditions compared to traditional ASR.

Conclusion: The approach offers a way to extend AVSR capabilities to more languages, especially those with limited resources.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化消除离群值处理，显著减少了KV缓存内存占用并提升了多个模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型中的KV缓存对高效解码至关重要，但其内存需求随序列长度增长而迅速增加，限制了大规模语言模型的部署。

Method: 提出了一种名为TaDA的方法，包括自适应量化精度和均值中心化，无需单独处理离群值。

Result: 实验表明，TaDA将KV缓存的内存占用减少到原16位基线的27%，同时保持了可比的准确性。

Conclusion: TaDA为语言模型的可扩展高性能推理铺平了道路，可能支持更长上下文长度模型、推理模型以及更长链式思维推理。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

### [34] [Flex-TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Flexible Planning with Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04649)
*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a new benchmark that tests language models' ability to handle dynamic planning scenarios by adding constraints across multiple turns and prioritizing competing ones. Found that single-turn task performance doesn't predict multi-turn adaptability, constraint introduction order matters, and models have trouble with prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks don't reflect real-world planning challenges where requirements change and constraints compete.

Method: Created Flex-TravelPlanner based on TravelPlanner dataset with new evaluation settings.

Result: GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B were analyzed showing poor prediction of multi-turn adaptability, effect of constraint order, and issues with prioritization.

Conclusion: Dynamic, realistic planning scenarios are crucial for evaluating LLMs and suggest ways to improve complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues that current alignment strategies for large language models (LLMs) are insufficient to prevent misuse due to their inability to handle normative conflicts, drawing comparisons with human moral psychology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the value alignment problem for LLMs and highlight the limitations of current alignment strategies.

Method: Analyzing existing alignment methods and comparing them with human capabilities in normative deliberation.

Result: Current alignment strategies for LLMs reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than genuine normative deliberation, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The 'shallow alignment' problem suggests that current approaches are insufficient for ensuring AI safety and regulation.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

TL;DR: Introduces MMRefine, a benchmark for evaluating error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing performance across six error types and multiple scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate MLLMs' error detection and correction abilities beyond just final accuracy.

Method: Designing a MultiModal Refinement benchmark with six distinct scenarios.

Result: Experiments show bottlenecks and factors hindering refinement performance.

Conclusion: Highlights areas for improvement in reasoning enhancement.

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaling laws show that larger models and datasets improve performance. However, the availability of high-quality data limits pre-training. This paper introduces REWIRE, which recycles low-quality data by guided rewriting, improving performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited availability of high-quality data restricts the scaling of pre-training.

Method: REWIRE (REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite), transforms and recycles discarded low-quality data.

Result: Experiments show that mixing high-quality raw texts with rewritten texts improves performance more effectively than increasing web data size or using other synthetic data generation methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts could be a simple and effective way to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的隐晦仇恨言论检测分类策略，并通过两种方法整合到隐晦仇恨言论检测中，实验表明该方法在中英文数据集上有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上仇恨言论威胁社会和谐和个人福祉，现有自动检测方法对显式仇恨言论识别较好但对隐晦形式表现不佳。

Method: 引入新的隐晦仇恨言论检测分类策略，定义六种编码策略，通过两种方法整合到隐晦仇恨言论检测中：直接提示大型语言模型分类句子和使用大型语言模型作为编码器嵌入编码过程。

Result: 实验显示使用编码策略在中英文数据集上提高了隐晦仇恨言论检测效果。

Conclusion: 所提方法在不同语言数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

TL;DR: Introduce STAND, a model-free speculative decoding approach that accelerates reasoning tasks in language models by 60-65% without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between performance and efficiency in reasoning tasks using test-time scaling techniques.

Method: Propose STAND, which uses stochastic drafting and a logit-based N-gram module to improve token acceptance rates.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% across multiple reasoning tasks and outperforms other speculative decoding methods.

Conclusion: STAND is a powerful, model-free solution for accelerating language model reasoning that can be applied to any existing language model.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the challenges posed by the low-resource nature of the Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair in the context of speech translation tasks.

Method: We conducted systematic investigations on different hyperparameters such as learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label smoothing, and batch sizes. We also explored data augmentation techniques like speed perturbation and SpecAugment, and the effect of cross-lingual signals through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech data.

Result: Our results showed that using optimized hyperparameters and applying effective data augmentation techniques can significantly enhance translation quality in low-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: We found that hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation methods have a significant positive impact on the performance of the fine-tuned SeamlessM4T model in low-resource environments.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complement a single model's lack of diversity in generation and biases in evaluation.

Method: Through a adapted elo-ranking based reputation system, multiple LLMs form a 'sparta tribe' to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving as judges for the competition of others.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative and collective competition process.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework called C$^2$EFND that combines large language models and small language models to detect fake news more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news on social media has serious societal impacts. Existing methods have limitations in detecting fake news due to data scarcity and outdated knowledge.

Method: A multi-round collaborative learning framework that leverages both large and small language models, with a lifelong knowledge editing module and a replay-based continue learning method.

Result: Extensive experiments on two datasets show that C$^2$EFND outperforms existing methods in detecting fake news.

Conclusion: The proposed C$^2$EFND framework improves detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous emergent fake news scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

Motivation: Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore mainly focus on similarity rather than meaningful improvements in text revision, which is a challenge in scientific writing.

Method: The paper conducts a manual annotation study, investigates reference-free evaluation metrics, and examines LLM-as-a-judge approaches with and without a gold reference.

Result: LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

TL;DR: This study explores the internal political states of large language models (LLMs) by developing a four-dimensional political learning framework. The research introduces interpretable representation engineering techniques to address concept confounds in analyzing LLMs' political opinions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in disentangling political concepts, detecting semantic meanings, and altering LLMs' political leanings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and uncover their internal political states, as well as to address concept confounds in single-axis political opinion analysis.

Method: Developing a four-dimensional political learning framework, constructing a corresponding dataset, and applying interpretable representation engineering techniques for fine-grained political concept vector learning.

Result: The political concept vectors can disentangle concept confounds, validate semantic meanings, and show good generalization and robustness in out-of-distribution settings. Intervention experiments indicate that these vectors can alter LLMs' political leanings.

Conclusion: This work contributes to a more transparent understanding of LLMs' political concept learning through multi-dimensional analysis and interpretable representation engineering.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Motivation: 现有的多模态语音大语言模型在处理音频信息方面表现出色，但在自然语音的细粒度感知和复杂推理方面仍存在不足。

Method: 引入了MMSU基准，包含了47个任务和5000个音频问题答案三元组，涵盖了广泛的语言现象。

Result: 通过对14个先进语音大语言模型的严格评估，发现现有模型有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: MMSU为全面评估口语理解建立了新的标准，并为开发更复杂的AI-人类语音交互系统提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FineLogic, a new framework for evaluating logical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). It examines three aspects: overall accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. The study also explores how different types of supervision affect reasoning capabilities during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for logical reasoning in LLMs only measure final-answer accuracy, ignoring the quality and structure of the reasoning process.

Method: Introduce FineLogic framework with three dimensions of assessment. Conduct comprehensive study on the effects of four different supervision formats (one natural language and three symbolic variants) during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision leads to strong generalization on various tasks. Symbolic reasoning styles result in more structurally sound and atomic inference chains. Fine-tuning mainly improves reasoning behaviors via step-by-step generation.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a more rigorous and interpretable way to evaluate and improve logical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的结合CNN和BERT的机器翻译校对方法，实验显示其在错误检测和修正方面具有先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动翻译可能包含需要大量人工后期编辑的错误，因此机器翻译校对对于提高质量至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合方法，结合了卷积神经网络（CNN）和双向Transformer编码器表示（BERT）。使用CNN提取短语和表达式的语义信息，同时利用BERT创建序列的上下文丰富的表示。通过BERT的注意力过程，集成的错误检测组件关联标记以发现翻译异常。修正模块使用平行英德对齐和GRU解码器模型与翻译记忆结合，提出保持原始含义的逻辑修改。整个管道应用了针对后编辑性能优化的统一端到端训练过程。

Result: 在WMT的多域集合和Open-Subtitles的会话语料库上进行的实验达到了90%的准确率，F1值为89.37%，均方误差为16.24%，超过了最近的证明阅读技术超过10%的整体表现。

Conclusion: 实验达到了90%的准确率，F1值为89.37%，均方误差为16.24%，超过了最近的校对技术超过10%的整体表现。比较基准测试表明该方法在识别和连贯地纠正错误翻译和遗漏方面表现出最先进的性能。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)在印尼小学四年级学生手写考试答卷上的表现，发现VLM在手写识别上常出错并影响LLM评分，但LLM生成的反馈仍有实用价值，不过个人化和上下文相关性有待提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)在AI驱动教育评估中的应用，特别是在代表性不足的教育背景下的实际效果。

Method: 对来自印尼六所小学四年级学生的646份手写考试答卷进行评估，这些试卷包含超过14000个学生答案，涵盖选择题、简答题和作文题，并执行评分和生成个性化反馈的任务。

Result: VLM在识别学生手写内容时经常出错，这影响了后续LLM评分的准确性。然而，LLM生成的反馈即使基于不完美的输入也具有一定的实用价值，但仍存在个人化和上下文相关性的限制。

Conclusion: 尽管视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)在AI驱动的教育评估方面提供了有希望的机会，但在现实世界课堂环境中，尤其是在代表性不足的教育背景下，其有效性仍然未被充分探索。本研究发现，VLM常常难以准确识别学生的手写内容，这导致下游LLM评分中的错误传播。然而，即使输入不完美，LLM生成的反馈仍保留一定的实用性，但个人化和上下文相关性方面的局限依然存在。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

### [50] [A Reasoning-Based Approach to Cryptic Crossword Clue Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04824)
*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an LLM-based reasoning system that solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and using a verifier system. The system achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that can solve cryptic crossword clues effectively.

Method: An LLM-based reasoning system is built from open-licensed components. It hypothesizes answers, proposes wordplay explanations, and uses a verifier system that operates on codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and The Telegraph newspapers in the UK.

Conclusion: Each proved solution is expressed in Python, allowing interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers to be inspected.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [51] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RACE, a novel framework designed to detect hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by analyzing their reasoning traces and answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucination detection in LRMs, which current methods often fail to do effectively due to focusing only on answer-level uncertainty.

Method: RACE extracts essential reasoning steps and computes four diagnostic signals: consistency of reasoning traces across samples, answer uncertainty based on entropy, semantic alignment between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning.

Result: Experiments show that RACE outperforms existing baselines in detecting hallucinations in LRMs across various datasets and language models.

Conclusion: RACE provides a robust and generalizable method for evaluating the reliability of LRMs by addressing issues related to their reasoning traces.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents MockConf, a dataset of student simultaneous interpreting, and InterAlign, a tool for aligning parallel texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop datasets and tools for analyzing, monitoring, and evaluating the task of simultaneous interpreting.

Method: Collecting MockConf dataset from Mock Conferences and developing InterAlign tool.

Result: A dataset containing 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words, along with a web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations.

Conclusion: The MockConf dataset and InterAlign tool provide valuable resources for the study of simultaneous interpreting.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) for educational assessment, with GPT-3.5 showing the most effective results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating AI in educational settings has brought new learning approaches, and educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort.

Method: This paper presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and challenging MCQs. The approach does not rely on the knowledge of the LLM, but instead injects the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations, giving educators control over the test's source text.

Result: The experiment involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs across several known metrics.

Conclusion: This study sheds light on the potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience, providing valuable insights for the future.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores the effectiveness of isometric machine translation across multiple language pairs using eight open-source large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration selection influence translation quality and length control.

Method: Using eight open-source large language models, the study investigates the influence of different prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration selection on translation quality and length control.

Result: The study finds that the phrasing of instructions plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Few-shot prompting generally enhances translation quality, but further improvements are marginal across 5, 10, and 20-shot settings. Considering multiple outputs improves the overall tradeoff between length and quality, yielding state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Conclusion: The study concludes that isometric machine translation can be effective across multiple language pairs using large language models.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

TL;DR: This paper shows that incorporating Universal Dependencies into pretrained language models improves their performance on cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of UD

Method: Integrating UD into pretrained language models

Result: Incorporation of UD yields significant improvements in accuracy and F1 scores, with average gains of 3.85% and 6.08% respectively.

Conclusion: UD integration improves the performance of pretrained language models on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Method: 提出ICPC-Eval，包括从11个最近的ICPC竞赛中精心策划的问题，提供了一个具有实际比赛问题类型和难度分布的真实ICPC竞赛场景，提供了一种强大的测试用例生成方法和相应的本地评估工具包，并提供了一种有效的测试时扩展评估指标Refine@K。

Result: 顶级推理模型如DeepSeek-R1通常依赖于多轮代码反馈来充分释放其上下文推理潜力，而与非推理对手相比。尽管在代码生成方面取得了近期进展，但这些模型仍然落后于顶尖的人类团队。

Conclusion: 我们发布基准测试集在https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Slow_Thinking_with_LLMs。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark called Verbose ListOps has been introduced to test nested narrative reasoning in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test nested narrative reasoning in LLMs due to lack of realistic distractors or inability to separate context length from reasoning complexity.

Method: Verbose ListOps transposes ListOps computations into lengthy stories, requiring internal computation and state management without intermediate results.

Result: Leading LLMs perform poorly on Verbose ListOps even at modest narrative lengths, despite excelling at raw ListOps equations.

Conclusion: Addressing LLM limitations in nested reasoning is crucial for real-world text interpretation and could lead to advancements in automating knowledge work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

TL;DR: This paper compares a fine-tuning approach and a hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models approach for ASR systems in low-resource languages, showing that the latter achieves better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective ASR systems for low-resource languages.

Method: Combining hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models.

Result: Achieved 32% relative WER reduction over the best fine-tuned Whisper model on Scottish Gaelic.

Conclusion: The hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models approach outperforms the fine-tuning approach for ASR systems in low-resource languages.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

TL;DR: This work explores the use of large language models in providing multilingual instructional support, finding that multilingual hints improve learning outcomes especially in low-resource languages when feedback matches the student's native language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the ability of large language models to provide effective instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks.

Method: Simulating multilingual tutor-student interactions using large language models, exploring 352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies.

Result: Multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native language.

Conclusion: The study offers practical insights for developing multilingual, LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConECT, a new Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset with images and metadata, and investigates various methods for context-aware translation, showing that incorporating contextual information improves translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve translation quality in domain-specific applications like e-commerce where word ambiguity and poor data quality are common.

Method: Create ConECT dataset with 11,400 sentence pairs, test vision-language model and incorporate contextual information into text-to-text models.

Result: Incorporating contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine translation.

Conclusion: Adding contextual information, including visual context and product metadata, enhances translation quality in e-commerce.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

high-quality English translation, we analyze LLMs' problem-solving
capabilities, consistency, and multilingual performance. Our empirical study
reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to
top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on
complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain
with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of
LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality
editorial content, offering instructors a powerful tool to enhance student
feedback. The insights and best practices discussed herein pave the way for
further integration of generative AI in advanced algorithm education.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an incremental semi-supervised learning approach for ASR fine-tuning in domains with scarce labeled data, showing better performance than single-step fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is difficult due to scarcity of labeled data, but unlabeled audio and labeled data from related domains are usually available.

Method: Incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline integrating in-domain labeled data and auxiliary data from related domains, iterative refinement of pseudo-labels using filtering methods such as multi-model consensus and named entity recognition (NER).

Result: Relative improvement of 4% over no auxiliary data, up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection.

Conclusion: The proposed incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline shows significant improvements over single-step fine-tuning, especially when using consensus-based filtering.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

*Yongjie Xiao,Hongru Liang,Peixin Qin,Yao Zhang,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SCOP to evaluate large language models' comprehension process from a cognitive perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rational explanations for whether LLMs' comprehension aligns with experts'

Method: Defining five skills, constructing testing data, analyzing open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using testing data

Result: LLMs face challenges in expert-level comprehension, share some similarities with experts, and can be unreliable sometimes

Conclusion: Future improvement directions of LLMs should focus more on their comprehension process

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

TL;DR: This paper presents a simple method to control the length of automatic text summaries by adjusting the importance of predicting the end-of-sentence (EOS) token in the loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling text length in generation tasks often require complex model changes, which limit their compatibility with pre-trained models.

Method: The authors propose to increase the importance of correctly predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss calculation to control summary length.

Result: The method was tested on both encoder-decoder and GPT-style language models, showing its ability to control generation length without significantly impacting summary quality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is architecture-agnostic, compatible with various decoding algorithms, and can be used alongside other length-control techniques at inference time.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

TL;DR: This paper presents AR-Checker, a novel framework that evaluates the robustness of large language models by generating mathematical problem variants that may challenge them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the robustness issues and unexpected failures of LLMs in simple reasoning tasks, especially due to potential data contamination in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets.

Method: The AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification, tailored to each LLM to minimize data contamination risks.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on both mathematical and other reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed AR-Checker framework effectively evaluates the robustness of LLMs across various tasks, proving its versatility and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating LLM judges based on debate speech evaluation. It explores cognitive abilities that haven't been given much attention before.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating debate speeches which require a deep understanding of the speech at multiple levels.

Method: Using a dataset of over 600 annotated debate speeches, comparing state-of-the-art LLMs with human judges.

Result: Larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some aspects but differ significantly in overall judgment behavior. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive, opinionated speeches reaching human level.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into the cognitive abilities of LLMs and suggests further research is needed to improve their overall judgment behavior.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses whether large language models can exhibit introspection by analyzing two examples of self-reports, concluding that only the inference of the model's temperature parameter qualifies as a minimal form of introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the concept of introspection in relation to the increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities of large language models.

Method: Analysis of two examples of apparent introspective self-reports from LLMs.

Result: One example of self-reported 'creative' writing was not considered a valid example of introspection, whereas the correct inference of the model's own temperature parameter was considered a minimal example of introspection.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while large language models can produce self-reports, only the inference of the value of its own temperature parameter qualifies as a minimal example of introspection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

*Tianjiao Li,Mengran Yu,Chenyu Shi,Yanjun Zhao,Xiaojing Liu,Qiang Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang,Jiayin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) have excellent multilingual capabilities. Combining RLHF with translation tasks shows great potential. However, this paradigm performs poorly in colloquial subtitle translation tasks. This is due to the divergence of the offline reward model (RM) from the online LLM because of distributional shift. A new adversarial training framework called RIVAL is proposed to solve this problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why combining RLHF with translation tasks performs poorly in colloquial subtitle translation tasks.

Method: Propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. Iteratively update both models, train the RM to distinguish strong from weak translations, and train the LLM to enhance its translation for closing this gap. Incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM to stabilize training and improve generalizability.

Result: Demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Conclusion: The divergence of the offline reward model (RM) from the online LLM due to distributional shift leads to undesirable training outcomes. The proposed adversarial training framework can effectively solve this problem.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

*Soumitra Ghosh,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Shambhavi,Sabarna Choudhury,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method to enhance large language models' ability to detect self-harm signals on social media by considering language-emoji interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying self-harm intent aids suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current LLMs struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and emojis.

Method: We present a unified framework that enriches inputs using CESM-100, fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning, and generates explainable rationales for self-harm predictions.

Result: The proposed method improves the detection and explanation tasks of self-harm signals across different scenarios and LLMs.

Conclusion: Our approach enhances LLM performance in detecting self-harm signals and explaining these predictions, which helps address the ambiguity in self-harm signals.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

TL;DR: This study uses AI to analyze the impact of street-level features on commercial vitality in Harbin, China.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how street-level features impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China.

Method: An image-based framework was used to examine the impact of various street-level features on retail performance and user satisfaction using street view imagery and a multimodal large language model.

Result: Moderate vehicle presence may enhance commercial access, but excessive on-street parking reduces walkability and satisfaction. Higher perceived greenery and cleanliness increase satisfaction scores but have weak associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle presence.

Conclusion: This study shows the importance of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban morphological analysis to understand the factors driving commercial success.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework called CL-ISR that uses contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning to detect misleading texts on social media more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading texts on social media can cause public misunderstanding, social panic, and economic losses, so detecting them is important.

Method: The paper proposes a framework named CL-ISR which combines contrastive learning to enhance semantic difference understanding and implicit stance reasoning to explore hidden stance tendencies.

Result: The proposed CL-ISR framework improves the detection accuracy of misleading texts especially in linguistically complex situations by capturing subtle distinctions and hidden stances.

Conclusion: The integration of contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning in CL-ISR significantly enhances the performance of misleading text detection on social media.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel approach that combines W2V and Phi-4 MLLM to enhance spoken language assessment by overcoming the limitations of BERT and W2V alone. The proposed method achieved second place in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of BERT-based methods lacking prosodic and phonetic cues and W2V-based methods lacking semantic interpretability in spoken language assessment.

Method: Integrating W2V with Phi-4 MLLM using a score fusion strategy.

Result: Achieved an RMSE of 0.375 on the official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, ranking second.

Conclusion: The integration of W2V and Phi-4 MLLM through score fusion provides a promising direction for improving spoken language assessment.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method called DiCoRe improves zero-shot Event Detection by using two components: Dreamer for divergent reasoning and Grounder for convergent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Models struggle with complex event ontologies and domain-specific trigger extraction in specialized domains.

Method: DiCoRe framework includes Dreamer for divergent reasoning and Grounder for convergent reasoning, with an LLM-Judge for verifying outputs.

Result: DiCoRe outperforms previous methods across six datasets in five domains, improving average F1 by 4-7%.

Conclusion: DiCoRe establishes itself as a strong zero-shot Event Detection framework.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Result: 在处理具有更高m-local entropy的语言时，Transformer和LSTM语言模型的学习难度增加。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型对语言的局部统计结构高度敏感，类似于人类。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Motivation: 理解大型音频语言模型(LALMs)的内部机制对于解释其行为和提高性能至关重要。这项工作首次深入分析了LALMs如何内部感知和识别听觉属性。

Method: 通过对三个最先进的LALMs应用词汇投影，追踪属性信息在不同层和标记位置的变化。

Result: 属性信息通常随着层深度的增加而减少，当识别失败时，更早层的属性识别与更好的准确性相关联。此外，LALMs严重依赖查询听觉输入来预测属性，而不是在属性提及位置的隐藏状态中聚合必要的信息。

Conclusion: 我们的研究提供了对听觉属性处理的见解，为未来的改进铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

### [78] [Do Large Language Models Judge Error Severity Like Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05142)
*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares human and large language model (LLM) assessments of image descriptions with controlled semantic errors, revealing that while humans vary in severity judgments based on visual context, most LLMs poorly replicate these judgments, with only Doubao showing human-like rankings and DeepSeek-V3 performing best overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in natural language generation.

Method: Systematically comparing human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing four error types (age, gender, clothing type, and colour) in both unimodal and multimodal settings.

Result: Humans assign varying severities to different error types, with visual context increasing perceived severity for colour and type errors. Most LLMs give low scores to gender errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors. Doubao replicates human-like rankings but lacks clear distinction between error types. DeepSeek-V3 shows highest alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle to replicate human error severity judgments due to differences in perceptual grounding and internalized social norms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

*Chenyu Lin,Yilin Wen,Du Su,Fei Sun,Muhan Chen,Chenfu Bao,Zhonghou Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Knowledgeable-r1, an improved retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. It addresses issues caused by over-reliance on retrieved contexts by stimulating the self-integrated use of parametric and contextual knowledge through joint sampling and multi-policy distributions. Experiments demonstrate its enhanced performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems often rely too much on retrieved contexts, which can be inaccurate or misleading, and overlook the model's inherent knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledgeable-r1, which uses joint sampling and defines multi-policy distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate the self-integrated use of parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Knowledgeable-r1 shows significant improvements in robustness and reasoning accuracy in parameter and contextual conflict tasks as well as general RAG tasks, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios and showing consistent gains across RAG tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances the use of retrieved contexts and the model's inherent knowledge, leading to better performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

*Bhavik Chandna,Zubair Bashir,Procheta Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses a mechanistic interpretability approach to explore how social, demographic, and gender biases are represented within LLMs and finds that bias-related computations are highly localized and removal of these components reduces biased outputs but also impacts other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social, demographic, and gender biases are represented within Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-2 and Llama2.

Method: Adopting a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how biases are structurally represented within models.

Result: Bias-related computations are highly localized in a small subset of layers and the identified components change across fine-tuning settings.

Conclusion: Bias-related computations are highly localized and removing these components can reduce biased outputs but also affect other NLP tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks by focusing on evidentiality-guided context compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, limiting LLM-based RAG performance.

Method: Proposes ECoRAG framework, which compresses retrieved documents based on evidentiality and ensures correct evidence support for answer generation.

Result: ECoRAG outperforms existing compression methods in ODQA tasks and is cost-efficient by reducing latency and token usage.

Conclusion: ECoRAG enhances LLM performance on ODQA tasks with better efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Motivation: To enhance text embedding and reranking abilities.

Method: Using Qwen3 LLMs' capabilities in multilingual text understanding and generation, employing a multi-stage training pipeline with unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets, and applying effective model merging strategies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks in text embedding and various retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series is publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license to promote community-driven research and development.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: This study explores in-context counterfactual reasoning in large-scale language models, showing they can perform noise abduction in regression tasks and suggesting potential for counterfactual story generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the capability of language models in counterfactual reasoning, particularly their ability to infer and copy contextual noise.

Method: Conducted experiments using a linear regression task requiring noise abduction, analyzing factors like self-attention, model depth, and data diversity in Transformers.

Result: Language models demonstrated counterfactual reasoning capabilities in the controlled setup, with performance driven by specific Transformer characteristics.

Conclusion: Findings suggest that counterfactual reasoning for many functions can be reduced to transformations on in-context observations, with implications for broader applications including counterfactual story generation.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RELIC, a framework for evaluating large language models' instruction-following abilities through language recognition tasks. It finds that even advanced LLMs struggle with complex grammars, showing near-chance performance, and tend to rely on simple heuristics when tasks become too difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of large language models in understanding and applying complex instructions without examples.

Method: Evaluating LLMs on RELIC by testing their ability to recognize strings generated by formal grammars.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show limited accuracy on complex grammars and often resort to simple heuristics rather than following instructions.

Conclusion: The RELIC framework provides a scalable way to measure LLMs' instruction-following abilities and reveals limitations in current models' capacity to handle complex tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Motivation: To address the issues of intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns when training LLMs on unlicensed text, and to create a dataset that is large enough and high-quality enough to produce performant LLMs.

Method: Collecting, curating, and releasing the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text designed for LLM pretraining.

Result: The Common Pile v0.1 comprises content from 30 sources that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books, encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Two 7 billion parameter LLMs were trained on it and both attained competitive performance to LLMs trained on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 is an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text that can be used for LLM pretraining. Two 7 billion parameter LLMs were trained on it, showing competitive performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

TL;DR: Self-supervised methods are explored for character-level tasks, particularly morphological inflection, in low-resource languages using encoder-decoder transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large-scale unlabeled data for character-level tasks in under-resourced languages.

Method: Training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives including autoencoding and character masked language modeling.

Result: Autoencoding works best with limited data while CMLM becomes more effective with more data. Biased objectives don't outperform standard CMLM but sampling masks based on morpheme boundaries improves performance.

Conclusion: Sampling masks based on morpheme boundaries shows promise for low-resource morphological modeling.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同的形式主义被认为是独立且不收敛的分析系统，需要一个统一的系统来处理语法不连续现象

Method: 结合短语结构语法（PSG），依存语法（DG）和范畴语法（CG）三种形式主义的特点

Result: 通过统一的数学推导可以分析不连续表达式和连续结构

Conclusion: 提出了一种统一的表示方法来处理自然语言中的连续和不连续结构。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a 3-step reasoning process to improve hallucination detection by guiding large language models to perform systematic and comprehensive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to generate more accurate and fine-grained entailment decisions by performing a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process.

Method: Defining a 3-step reasoning process including claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and aggregated classification.

Result: Improved performance in hallucination detection.

Conclusion: Guided reasoning can lead to increased performance in hallucination detection tasks.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: Micro-Act is a novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems more effectively than existing methods, improving question answering accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge conflicts between external knowledge and parametric knowledge in large language models negatively impact downstream tasks like question answering.

Method: Micro-Act uses a hierarchical action space to perceive context complexity and break down knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons for better conflict resolution.

Result: Micro-Act improves question answering accuracy significantly over other methods on five benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in temporal and semantic conflict types.

Conclusion: The proposed Micro-Act framework effectively addresses knowledge conflicts in RAG systems, enhancing performance in both conflicting and non-conflicting scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error propagation and sub-optimal performance in agentic workflows due to poorly designed prompts limit reliability and scalability of AI systems.

Method: ProRefine dynamically refines prompts leveraging textual feedback from large language models without additional training or ground truth labels.

Result: ProRefine improves performance significantly on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, surpassing zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points.

Conclusion: ProRefine enhances accuracy and enables smaller models to match larger ones, promoting efficient and scalable AI deployment and wider access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

TL;DR: Proposes a new method for unlearning in large language models by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem with a novel loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information in real-world settings.

Method: A constrained optimization problem with a novel logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention.

Result: Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures show effectiveness in removing targeted information while maintaining downstream utility.

Conclusion: Our approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Result: The dataset revealed that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations and vary across cited sources. Performance of search-augmented LLMs was also tested in different settings.

Conclusion: The introduction of Search Arena provides a valuable resource for future research in search-augmented language models, highlighting the importance of citation quantity and source type in user preferences.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

### [93] [Flattery, Fluff, and Fog: Diagnosing and Mitigating Idiosyncratic Biases in Preference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05339)
*Anirudh Bharadwaj,Chaitanya Malaviya,Nitish Joshi,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models often misjudge human preferences due to biases in their training data, affecting qualities like length, structure, etc. The study finds models favor biased responses more than humans do, suggesting reliance on misleading cues. A method using counterfactual data augmentation helps reduce such biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the systematic miscalibration in language models' preference judgements due to training data biases.

Method: Systematically investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model miscalibration using controlled counterfactual pairs and propose a post-training method with counterfactual data augmentation.

Result: Preference models show significant miscalibration and favor biased responses in over 60% of cases. Post-training with CDA reduces miscalibration and skew difference effectively.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing through counterfactual data augmentation is effective in creating reliable preference models by reducing miscalibration and skew.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种新的方法来减少不当信息披露，同时保持任务表现，并证明了这种方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保上下文完整性(CI)，即在执行特定任务时，哪些信息是适当的共享内容，成为该领域的核心问题。作者认为CI需要一种推理形式，代理需要推理其正在操作的上下文。

Method: 首先提示大型语言模型(LLMs)在决定披露哪些信息时显式推理CI；然后通过开发强化学习(RL)框架进一步培养模型实现CI所需的推理能力。

Result: 使用一个仅包含约700个例子的合成数据集（具有多样的上下文和信息披露规范），我们展示了我们的方法在保持多种模型大小和家族的任务性能的同时，显著减少了不适当的信息披露。

Conclusion: 改进从这个合成数据集转移到了有人类注释且评估AI助手行动和工具调用隐私泄露的现有CI基准PrivacyLens上。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG is a new method that improves large language models' ability to provide accurate information about the circular economy by using a knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of large language models often providing inaccurate industrial codes and emission factors, which can negatively impact regulatory and investment decisions.

Method: A retrieval-augmented generation framework that uses a domain-specific knowledge graph for the circular economy, allowing for structured multi-hop reasoning and ensuring accuracy and traceability through translated SPARQL queries and verified subgraphs.

Result: CircuGraphRAG outperforms standalone LLMs and naive RAG in single-hop and multi-hop question answering with higher ROUGE-L F1 scores, and improves efficiency by reducing response time and token usage.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG offers reliable support for circular economy planning and contributes to making more informed, low-carbon resource decisions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Matter-of-Fact, a dataset for evaluating the feasibility of scientific claims, showing current models struggle with this task despite its potential to accelerate scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost of running automated experiments which can be costly, particularly when run at scale.

Method: Introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims.

Result: Strong baselines fail to exceed 72% performance on this task while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable.

Conclusion: Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Motivation: To address the inconsistencies and fluctuations in the evaluation results of open-source inference models, particularly those based on the Deepseek-R1-Distill series.

Method: Empirical assessment of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models to understand the factors causing fluctuations in their performance evaluations.

Result: Found that subtle differences in evaluation conditions lead to significant variations in the performance results of these models.

Conclusion: Advocates for a more rigorous approach to model performance evaluation to ensure reliable reproduction of claimed improvements.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Motivation: To address the issue of explicit thought paths enabling goal-driven, intentional misinformation in advanced LLMs.

Method: Using representation engineering to induce, detect, and control deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting 'deception vectors' via Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT).

Result: Achieved 89% detection accuracy and a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: Unveils specific honesty-related issues of reasoning models and provides tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related

TL;DR: This paper introduces LFS, a novel LLM Self-Guided Search method that enables large language models to autonomously control the search process via self-guided exploration, demonstrating superior performance on challenging tasks without additional tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search methods rely on fixed exploration hyperparameters, limiting their adaptability across tasks of varying difficulty. This paper aims to remove the need for pre-defined search strategies.

Method: LLM-First Search (LFS) allows the LLM to autonomously control the search process through self-guided exploration, evaluating search paths based on internal scoring mechanisms.

Result: LFS outperforms other methods on challenging tasks, is more computationally efficient, scales better with stronger models, and scales better with increased compute budget.

Conclusion: LFS demonstrates the potential of LLMs in handling complex reasoning tasks without manual tuning or task-specific adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Introduces an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent that performs on par with humans in online games like Mafia, paving the way for LLM integration into human group settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses the need for adaptive asynchronous LLM-agents that can decide when to speak in communication settings without inherent notions of turns, such as group chats or social games.

Method: Developing an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent that determines both what and when to say.

Result: The developed agent performs comparably to human players in Mafia games, showing similar behavioral patterns in deciding when to speak but differing in message content.

Conclusion: This work supports integrating LLMs into realistic human group settings by providing tools and data for more realistic asynchronous communication.

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Result: 揭示了现有基准和模型主要关注行为系统性而非表示系统性的问题。

Conclusion: 强调表示系统性的重要性，并提出了评估机器学习模型表示系统性的方法。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method improves differentially private language model inference by clustering input data and using median computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately generated text, especially for heterogeneous topics. The goal is to improve the quality of private synthetic text generation.

Method: Clustering input data and using median computations instead of averages to aggregate next token statistics.

Result: Improved representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) and downstream task performance with higher quality synthetic data at lower privacy cost compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: This method enhances the quality of differentially private language model inference, particularly beneficial for handling heterogeneous topics.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: $Urania$ successfully balances data utility with privacy preservation by extracting meaningful conversational insights under strict privacy constraints.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM

It also investigates unstable model performance across different benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in reinforcement learning for long-context reasoning models.

Method: Systematic analysis of sample roles, exploration of data efficiency strategies, and investigation of model instability across benchmarks.

Result: Positive samples aid data fitting while negative samples boost generalization and robustness. Training only on negative samples performs comparably to standard RL training. Two strategies improve data usage efficiency. Multiple evaluation runs alleviate unstable performance.

Conclusion: Understanding sample roles, improving data efficiency, and addressing instability are crucial for advancing long-context reasoning models trained via reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SHARP, a framework with HAR contrastive loss to alleviate degree bias in node classification tasks of graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degree bias issue in node classification tasks of graph neural networks caused by the limited number of positive pairs and equal weighting of all positives and negatives in graph contrastive learning.

Method: SHARP framework including HAR contrastive loss that leverages node labels to add more positive pairs and adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness.

Result: The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that SHARP outperforms baselines at both global and degree levels.

Conclusion: The proposed SHARP framework, which includes the HAR contrastive loss, effectively mitigates degree bias in graph neural networks for node classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

TL;DR: Introduces Diagonal Batching to enhance RMTs' efficiency for long-context tasks by enabling parallelism without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sequential execution bottleneck in RMTs caused by its memory update mechanism, which limits parallel processing capabilities.

Method: Introducing Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that allows parallelism across segments in RMTs while maintaining exact recurrence.

Result: Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential RMT implementation on long sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching improves the efficiency of RMTs, making them a more practical choice for real-world long-context applications.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

TL;DR: Introduce a new RNN model that improves language modeling performance, especially for tasks requiring long context understanding, by optimizing an in-context loss using a conjugate gradient solver.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers require scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. Recent work linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful RNN models with constant memory and compute costs.

Method: Introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable version of the Mesa layer and study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. The layer stems from an in-context loss, minimized to optimality at every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver.

Result: Show that optimal test-time training enables reaching lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.

Conclusion: Optimal test-time training enables reaching lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

*Yifan Sun,Jingyan Shen,Yibin Wang,Tianyu Chen,Zhendong Wang,Mingyuan Zhou,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes two techniques to improve data efficiency in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection and develops an attention-based framework to estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently. It also introduces a rollout replay mechanism to reuse recent rollouts.

Result: The proposed method reduces reinforcement learning fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques improve data efficiency in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

*Ranajoy Sadhukhan,Zhuoming Chen,Haizhong Zheng,Yang Zhou,Emma Strubell,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper rethink test-time scaling laws and propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse attention, which improves test-time accuracy and outperforms dense counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work overlooks memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies. The effectiveness of smaller models is significantly overestimated.

Method: Holistic analysis of models from 0.6B to 32B parameters and proposing a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse attention.

Result: Sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts in problem-solving accuracy on AIME.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling laws need to consider both computation and memory access costs. Sparse attention is essential for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在Transformer大型语言模型中，生成成本受制于键值（KV）缓存的大小，而非生成的标记数量。本文提出了一种名为动态内存稀疏化（DMS）的新方法，通过压缩KV缓存来实现推理时间超扩展，从而在相同的计算预算内生成更多的标记，并进一步提高扩展推理的准确性。实验表明，这种方法能够显著提升多个LLM家族的准确性。例如，在AIME 24、GPQA和LiveCodeBench上，使用Qwen-R1 32B模型时分别平均提高了9.1、7.6和9.6分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时间扩展方法主要通过生成更长或更多并行序列来增加推理精度，但这些方法受限于KV缓存的大小。因此，本文旨在探索如何通过压缩KV缓存来提升推理精度。

Method: 提出了一种名为动态内存稀疏化（DMS）的方法，该方法只需要1K个训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩，同时保持比无训练稀疏注意力更好的准确性。DMS通过延迟缓存标记的丢弃，隐式地合并表示并保留关键信息。

Result: 在多个LLM家族上测试了推理时间超扩展的效果，结果显示DMS能有效提高推理准确性。例如，对于Qwen-R1 32B模型，在不同计算预算下，其在AIME 24、GPQA和LiveCodeBench上的准确率分别提升了9.1、7.6和9.6分。

Conclusion: 本文提出的DMS方法成功实现了推理时间的超扩展，能够在不显著增加计算资源的情况下提高推理精度。这项工作为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

*Ariadna Sanchez,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper explores using a large speech model to generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice before they develop the disorder. The authors investigate if Parler TTS can maintain speaker identity while generating intelligible speech. They fine-tune the model using a curated dataset, finding that it can generate from the challenging data distribution but struggles with intelligibility and speaker consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide personalized text-to-speech options as a communication aid for people with speech disorders.

Method: Using a large speech model (Parler TTS) to generate approximations of dysarthric speakers' voices. Fine-tuning the model on a curated dataset annotated with speaker and intelligibility information.

Result: The model can generate from the challenging data distribution but has difficulty controlling intelligibility and maintaining consistent speaker identity.

Conclusion: Future work is needed to improve the controllability of this class of models for the voice reconstruction task.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech language models enable end-to-end speech-text modelling within a single model, which is a promising direction for spoken dialogue systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality.

Method: Systematically comparing representative joint speech-text decoding strategies including the interleaved and parallel generation paradigms under a controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer and training data. Proposing a novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern.

Result: The interleaved approach achieves the best alignment. The proposed ESI pattern can significantly accelerate decoding and yield slightly better performance.

Conclusion: The interleaved approach achieves the best alignment but suffers from slow inference due to long token sequence length. The proposed ESI pattern can significantly accelerate decoding and yield slightly better performance.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical

also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality

Conclusion: 分析表明，EMO-Debias 是一个有效的多标签SER系统去偏方法，它能有效减少性别表现差距而不损害整体模型性能。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

TL;DR: This study examines whether publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms of LLM-based systems meet practitioners' needs. It finds that practitioners often cannot use these instruments due to misalignment or practical barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms of LLM-based systems are meeting the needs of practitioners.

Method: Semi-structured interviews with 12 practitioners.

Result: Practitioners face challenges using publicly available instruments due to misalignment with their needs or practical and institutional barriers.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided to address these challenges and better meet practitioner needs.

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

TL;DR: A new model is proposed to generate consistent phonemic and prosodic labels of speech with graphemes for downstream tasks like text-to-speech and accent estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are coherent with graphemes for various downstream tasks.

Method: Conditioning label generation on corresponding graphemes by adding implicit grapheme conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features and explicitly pruning label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during inference.

Result: The proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and the predicted labels. The created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed model improves the consistency between graphemes and predicted labels.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes LLM-P2G decoding for phoneme-based ASR, which improves performance in crosslingual ASR tasks for Polish and German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phoneme-based multilingual pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning are appealing due to their high data efficiency and competitive results. However, WFST-based decoding has limitations such as complex pipeline and inability to use LLMs.

Method: Proposed LLM-P2G decoding includes S2P and P2G, with two training strategies: DANP and TKM.

Result: LLM-P2G improves performance in crosslingual ASR tasks for Polish and German with relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%, respectively.

Conclusion: LLM-P2G decoding surpasses WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR tasks for Polish and German.

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse uses zero-shot large language models to enhance sparse retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving sparse retrieval performance with less computational cost.

Method: Introducing a fusion ranking framework that combines original and LLM-augmented queries.

Result: Outperforms other LLM-based methods and achieves SOTA on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse effectively improves sparse retrieval through query expansion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer uses smaller LMs to generate documents and filters out non-factual or inconsistent sentences before combining them with the original query.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The cost and computational requirements of LLMs make them inaccessible for many users.

Method: GOLFer has two modules: a hallucination filter and a documents combiner.

Result: GOLFer performs well on both web search and low-resource datasets.

Conclusion: GOLFer demonstrates effectiveness in query expansion using smaller LMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ColPali/ColQwen2在视觉化文档检索(VDR)中表现强劲，但其将每页编码为多个patch级别的嵌入，导致内存使用量过大。

Method: 本实证研究调查了在最小性能下降的情况下减少每页patch嵌入的方法。我们评估了两种token减少策略：token剪枝和token合并。

Result: 对于token剪枝，我们惊讶地发现，一种简单的随机策略的表现优于其他复杂的剪枝方法，但仍然远未令人满意。进一步分析表明，剪枝本质上不适合VDR，因为它需要在没有查询特定信息的情况下删除某些页面嵌入。转向更适合VDR的token合并，我们在三个维度上搜索最佳合并策略组合并开发了Light-ColPali/ColQwen2。它在仅占原始内存使用量11.8%的情况下保持了98.2%的检索性能，并在仅占2.8%内存占用的情况下保留了94.6%的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们希望我们的实证发现和由此产生的Light-ColPali/ColQwen2能为未来高效VDR的研究提供有价值的见解并建立一个竞争性的基线。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

TL;DR: This paper presents ReXVQA, a large VQA benchmark in chest radiology with over 696,000 questions. It introduces diverse tasks reflecting five key radiological skills. MedGemma outperforms other models achieving 83.24% accuracy. A human study shows MedGemma surpasses radiology residents (83.84% vs 77.27%). ReXVQA provides public leaderboards and detailed evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more comprehensive and clinically relevant VQA benchmark in chest radiology that reflects real-world radiological reasoning skills.

Method: Introducing ReXVQA with diverse tasks and evaluating eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models.

Result: MedGemma achieves the highest accuracy of 83.24%. In the human study, it outperforms radiology residents with an accuracy of 83.84% compared to the best resident's 77.27%.

Conclusion: ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems and paves the way for advanced AI systems mimicking expert clinical reasoning.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing

### [122] [Interpretable Multimodal Framework for Human-Centered Street Assessment: Integrating Visual-Language Models for Perceptual Urban Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05087)
*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study presents a new framework called Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) which combines a vision transformer and a large language model to evaluate streetscapes. The framework was fine-tuned using data from Harbin, China and achieved high accuracy in assessing both objective features and subjective perceptions of streets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture subjective perceptions essential to inclusive urban design which are not covered by objective street metrics.

Method: Introducing a novel Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4). The framework was fine-tuned using LoRA and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated resident perceptions. It also captured context-dependent contradictions and identified nonlinear and semantically contingent patterns.

Conclusion: MSEF offers methodological innovation in urban perception modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为CIVET的新框架，用于系统性评估视觉-语言模型对场景中物体属性和关系的理解能力，发现现有模型在这些方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉-语言模型在理解场景的基础结构和语义方面的表现。

Method: 引入了CIVET框架，这是一个用于系统性评估的创新且可扩展的方法，通过受控刺激来进行评估。

Result: 五种最先进的视觉语言模型在没有注释噪声、数据集特定偏差和不受控制的场景复杂性的情况下，对广泛的刺激进行了评估。发现当前模型只能准确识别有限的基本物体属性，性能依赖于物体在场景中的位置，并且难以理解物体间的基本关系。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在理解基本物体属性方面表现有限，其性能高度依赖于物体在场景中的位置，并且难以理解物体间的基本关系。此外，与人类注释者进行的比较评估表明，视觉语言模型仍未能达到人类水平的准确性。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

TL;DR: A new dataset called VideoMarathon and a model named Hour-LLaVA are introduced. VideoMarathon is a large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset with 3.3M QA pairs across six topics. Hour-LLaVA is a Video-LMM that can handle hour-long video-language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of well-annotated long videos for training hour-long Video-LLMs.

Method: Introduce VideoMarathon dataset and Hour-LLaVA model with a memory augmentation module for adaptive integration of relevant semantics.

Result: Hour-LLaVA performs best on multiple long video-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA demonstrate high quality and superior performance in handling long video-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型在下游微调时的安全性问题，发现上游安全对齐数据与下游任务数据集表征的相似性对模型的安全性有重大影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解策略主要集中在安全护栏被突破后的反应式处理、微调期间去除有害梯度或在整个微调过程中持续强化安全对齐等方面，但这些方法往往忽略了上游的一个关键因素：原始安全对齐数据的角色。

Method: 通过分析上、下游数据集表征相似性对大语言模型安全性的影响，研究揭示了上游安全对齐数据的作用。

Result: 高相似性导致安全防护减弱，模型更容易受到越狱攻击；而低相似性则使模型更加健壮，显著降低了有害性评分。

Conclusion: 实验表明，上、下游数据集表征相似性显著影响大语言模型的安全性。高相似性会削弱安全防护，而低相似性则能大幅提高模型鲁棒性，降低有害性评分最高可达10.33%。这项研究强调了上游数据集设计对构建持久安全防护和减少现实世界中越狱攻击漏洞的重要性，并为微调服务提供商提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.
