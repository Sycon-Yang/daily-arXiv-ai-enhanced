### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: We propose GEM, a simple self-supervised approach that enables large decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings without compromising their original text generation and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of relying on separate embedding models in many applications like retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of the query between the embedding model and LLMs.

Method: Inserting new special token(s) into a text body, and generating summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention mask.

Result: The results show that our proposed method significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact on MMLU.

Conclusion: Our proposed method significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact on MMLU.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can handle various accents well, especially those unseen. It's better to have more speakers with shorter audio contributions rather than fewer speakers with longer contributions. Increasing the number of speakers improves ASR performance. However, accent diversity among speakers doesn't significantly enhance ASR performance if the number of speakers is fixed. Therefore, for new languages, focus on adding more speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an ASR system that works universally across many accents, including those not previously encountered.

Method: Systematically examine how three aspects of training data (number of speakers, individual speaker duration, and accent diversity) impact ASR robustness against unseen accents under limited resources.

Result: More speakers with less audio per speaker lead to better ASR performance. Scaling hours benefits from having more speakers. Accent diversity has little effect when the number of speakers is constant.

Conclusion: For new languages, prioritize increasing the number of speakers in ASR training data.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal structure of sentence embeddings which are central to modern NLP and AI systems but have untraceable content due to complex neural transformations and pooling operations.

Method: Using dictionary learning on token-level representations to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components.

Result: The method reveals that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Conclusion: This work bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making for more transparent and controllable representations.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces HTC-CLIP, a novel approach combining label hierarchy encoding and text encoding for hierarchical text classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hierarchical text classification performance by integrating complementary label hierarchy characteristics.

Method: Proposes HTC-CLIP that uses contrastive learning to create hierarchy-aware text and text-informed path guided hierarchy representations.

Result: Shows an improvement of 0.99-2.37% in Macro F1 score on public datasets compared to current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Combining separate label hierarchy encoding and text guided hierarchy approaches into one architecture enhances HTC performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese, finds smaller fine-tuned models often outperform larger ones, highlights importance of prior exposure to the language and trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the performance of large language models on a low-resource language, Maltese.

Method: Conduct experiments on 55 publicly available LLMs using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks.

Result: Many models perform poorly, especially on generative tasks. Smaller fine-tuned models often perform better. Prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning is the most important factor. Fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost but yields better performance and lower inference costs.

Conclusion: Need for more inclusive language technologies and recommendation for researchers to consider more 'traditional' language modelling approaches when working with low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a model that improves intent classification accuracy by 20-23% using limited labeled data across different customer care domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an intent classifier that works well across various domains (channel, geography, language) with minimal annotated data, addressing the data bottleneck issue.

Method: An embedder-cum-classifier model architecture is used, involving supervised fine-tuning with isotropic regularizers and multilingual knowledge distillation.

Result: The proposed method shows a significant increase in accuracy compared to existing pre-trained models when tested on Canada and Mexico e-commerce datasets.

Conclusion: The model effectively generalizes across domains with few annotations, demonstrating substantial improvement in intent classification.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Abstract: We introduce MedAgentGYM, the first publicly available training environment
designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth
annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive
benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between
commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging
MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ability of human-scale transformer language models to generalize from frequent to rare constructions, focusing on both form and meaning of the English LET-ALONE construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the gap regarding the understanding of how widespread the generalization ability is in language models and to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as opposed to just their forms.

Method: The method involves testing human-scale transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of the rare English LET-ALONE construction.

Result: The result shows that human-scale LMs are sensitive to form but do not correctly generalize about LET-ALONE's meaning.

Conclusion: The study concludes that there is an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample efficiency between language form and meaning for human-scale transformer language models.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that can predict the perceived emotions of the speaker from a given text snippet using an ensemble of models.

Method: Using an ensemble of models to predict emotions without additional model training.

Result: Achieves results comparable to the best performing systems while being more efficient, scalable, and easier to implement.

### [10] [Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04458)
*Xueqiang Xu,Jinfeng Xiao,James Barry,Mohab Elkaref,Jiaru Zou,Pengcheng Jiang,Yunyi Zhang,Max Giammona,Geeth de Mel,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces ZOES, a novel approach for entity structure extraction that doesn't require any schema or annotated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on predefined schemas or annotated datasets, leading to incomplete extraction results.

Method: A principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification.

Result: Consistently enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains.

Conclusion: ZOES improves the ability of LLMs to extract more complete entity structures without using predefined schemas or annotated samples.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how two common watermarking methods affect the alignment properties of four large language models. It identifies two types of degradation and proposes a new method called Alignment Resampling to recover alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the impact of watermarking on the truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness of large language models.

Method: Systematic analysis of two watermarking approaches (Gumbel and KGW) on four aligned LLMs.

Result: Two degradation patterns were found: guard attenuation and guard amplification. A new method called Alignment Resampling was proposed and shown to recover or surpass baseline alignment scores.

Conclusion: The balance between watermark strength and model alignment is crucial. The proposed inference-time solution can help responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheng Li,Tianyi Liu,Haodong Wang,Hyokun Yun,Ming Zeng,Pei Chen,Zhihan Zhang,Yifan Gao,Ruijie Wang,Priyanka Nigam,Bing Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC框架利用用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐式偏好来生成对大语言模型（LLMs）的偏好数据，从而改善LLMs生成人类偏好的响应质量。实验表明，结合DPO和PUGC训练的模型在Alpaca Eval 2上比传统方法提高了9.37%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖于人工或高级LLMs提供的标注数据，成本高且难以扩展。本文提出利用用户生成内容中的隐式偏好来生成偏好数据，以降低偏好学习的成本并提高其可扩展性。

Method: 提出PUGC框架，该框架将用户生成的内容转化为用户查询，并从策略模型生成响应。然后利用这些用户生成的内容作为参考文本对响应进行评分，使模型与隐式偏好对齐。

Result: 在Alpaca Eval 2上的实验显示，结合DPO和PUGC训练的模型实现了9.37%的性能提升，达到了35.93%的长度控制胜率新纪录。此外，还观察到奖励质量、领域特定对齐效果、对UGC质量的鲁棒性以及理论思维能力方面的改进。

Conclusion: 通过使用用户生成的内容中的隐式偏好，PUGC框架能够有效地改善LLMs生成人类偏好的响应质量，同时降低了偏好学习的成本并提高了其可扩展性。这项工作为LLMs的偏好学习提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

### [13] [SQLens: An End-to-End Framework for Error Detection and Correction in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04494)
*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes SQLens, an end-to-end framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models generate semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid SQL queries, lacking reliability insights.

Method: SQLens integrates error signals from the database and LLM to identify and correct potential semantic errors within SQL clauses.

Result: SQLens surpasses the best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and enhances execution accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens is an effective tool for improving the reliability of LLM-generated SQL.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

### [14] [DRE: An Effective Dual-Refined Method for Integrating Small and Large Language Models in Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04516)
*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method integrating small and large language models via adaptive weighting is introduced to improve evaluation tools, especially for open-ended tasks like dialogue evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs) in handling ambiguous scenarios and adversarial inputs respectively.

Method: SLIDE and Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) methods are proposed to integrate SLMs and LLMs through adaptive weighting and refinement.

Result: DRE outperforms existing methods and shows better alignment with human judgment across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining small and large models can create more reliable evaluation tools for open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

### [15] [Please Translate Again: Two Simple Experiments on Whether Human-Like Reasoning Helps Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04521)
*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines whether breaking down the translation process into multiple steps using large language models improves translation quality. The authors found that simply asking the model to 'translate again' often produced better results than more complex step-by-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if explicit task decomposition via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves translation performance for large language models.

Method: An empirical study comparing different prompting strategies for large language models in translation tasks, including step-by-step decomposition and refinement versus a simpler 'translate again' approach.

Result: No clear evidence was found that explicitly decomposing the translation process improves performance; in fact, the 'translate again' method often yielded better results.

Conclusion: The role of reasoning in translation tasks remains unclear and calls for further exploration of factors affecting CoT's effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

### [16] [Is It JUST Semantics? A Case Study of Discourse Particle Understanding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04534)
*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how well large language models can understand the different meanings of the discourse particle 'just'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of LLMs in recognizing the subtle nuances of discourse particles.

Method: Using data crafted and labeled by expert linguists.

Result: LLMs can differentiate broader categories but struggle with subtler nuances.

Conclusion: There is a gap in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Motivation: To show the importance and feasibility of benchmarking LLMs on questions without answers.

Method: Present a new benchmark and a method to modify existing datasets.

### [18] [SSA-COMET: Do LLMs Outperform Learned Metrics in Evaluating MT for Under-Resourced African Languages?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04557)
*Senyu Li,Jiayi Wang,Felermino D. M. A. Ali,Colin Cherry,Daniel Deutsch,Eleftheria Briakou,Rui Sousa-Silva,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pontus Stenetorp,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work introduces SSA-MTE, a large-scale MTE dataset for 13 African language pairs, and develops improved evaluation metrics, SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, which outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with state-of-the-art LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating MT quality for under-resourced African languages is challenging due to limited language coverage, poor performance in low-resource settings, small evaluation sets, lack of tailored training data, and inconsistent performance in extremely low-resource scenarios.

Method: Developed SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE metrics based on a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation dataset (SSA-MTE), and benchmarked prompting-based approaches using LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude.

Result: SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with the strongest LLM evaluated in the study, especially for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: This work provides valuable resources and methods to improve MT evaluation for under-resourced African languages.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models can be exploited by malicious agents in multi-agent systems through subtle prompt manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore integrity attacks in multi-agent systems using large language models.

Method: Examining four types of attacks: Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, and Free-Rider.

Result: Strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic biases in multi-agent system behavior and executable instructions, allowing malicious agents to mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.

Conclusion: Current detection mechanisms may not be sufficient to prevent these attacks, emphasizing the need for more robust security protocols and monitoring systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

### [20] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示，对于金融情感分析，未经链式思维提示的GPT-4o表现最佳，挑战了更多推理会带来更好决策的常规认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（包括推理型和非推理型）在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，评估不同大型语言模型和提示策略在金融语境下与人类标注情感的一致性。比较三种专有大型语言模型（GPT-4o，GPT-4.1，o3-mini）在模拟系统1（快速且直观）或系统2（缓慢且审慎）思维的不同提示范式下的表现，并将其与两个经过金融情感分析微调的小型模型（FinBERT-Prosus，FinBERT-Tone）进行基准测试。

Result: 最准确且与人类对齐的组合是未经CoT提示的GPT-4o。推理可能引入过度思考，导致次优预测。快速、直观的思维方式比缓慢、审慎的推理更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: 推理，无论是通过提示还是固有模型设计，在此任务上并不能提高性能。令人惊讶的是，最准确且与人类对齐的模型和方法组合是未经链式思维（CoT）提示的GPT-4o。我们进一步探索了语言复杂性和注释一致水平对性能的影响，发现推理可能会导致过度思考，从而导致次优预测。这表明对于金融情感分类来说，快速、直观的“系统1”式的思维方式比“系统2”风格的缓慢、审慎的推理更接近人类判断。我们的结果挑战了更多推理总是能带来更好的大型语言模型决策的默认假设，特别是在高风险的金融应用中。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [21] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCALe, a benchmark addressing the unreliability of LLMs as logic translators due to their struggle with lexical diversification. It also proposes MenTaL, a method that enhances LLM performance on lexically diversified text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unreliability of LLMs in handling lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, which is obscured by existing logical reasoning benchmarks lacking lexical diversity.

Method: Introducing SCALe, a benchmark for logic-invariant lexical diversification, and proposing MenTaL, a method guiding LLMs to construct a table unifying diverse expressions before translation.

Result: Experiments using SCALe confirm current LLMs' deficiencies in translating lexically diversified text. MenTaL, when applied through in-context learning and SFT, improves LLM translator performance on such text.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with lexical diversification, a problem addressed by the SCALe benchmark and resolved by the MenTaL method.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [22] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces a gradient matching approach for selecting demonstrations in in-context learning, improving performance compared to random selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of random selection in many-shot ICL by introducing a more effective demonstration selection method.

Method: The method involves aligning fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples.

Result: The result is that the proposed method consistently outperforms random selection on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel gradient matching approach to select demonstrations for in-context learning, which outperforms random selection on larger LLMs.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training-free method called SUCEA for automatic fact-checking, which improves retrieval and entailment label accuracy on adversarial claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat misinformation and improve fact-checking systems' ability to handle adversarial claims.

Method: Proposes a modular framework called SUCEA that decomposes the task into three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves retrieval and entailment label accuracy on two challenging fact-checking datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free method SUCEA can effectively rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate supporting evidence.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark called MuSciClaims is introduced to assess scientific claim verification abilities using multimodal data from scientific literature. Most vision-language models perform poorly (0.3-0.5 F1), with the best achieving 0.77 F1, due to biases and difficulties in localizing evidence and understanding figure components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark that directly tests claim verification abilities in scientific literature with multimodal data.

Method: Automatically extracting supported claims from articles and manually perturbing them to produce contradicted claims. Introducing diagnostic tasks to understand model failures.

Result: Most vision-language models perform poorly, with even the best only achieving 0.77 F1. Models are biased towards supporting claims and struggle with localizing evidence and understanding figure components.

Conclusion: There is a need for better vision-language models capable of accurately verifying scientific claims using multimodal data from scientific literature.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

TL;DR: LESS is a framework using LLMs to refine pseudo labels from ASR or AST data, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semi-supervised learning in speech processing tasks using large language models.

Method: Refining pseudo-labeled text through LLMs and optimizing with a data filtering strategy.

Result: LESS improves ASR and AST performance significantly, reducing WER and improving BLEU scores.

Conclusion: LESS demonstrates broad applicability across languages, tasks, and domains, providing valuable insights for leveraging LLM knowledge in speech processing.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Motivation: 现有的方法如过程奖励模型（PRMs）或自我一致性等不能提供检查证据来缓解链式思维中的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出了一种回顾性的、步骤感知的形式化验证框架Safe，在每个推理步骤中用形式化数学语言Lean 4表达数学主张，并提供正式证明以识别幻觉。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种数学数据集上评估了Safe框架，显示出了显著的性能提升，并提供了可解释和可验证的证据。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试使用形式化数学语言Lean 4来验证由大型语言模型生成的自然语言内容，与形式化数学语言被创造出来的初衷一致：为容易产生幻觉的人类书写证明提供坚实的基础。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Motivation: Existing scientific NLI datasets mainly focus on CS domains, ignoring non-CS domains. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing a new benchmark covering non-CS domains.

Method: Established baselines using SLMs and LLMs.

Result: The best baseline model achieved a Macro F1 score of 78.17% on the MISMATCHED benchmark. Incorporating implicit scientific NLI sentence pairs into training improved model performance.

Conclusion: A new scientific NLI benchmark named MISMATCHED is introduced which includes three non-CS fields and 2,700 sentence pairs. The best baseline achieved a Macro F1 score of 78.17%, indicating room for improvement.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of less diverse outputs produced by reasoning-optimized models, which limits Test-Time Scaling effectiveness.

Method: ADAPT applies prefix tuning with a diversity-focused data strategy.

Result: ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong baselines.

Conclusion: ADAPT is a lightweight method that improves Test-Time Scaling effectiveness by focusing on generative diversity.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

<details>

Motivation: Existing studies focus on the role of social structures in shaping innovation capacity. This study aims to explore how personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities affect creativity.

Method: The study uses dynamic language representations to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities. It also analyzes data from millions of people across different creative fields.

Result: Measured subjective perspectives can predict what ideas individuals and groups will creatively attend to and successfully combine in the future. Angular differences between collaborators' perspectives anticipate creative achievement, while differences in experiences do not.

Conclusion: This study shows that subjective perspectives and background diversity have different impacts on creative achievements. Successful collaborations rely on common language to integrate diverse experiences.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

Result: Our model outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks and rivals SimCSE on some datasets.

Conclusion: Our method successfully removes irrelevant word embedding components and adjusts vector norms based on word influence on sentence semantics.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Proposes Tool-MVR, a novel Tool-Augmented LLM, to enhance tool utilization capabilities with two key innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models have limitations in tool planning, invocation, and reflection abilities.

Method: Introduces Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reduces API calls, and improves error correction rates.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR surpasses previous models in performance and efficiency on both StableToolBench and RefineToolBench.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that

*Thai-Binh Nguyen,Thi Van Nguyen,Quoc Truong Do,Chi Mai Luong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work introduces an approach to create AVSR datasets from raw video for improved efficiency and accessibility, demonstrating its application by building a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese, which performs well in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of scarce datasets in AVSR, especially for non-English languages, and improve robustness against noise.

Method: Developing a practical method to automatically collect AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques.

Result: The automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline for Vietnamese AVSR, performing competitively in clean conditions and outperforming in noisy environments.

Conclusion: This method could help expand AVSR to more languages, particularly under-resourced ones.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

### [33] [TaDA: Training-free recipe for Decoding with Adaptive KV Cache Compression and Mean-centering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04642)
*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method called TaDA is introduced for compressing the key-value (KV) cache in transformer models without needing to separately manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient decoding or inference in large language models requires reducing the memory demands of the KV cache which scales poorly with sequence length.

Method: TaDA uses quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling.

Result: Experiments show that TaDA reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: TaDA offers a training-free solution for KV cache compression in transformer models enabling scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

### [34] [Flex-TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Flexible Planning with Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04649)
*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flex-TravelPlanner, a new benchmark for evaluating language models' flexible reasoning abilities in dynamic planning scenarios. It adds two new evaluation settings: sequential constraint introduction and prioritized competing constraints. Analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B shows that single-turn task performance doesn't predict multi-turn adaptability, constraint order affects performance, and models struggle with prioritizing constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities only focus on static, single-turn scenarios, while real-world planning requires adapting to changing requirements and balancing competing constraints.

Method: Introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, building on the TravelPlanner dataset, with two novel evaluation settings: sequential constraint introduction and prioritized competing constraints.

Result: Models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint introduction order significantly affects performance; models struggle with constraint prioritization.

Conclusion: Evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning scenarios is important, and the findings suggest directions for improving model performance on complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [35] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses the value alignment problem for large language models (LLMs), arguing that current alignment strategies are not enough to prevent misuse due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks exploiting norm conflicts. It suggests that existing methods only create superficial behavioral dispositions rather than enabling genuine normative deliberation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities of current alignment strategies in preventing misuse of AI systems.

Method: Analyzing existing alignment methods and comparing them with human moral psychology.

Result: Current alignment methods for LLMs are superficial and leave them vulnerable to adversarial attacks exploiting norm conflicts.

Conclusion: Current approaches are insufficient for mitigating potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the focus shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference.

Method: Designing a benchmark named MMRefine which evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and correct errors across six distinct scenarios.

MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为REWIRE的方法，通过增强低质量文档来提高预训练数据的使用效率，实验表明这种方法可以提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练方法依赖于大量的网络爬取，但高质量文本的可用性有限，数据过滤管道通常会删除99%的初始网络抓取数据。

Method: REWIRE方法，即通过指导重写来回收网络数据。

Result: 在DCLM基准测试的1B、3B和7B规模下，混合高质量原始文本和重写文本分别提高了1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点的性能，而且混合文本中有约82%来自原本会被丢弃的低质量文档。

Conclusion: REWIRE方法通过增强低质量文档，使其对训练有用，从而在DCLM基准测试中提高了模型性能，并且比访问两倍网络数据更有效。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法提升隐式仇恨言论检测，通过大型语言模型结合编码策略，在中英数据集上均取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动检测方法在识别显式仇恨言论方面表现良好，但在隐式仇恨言论检测上存在困难。

Method: 引入了新的隐式仇恨言论检测分类法，定义了六种编码策略，并提出了两种整合这些编码策略的方法：直接提示大型语言模型对句子进行分类，以及在编码过程中嵌入编码策略使用大型语言模型作为编码器。

Result: 实验表明，使用编码策略可以提高中文和英文数据集中的隐式仇恨言论检测效果，验证了该方法在不同语言中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的新分类法和方法有效提高了隐式仇恨言论的检测能力，且具有跨语言适用性。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

TL;DR: STAND is a new model-free decoding method that speeds up language model reasoning by 60-65% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between performance and efficiency in language model reasoning.

Method: Introduces STAND, which uses stochastic drafting and a logit-based N-gram module to improve token acceptance rates.

Result: Reduces inference latency by 60-65% across multiple models and tasks without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: STAND is a powerful, model-free solution for accelerating language model reasoning that can be easily integrated into existing models.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation techniques play a crucial role in improving the performance of the SeamlessM4T model for low-resource speech translation.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT improves multiple LLMs' performance by collective competition and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diversity in generation and biases in evaluation of a single model.

Method: Multiple LLMs form a 'sparta tribe' to compete against each other and serve as judges for the competition of others. A adapted elo-ranking based reputation system is used to aggregate evaluation scores, and the preference pairs are used to update all models.

Result: SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT is shown to be effective in improving the performance of multiple LLMs across various tasks and datasets.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
