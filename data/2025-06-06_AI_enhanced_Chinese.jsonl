This work\npresents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and\nrecognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three\nstate-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across\nlayers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally\ndecreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving\nattributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs\nheavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of\naggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning\npositions.

However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus\non reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been\ncompromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously\nreinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to\noverlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment\ndata. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails\nthrough the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment\ndatasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that\nhigh similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,\nmaking models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity\nbetween these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and\nthus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%.
